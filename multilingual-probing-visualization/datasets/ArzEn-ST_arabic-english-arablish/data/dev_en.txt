i go home if i .. if i don't have trainings.
if we have trainings, we finish trainings, then we go home.
and that's it, and we have lunch, and the .. the usual things in a typical day i mean.
the weekends mainly family, so we visit the two families and .. or if we have trainings as well or if we i mean want to hang out.
my hobbies disappeared , we know that.
it was .. no my hobbies are mainly related to .. more reading. so i normally do that everyday any time at night or so.
and .. and the and the and the traveling has become mainly for example in our vacations, it is now related to the school's schedule.
it's a new school gulf english school.
international british.
at the beginning, he was in national school, when he was in kg1, but actually from the beginning, i wanted british schools as they provide better education and so.
that's it, so this school had just opened this year, so i mean i liked the system there and i decided to try it because i didn't like the previous one.
the most words, i mean, in which language?
he started english, i was forced to that, because it was according to the school's system.
and the most words no he already speaks like us, he expresses himself normally %bey .. about his feelings and his emotions and he can speak well now.
yes, no, i have read that a child can learn more than one language but as you say, he shouldn't use both in the same sentence.
i mean, to make it clear to him, that ((sometimes)) i talk in arabic, the whole sentence is in arabic, and ((at other times)), i can talk in english, and the whole sentence is in english. so even if i don't do that daily, i focus on this with him. that i have to %a .. say the sentence properly so that he learns it, so i mean, so he can differentiate.
no, unfortunately, ((nothing gets engraved  in my mind)) .
i don't have a favorite quote i mean.
the last book i have read was ghorbat al yasmeen.
i usually read arabic books more.
i mean, i love reading arabic books more.
it talked about a girl who was living abroad and %ash .. i mean worked abroad and what happened to her while she was abroad and so on.
i don't remember the details much, but i mean that was mainly the idea of the book.
no, i listen to arabic more often.
i like listening to oldies more, i mean fayrouz, magda el rumi i like old singers more.
i was majored in met and computer science.
look, my bachelor project was in augmented reality.
at that time, it was very booming, i mean, since how many years, i won't say, so at that time, i mean, it was difficult, i mean it was challenging to do that.
we used to make location page service, that you for instance, if i will go around the university so it will show me the .. the points of interest.
i mean if i am standing in front of the platform down there for instance, it will then show me the the the restaurants and the booths that we have.
no, i was, i mean, actually when i was young ((i was tending more towards)) pharmacy.
that was my dream job.
but then, when i joined engineering and joined computer science, so i started feeling that i, i mean %mm .. i mean, i like to understand people and so, so that's why, i mean, i tried working as a teacher.
definitely student at the university is much better because you have far less responsibilities, but still now i can't go back i mean, i mean i will never think of going back again, but for sure, i mean, these were better days.
i mean not the .. the teaching, i mean, i like research more, honestly, i like teaching, but it's ((not what i'm here for)), so if i get an opportunity to do research at an institute or a company or so, i will definitely go for it.
yes the dilemma .. no, i mean, of course i wish to travel but i am staying here mostly for the sake of my family.
i mean, i fear to even get an opportunity so as not to reject it for the sake of my family because, in the end, we all want to travel abroad given that the country is not at its best state, i mean.
you're right, i traveled .. africa uganda, this was when i was very young, and i traveled to places, yes i mean, i traveled to germany, i traveled for tourism to cyprus, switzerland, and sudan, if you want more, i traveled to other places as well  .
the place i have traveled to and liked the most, was maybe because of the traveling mood itself, was thailand and malaysia, maybe because maybe because it was the honeymoon so i won't forget that, and .. and the weather there was very exceptional and their trips there were really amazing.
no, all my travelings, i mean, i haven't traveled for a long period of time to, i mean, do so  .
all my travelings were of short duration so we aren't friends actually, i mean, we can get to know a person, i mean, but nothing more.
okay, the biggest turning point was the moment of delivery, this was the moment my life, really i mean, turned upside down.
well the change is huge, yes, i mean, you, i mean, i cannot really describe it, i mean, nobody can feel it unless one goes through it, but you really enter as a person and exit as a person who changed one eighty degrees because now there's somebody depending on you twenty four hours and there is somebody you should always take care of.
so your personality, if, for instance, you're a bit careless, no, you change suddenly.
if you didn't care so much, all details will now matter to you.
if you were calm, you become be nervous.
so maybe i have this skill, that i listen.
yes, of course, i mean, if we are talking about family, so for me, my father is my role model in everything and prophet muhammed is our role model, i mean, in general, in morals and so.
so .. i mean those are the most people who, whenever i face any situation i would think about what they would do, especially when i don't like how i have reacted, so i would start thinking, i mean, what would i have changed according to their attitude i mean.
no, this is a tough question.
for me, it honestly depends on the situation.
i mean inside the classroom, i might slightly, no, i'd rather be respected more because, i mean, somebody might love me but if he does not respect me inside the class that would be a problem, but in the .. in everyday life, of course a balance of both, i mean, is the best thing, i mean, but in everyday life i might tend more towards being liked, i mean, that no one is upset with me, i mean.
i feel that i, for instance .. i mean, i feel that, thank god, i give people a chance to easily come and talk to me, i hope, i mean, it is that way, really.
i mean, i recently felt that more when i grew up and understood, so i felt that i find people coming and talking to me about their problems or so, so i started to feel that it's because i listen, i mean, i listen to people and i might, i mean, like listening to their problems, and i may not provide them with a solution and sometimes this is what a person is looking for, someone to listen to him and that's it, i mean, not just to solve his problem i mean.
so maybe i have this skill, that i'm a good listener.
could be, yes, sometimes.
yes, i mean, at least you might be afraid and careful while talking and afraid to say something wrong.
and in the .. most probably you might feel that you're not comfortable and that you don't like their tone or you don't like their conversation or so, i mean.
so really it could be like that.
you mean type, or someone in particular?
yes, i mean, the characters that .. that .. what are they called? i don't know, those who believe that they are always right, i can't deal with them, because, i mean, i feel that whatever i say, it's done, he will not be convinced, so for me, i don't like dealing with that person.
have you ever tried before talking in english to let someone, i mean, notice that you understand? i mean, to make him feel that you understand and so on?
yes, i tried it in the school interview.
when you apply to a school, you will go through this stage if god wills, in order to impress them, in order to show them that you are, i mean, amazing, you must speak in english, even if they didn't ask you to do so.
but this is well-known in school interviews, if you speak this way, you will impress them, i mean.
i feel like you'll say that you did that with me in the evaluation  .
no, honestly, i can't remember a situation where i did that.
no, that's the only time i remember well that i was %bast .. i mean, not pretending, but, i mean, that i .. i don't usually talk in english, ((normally i mean)), %b .. i interchange i mean, i can say a word or two or so, but normally, no, i mean, so it was only that time.
okay,  i mean, it could be that i'm a good listener, i mean, is one of things that i like a bit and also that i like giving excuses to people, i mean, i feel deep down that this is good.
but i can't say anything else.
it pressures, of course.
i mean many times i can go home psychologically exhausted or nervous or so ((deep down)) because i have been trying all day to be a better person and %b .. to understand and listen and %b .. give excuses and so on.
by the end of the day, you break down, unwillingly, i mean.
not exactly, but at some point you become affected by people's problems.
i mean, truly you place your head on the pillow at night, and keep thinking about all the problems you hear all day and this is very tiring, especially if you are already have enough problems, i mean, but you don't %beteh .. i mean, you don't like talking about it in the morning or so.
no, unfortunately, it has become essential part of my life, i mean, especially and .. and that there is someone, this is also the idea that you, after the .. someone is attached to you, so there is someone who i really fear they might give me a call telling me to come immediately, so no, i cannot leave my mobile.
it it runs out of battery, i mean, i freak out.
okay, i can convince you to complete your master's, to do your master's after you graduate.
it seems that someone here is not convinced.
yes, directly, why so?
because i have seen many examples, including myself, as i took a break after the .. after i graduated to try industry for a year or two and if i don't like i will go back, however, when i decided to go back it was .. going back was really hard.
i mean that you go back to studying and to have deadlines and .. there are also deadlines at work, but to have a superior .. i mean your supervisor, that mood you forget this kind of mood after a year or two, so .. so it takes more time.
and from my experience with .. with people around me, including myself, when you take a break, you take a long time.
it took me a long time to complete my master's because of this break and because of my life circumstances.
but those who .. who finish and concentrate and .. and i am pro, of course, that you travel actually, but whether you take it from here or from .. from there, from abroad  they finish it in a year or so or even less, are you convinced?
look, i believe so.
my husband, for example, took the other career path, that is from the very start, he's working in companies and so, he didn't peruse a master's degree, however,  %bn ..  from the .. in his company, you find master's holders have an edge.
i mean the degree is really important even if it's not mentioned in the requirements, i mean there are many companies that don't require that at all.
but he feels that the other person is experienced, so even after .. after some years he receives %cert .. till this day he receives certificates and he tries to study hard to compensate for this difference.
this actually always allows you to get promoted faster and so.
thank you  .
i studied at an ordinary national school.
and i was in an experimental school until around grade four and then i moved to a private school.
and after that it was .. i was in general secondary education.
and that's it, and i have bachelor project this year.
yes, i am from cairo.
my bachelor project is about vr.
how to manipulate objects in virtual environment.
and i will do it in munich, if god wills.
in the .. i mean currently  i wake up, go to the university, stay for a while and learn a few things about my bachelor project.
and i also run some errands.
but usually, i finish university, i go home play or watch matches at night, and that's all.
i am a barcelona fan.
%h %b .. %b game online.
game online
we play over watch.
we play ..
i mean if we have money, we can play other things.
i prefer listening to english songs.
i also listen to arabic songs but the majority of songs is english.
i don't have favorite songs .. i don't have a favorite singer because sometimes i listen to music only without vocals.
i play basketball.
%b .. i love football but thank god, god did not make me talented in football, so i am not that good at it.
no, i played basket until before general secondary, and after that i stopped, i now longer played.
but i watch football.
the thing, media i mean, i like watching the most, was nurato.
i love nurato very much.
this is an anime, not a movie actually.
why do i love nurato? because the character i mean, nurato has .. has a nice personality honestly, you will like it, watch it.
yes, yes, nurato is a ninja  .
and .. that's all, so he %fel .. i mean they are divided into clans and so, so all each ninja is supposed to try to become something called a hokage or kage of his clan.
to be able to defend the whole clan.
so he was the most  what can we say about him? i mean he used to love his clan very much.
i mean he showed love and .. and respect to the whole clan and that he always wanted to protect them and he did protect them many times and so.
because i want to contribute in the technology.
i mean, that will help the whole world later on.
this will be something .. i mean that will affect the whole world later on.
i mean i just wish to participate in the technology, nothing more.
no, i don't want anything that is routine.
freelancing or my own business i mean.
yes, i went for several internships and several part-time jobs.
should i talk about them you mean?
the first thing that i did was internship web .. web developer and app developer.
and it was an internship at start, after that, after i had finished the internship, they told me do you want to work with us part-time?
i told them okay.
afterwards, i left them and then i went for an internship in indonesia under aiesec.
after that i came back and worked as a part-time developer here, working on the things that i have learned in the internship in indonesia.
and that's it, and i have just left the part-time job a month ago.
i mean i have traveled to saudi arabia, but i mean only indonesia outside the middle east.
indonesia or saudi arabia?
indonesia has nature that doesn't exist in egypt or in the arab world actually.
yes, i made friends with the host .. with the hosting family that i stayed with.
i am still in touch with them till this day.
tokyo.
because it is the place with the highest technology in the world.
and i mean they are discipline and .. and more advanced technology, more than any other place.
they are organized and everything.
no, of course, i will accept the opportunity  .
no, more questions about this and you know where we're headed  .
my last trip in egypt  was to alexandria or dahab? alexandria.
yes, alexandria.
and actually, i think aswan is the most beautiful city in all egypt.
and it's the most beautiful city that i have ever visited so far in general i mean, in all the countries that i have visited.
they are indonesia and saudi arabia i mean.
so what did i do over there? honestly, you do nothing but admire the nile, so it's very enjoyable.
no.
maybe when i wanted to join ain shams university.
i really wished to join ain shams university .. faculty of engineering at ain shams university, very much.
i was upset that i didn't get the grades required for joining ain shams university in high school.
afterwards, i realized that i was really stupid.
in god's name, actually it depends on the team, if the team is not good, then i don't want to work with them. if the team is good, then i would like to work with the team rather than work alone.
i remind him of the ..
i remind him of the big picture and what goal we want to achieve.
and what we want to reach.
so this is supposed to encourage him, if he has joined the team for a certain reason.
naruto
we have already said this.
because he wanted to be a kage and to take care of his clan.
and ((he was doing a good job)), honestly.
i mean i'd like a little bit of both, respecting through liking me i mean
no, there has to be a period of ice breaking.
i don't know, sometimes i feel that i'm weird.
that i am weird  .
yes, ignorant people.
no, if somebody is less than me socially, or less than me in anything else, i can deal with him normally, but if a person doesn't want to learn something new or doesn't want to go out of the bubble that he is in, then no, i wouldn't want to deal .. deal with him.
if a person doesn't want to learn anything new in life, then he wants to stay the same .. inside the bubble that he is in, so we will keep him in the bubble that he is in.
that i don't turn off the lights and i don't tidy up my room.
i have sometimes pretended like i understand while i don't.
but i don't use english for such a reason i mean.
no, i have never done this before.
stressful and very nervous.
football matches.
no.
because i use the internet for everything.
and i mean, for a person like me who doesn't like reading books, that i search the internet for any info that i want, so the internet is essential for me, and to have it on a laptop or computer, but that will ((hold me back)), so it has to be on the mobile actually.
do you believe that football players deserve these salaries they take?
millions and more.
why so?
okay, now these football players i mean, for example, when you graduate from university, what would be your preferable income in the company that you'll be working in? in what range for instance?
no, but, you will bring to your company, not to your home, how much profit will you bring to the company you're working in?
just range i mean.
let's say from ten to fifty k per month?
now if you take a look at a football player, a player like mohamed salah for instance or ronaldo or messi.
so, per week, if he plays .. played a football match, look at the sponsors that will earn money .. he wins .. that means people will buy the products that he is wearing, he let's .. look at the stadiums .. the number of people who go to that stadium to watch that match and buy the ticket to watch it.
how many people are going to subscribe in a tv channel to watch mohamed salah playing that match?
so per match, he may get one million from all the people.
so when you pay this player one million per week because he brings two millions per week, so he deserves this money because this is the income that he brings to the company he works in.
regardless of whether he got exhausted or not.
plus, someone like mohamed salah, when he scores a goal in a match, how many people does he make happy in the whole world?
how many people do you make happy when you make such an application bachelor?
okay, actually, i think happiness may be prepaid, so this is a good price that he earns, i mean.
okay, so i was born in cairo.
okay  living .. should i say where i'm living?
i live, for instance, in ramses in a very local place, eldaher and elfagaala.
my school was close to home.
it was a french school.
okay i was in a national school.
it was a national school.
i was in a national school, i was in general secondary.
i passed and joined engineering, thank god.
and i majored in computer engineering.
and currently, i am only a teaching assistant for now.
okay  so why did i choose computer engineering? because i suddenly liked coding once i learned cs.
i liked coding very much.
and i used to hate mechanics so i wasn't planning on joining anything related to mechanics.
so i went for computer engineering.
and dived more into cs because i wanted to know more about hardware and the embedded systems.
i was interested to learn more about hardware, more than anything else.
more than computer graphics or sound or acoustics or anything else.
my bachelor project was about that i am doing an application to encourage the user to reduce their using of electricity at home.
but mainly it had a gamification element which this will encourage the user to reduce the electricity by always informing the user how much electricity he consumed in this month so far.
and that he can set goals for himself such that by the end of month he can say that he will use a maximum of 10 thousand kilo watt.
so if he managed to do so it's good for him, will be saved in the records.
if he failed for instance, he will get a feedback that his consumption is still high.
this was my bachelor project.
and it was actually part of the master project of another teaching assistant, that's all.
okay so basically, i wake up in the morning, one washes his face, and have my breakfast then work, university.
and sometimes i have on some days, or not so, teaching, so i teach and then i go home, sleep for a while, then i go to the café, or i can hang out afterwards.
and in the weekends just sleeping and playing playstation and going to the café at night as well.
i don't have a great hobby.
yes, most of the time i like listening to music and i always watch movies.
but mainly the hobby that i am sometimes enthusiastic to do, i like playing tennis often.
i used to play tennis sometimes at the university as well and then i stopped.
but i wish to go back and play tennis.
okay, my favorite song is french, it's called belle by garou.
but this is my favorite song that i always like listening to.
i don't remember.
i don't have a favorite movie honestly.
the problem is that ((i can't remember all the names)) right now.
i prefer listening to english songs.
no, not at all.
no.
okay so i'd love to enroll my children in a french school or french more and maybe followed by a deutsch school.
because deutsch is common nowadays and has a good future in the market.
french because in my point of view french schools are the best, not in education, but in discipline because treatment in our schools is different from other schools.
that's all and but i may enroll them in an ordinary national school.
it's not worth them going to international school unless they will need to travel abroad, or so, or i can afford his traveling, in this case i can enroll him in international school.
but actually i will go for the national school, and it's good, it's not bad.
i i still, i will go for french.
honestly, i love french, so i will still go for the french.
and i will teach them french words so that when they grow up they would be fluent in french.
it's not .. it's not .. it's not difficult for them, i mean.
okay so basically when i graduated, i felt lost, like any other graduate.
i didn't know whether i should go for a company or complete my masters.
so i thought i'd try applying at the university.
if i get accepted, i will complete okay masters and that would be god's will.
if i didn't get accepted, then i will go to the .. i will go then for corporate or something
so actually i got accepted at the university.
and i wasn't upset at all that i will work in the academic career because i actually love teaching.
and i was a junior ta for a period of time so i have tried this and i love the academic life a bit.
that's it, so that's why i chose to be academic.
so i imagine that sometime after i finish the masters and i acquire a good amount of experience that i actually go for an r and d department in any good company.
i hope it's a multinational company.
okay and i hope i can be a project manager or any other good position.
that's it, that's the .. and get promoted to be a manager one day i mean.
what should they do exactly you mean?
liked or respected?
it's a tough question.
liked or respected?
respected.
i don't have to be liked.
in all cases, nobody will love not everyone will love me, so the important thing is that i'd be respected.
but not out of fear, that is most importantly.
respected is not very common but okay well.
so i will go for respected in general i mean.
okay so when i was a student at the university i did three internships in three different companies.
okay so two of the companies i was just learning how they were working.
i tried once to work with them.
they let me work with them on a task.
okay but i did not like it much.
i mean, i felt that there is no way i'd spend five years of my life working on such a thing, ((it will be lost)) .
in the last one, he made me implement a program as a desktop program to help them at work.
and i liked this job.
i mean i was going there to implement and add something to the company there.
i won't be like everyone else.
and i will help people in a different way.
so this was the best internship i had honestly i mean, that's all.
no, honestly, i really miss being a student once more, whether at school or at university, because the working life is just routine, if one couldn't break it in any way, one will live all his life going to sleep, waking up, going to work, going to sleep, waking up, going to work.
and then, when i was a student i used to have at least mid-year recess and final recess.
now one is working all year long.
so no, it was much better when i was a student actually.
yes.
okay.
are you talking about outside egypt?
i haven't traveled a lot, but actually i have traveled abroad a lot.
actually the place ((i enjoyed the most)) was venice.
but the sea view and the boats, i don't remember what it's called honestly, but the boats, it was a spectacular view honestly i mean.
i wasn't expecting to see such a city in the first place.
and it was really like the pictures in reality.
so venice is the most thing is the most city that i really liked the most when traveling abroad i mean, that's all.
actually, when i am not very sociable because sometimes i feel shy.
so .. so no, i didn't make a lot of friends, unfortunately.
((they were few)), one or two maximum.
and no, we don't talk at all.
it was just to hang out during my stay there and that's it.
we don't have any other contact.
yes.
actually the pyramids, because until now i haven't yet visited them.
so i wish i could see it, i wish so, that's all.
but probably i will stay here i won't travel because i am afraid.
it's really frightening to travel abroad alone.
so i think probably, in the beginning, no, i will stay here, i won't be able to travel abroad.
unless i will come back here, i won't continue my life abroad, okay i can do that.
but if i would stay abroad for good, no i think i wouldn't say no, that's it.
okay last vacation or last trip?
actually, last trip was just one day, a day use in el sokhna.
it was just a crazy idea we had at night, that we go and sit by the beach.
we just sit by the sea and eat and drink and come back just to change the mood instead of boredom.
that was the last .. last nice trip.
it may be the first grade i got in the midterm in the first year at university, it was kind of a turning point with regards to my way of thinking and with regards to my future plans for my university years.
because i had just finished the general secondary and i thought i am very clever and suddenly i joined university and i felt lost and that i don't understand a thing and the first midterm grade was 55 percent and it was in math.
it was really terrible for me.
so i felt that there was something wrong.
i don't feel comfortable.
and i have to find out what is going to let me pass these five years without feeling tired and to try to fix the social life as well.
that is i don't want to be in the ranking but i still want to have a social life.
i somehow feel that this was my turning point.
okay so for the projects, if it was mainly one project only for the whole semester, i would have liked of course to work individually because i love to know everything about the project, from a to z.
and i prefer that when a part goes wrong, it would be my fault and not someone else's.
i know my own potentials.
i know that i will work on the project until it's done.
that's the idea, that's why i prefer working individually.
but in teams i always had to choose the people i am going to work with.
to know that he actually works well.
because in the team, i can be with someone that doesn't work and ((i will be responsible for everything)) .
and of course, i will get tired among all the projects.
i i do not tolerate when somebody makes a mistake or ((holds me accountable for his mistake)) .
you had a task, you must do it completely.
it's your job.
you're a grown up and you're sane so you're supposed to finish it.
so that's why i always prefer working alone, so that i would only be accountable for my mistakes.
so that's why i prefer to work individually i mean.
so can i say names of the doctors, is this okay?
for the social life, i don't have a role model honestly.
but for the academic life, he is my role model i mean because actually he is very respected by the students although he doesn't do anything.
actually he really doesn't .. doesn't .. doesn't give them anything to make them love him.
they really love him.
his character, he has a great charisma.
the way he explains is really good because he is very .. i mean, he's very passionate about what he teaches.
even that he repeats a course like cs one for example and cs two every year, and teaches it with the same enthusiasm.
i really wonder how he likes this.
actually i got fed up when i taught cs2 for the second year now.
so that's why he is my role model.
he's able to make the students always attached to him.
he is always getting their attention the whole hour and a half.
so this is my role model who i am trying to learn from and i attend the lectures and see how he teaches and i try imitating him in my tutorials to make people really like cs in the future.
no, i'm not an easy person at all.
i need to let them in first.
even if he stayed for a year with me and i don't want to talk to him, he won't talk to me, no matter what he does.
why?
i don't trust people.
and i don't like the idea that people become my friends easily.
i mean we won't be friends in ((a day or two)) .
you need to get the visa as they say.
if i would be dealing with them consistently every day, i think, yes, i need to change how i talk, but if it's just for one minute a day, no, because there's not much to be said.
but if it's every day, i have to change my way not only to understand one another but also because if i talk to him in english he won't understand me.
i need .. if every day, yes, i need to change my way.
actually the .. the ((hypocrite)) .
who acts in a way among certain people and acts in another way with other people.
so, no, i can’t stay with you any longer.
seek someone else, not me.
you mean such a situation happened?
actually, i reply by saying that i don't know, directly so, and you can say whatever you want.
actually, not at all.
i didn't need to do so.
she already knows that i am not working well, so she gives me a grade according to the part that i understand.
no.
no, because i won't be able to communicate the rest of the people.
i mean, i won't know when i should leave, when i should go out, i mean.
still even if the mobile i just use it to know when i should meet up with people, so i hope to have it with me, because whenever i am among people i actually don't hold my mobile.
because i respect that i am sitting with other people.
so the mobile is the least favorite for me.
so i can't live without it, because i won't be able to meet anybody.
it will be very difficult.
i convince you with anything.
i don't know.
do you not want to be convinced with any particular thing?
to work as a ta and to pursue masters, actually i am convinced with this for 100 percent because besides that the masters is one hundred percent free, not really one hundred percent, but you won't pay much money except for the masters.
in general, teaching is nice job, because you have three months of summer vacation where you get paid without exerting any effort, you you don't have teaching at all.
and if you teach summer courses, you will get money for it over the monthly payment so .. which is a nice thing.
so unlike those who are working in corporates.
actually if you are working in corporate, you might always have a deadline, unlike the university here, you're generally ((not loaded)), but for example in the time of midterm, you need to finish corrections on time, the loaded times are parts of the semester.
so the .. the .. and here in this career you can take courses during the three months of summer vacation, to learn things, to develop yourself, in contrast to the corporates where if they did not help you, you will not be able to help yourself because you ((will be working hard)) all the time.
so .. so it .. working here is very good honestly.
i just hope you are convinced.
okay, i .. yes i am from maadi, i am originally from cairo, all my life i mean, and i have been living in egypt actually for all of my life, but i was born in saudi arabia, but right after i was born i came here, as my father was working in saudi arabia.
and i was in a school that had national and international sections, but i was in the national section. then actually opened the international section when i was midway.
but, but it was a very small school, i mean our class used to be .. i mean my class had twenty students, that's all  .
my class had twenty students, that was my class, i mean i .. we were one family, the whole class, in the end.
that's it, and after that .. yes, it was a small school in maadi that was close to home as well.
it was really nice, the school started at half past eight and i wake up at twenty to eight to be at school on time, so i used to avoid traffic jam.
and after that when i was done with third preparatory i moved to another school, i went for ig, i didn't like the other school at all.
they were the worst three years of my life, it was a very depressing school.
i mean i came from a school where we were all friends and it was a fun school, but then we moved to a dull school, i mean ((it was a hardworking school)) honestly, so they taught me how to study.
i mean in the first school .. i didn't use to study hard in the first school, it was more of an outing .. it was like i was going out every day, but then in the second school i needed to achieve high grades, so i had to go to a school where i can get good grades, that's it.
no, it was all in english, the first school was english and in the second school i was in ig, so it was english as well.
i joined the university, i knew from before that it .. it is engineering. i have loved math since i was young, i didn't learn anything in ig except for math and physics.
so that's why i joined engineering, then when i joined i had in mind to joining mechatronics or production or maybe cs, i mean i won't go far from these majors, i ((realized)) that i won't travel to another country and i will stay in egypt, so it was .. so i chose the university where i am here now, it was the best option i mean.
and then i joined .. i mean i joined and then after the first year i was supposed to choose the major so we were taking a cs course that it was really hard, i stayed like an hour trying to find .. i stayed for a whole day working on one error so i decided to not join cs because i get ((fed up quickly)) .
that's it, so after that i thought that i love cs as well so i want to choose major having cs as well, so i chose mechatronics.
that's it, and what was the question?
i'm working on a project called multi-robot system task allocation.
so it's .. it has to do with cs, so i code the robots, so it has to do with cs and mechatronics as well as i love both of them actually.
so, if you have multiple robots and multiple tasks you should be working on, so i just write the code for the robots so that they should handle these tasks, that's it.
and i chose the .. supposedly, i got the idea of the algorithm i'm using from bees, so my whole code is about bees.
i mean it's about bees, three kinds of bees, and we code like the bees' technique, just like bees get their food, our robots get the tasks.
okay, i don't get it actually, just like bees get their food, the robots get the tasks.
but, actually there are three types of bees in the beehive.
so, there are bees that go and search for food, then they call the other bees to get the food, and then when the food is finished, bees that are responsible for fetching food go and search for food.
so, the robot is made for this reason.
the .. the algorithm that they use is as follows, they will think of a path and then check the good path, i mean they find the path .. the good paths, they send other robots to the suitable paths based on probability.
and then when .. after it wanders a lot it it goes .. when they are done and the path turns out to be good, we know that it's good, it searches for another random path.
i get up at seven forty four, the minute matters as i have to lock my mobile.
and then, i get out of bed at seven fifty four.
that's it and then, i get up and i have my breakfast and the morning routine.
i come to college, i arrive here at half past nine or ten o'clock, i stay at college till five or four o'clock or according to my mood actually, that is daily, meaning five days a week.
after college, i usually don't have a lot of tasks to do at home, so i usually workout three or four times a week.
that's it, then i eat, rest for a while and then i sleep, i have no energy to do anything else actually.
on the weekends i get some rest and i hang out, actually as it's the only free time i have, that is i have no training, no college, so, i'm free on those two days, so i do whatever i want, i meet friends, go out, and so on.
not really, i prefer serenity.
i try to read, but i have never complete books.
the last book that i've read or i'm currently reading, i'm trying to currently read is called twelve .. shall i say its name? twelve rules of life.
it's a new book actually, published last year in two thousand eighteen.
that's it, this book, i mean i .. it's twelve .. it's about twelve rules for life, and i've just read the first two.
honestly, the book is a little bit boring but i'm just reading it because the person who .. the one who gave it to me .. i mean i really believe in that person.
so, i feel that it's a gift from that person, so, that's why i want to .. i mean this is why i want to read it, because he told me that this book is good and so on, just read it and you would find it beneficial.
that's it, so i'm actually trying to force myself to read it, also because i want to read and i don't usually read, i mean, basically all books are boring to me, but, actually, it's not really going well, but it's going, every while i finish reading a chapter.
the last movie i watched.
the movie i like the most is the dark knight, batman's dark knight because i feel that this movie has a lot of creative ideas.
i mean, the joker's character was supposed to be slightly cruel but actually .. in this movie .. but the joker is brilliant, i mean those who worked on the film, the directing and acting impress me each time i watch it, so, actually, i really love this movie a lot.
i haven't reached my dream job yet. but throughout my life, i have always wanted to work at a factory, in the .. in the production lines and at factories and so.
but i still don't know whether i want to continue doing this or not but actually this is one of the first things i want to do after graduation actually, that's it.
okay, yes, i used to work in camps when i was in my first year at college.
then, i quit for many reasons actually, but i'm still with them on the group and so.
i was supposed to do an internship last summer.
i arranged for it, and i was going to do the internship, then the camps' organizers called me before the .. i mean, they posted on the group before the internship saying that they have a camp in america and so but they don't have .. they're missing a member as his visa was rejected.
so they where looking for someone with a visa and i had the visa, so i contacted them and so and i inquired about the details, and they said the camp .. there's a camp in america, they took me, it was a very nice trip.
so, i declined the internship and i went to the camp with them.
so i haven't done any internships, so, i need to do many internships next summer to fill up my cv.
okay, can you tell me what was your role in these .. these camps? or .. and what was the organization .. what was the target of the organization? what was your vision?
my role wasn't a leader one, i was just .. actually the camp .. the campers were egyptians and the leaders were from usa. so, i was just filling the gap between them and the .. i was filling the gap .. the gap between them, and i was with them on the flight, that's all, this was my role, other than that i was just staying there .. staying there not doing much i mean, just having fun with them.
yes, i have just told you about the camp then i traveled again .. i mean i visited other countries, many actually.
the countries that i've traveled to, i've been to a lot of countries actually, i .. i initially told you .. actually that i was originally born abroad, and my father was working in saudi arabia, so i used to travel to him once every summer when i was in primary stage.
and i have been to nineteen countries in my life.
so, .. so yes, actually i have been to nineteen countries, i've been to many arab counties, saudi arabia and dubai and so on, and i have been to thirteen countries in europe in addition to america and so.
so, the country that i liked the most is italy, because italy is .. is very beautiful, and people there are simple actually, they are like egyptians but with a european style, and their food is delicious honestly.
and there were .. actually i have a lot of stories about traveling .. i mean i had a tour for two consecutive weeks, where i visited nine countries, so, i mean, visiting nine countries in fourteen days it was tiring, so i traveled a lot actually, that's it
i made friends not in europe but in the camp in the us, i came to know the leaders more, but, yes we still talk, every now and then we get in touch, and that's it i mean we contact each other every now and then, so yes.
the place the i liked the most in egypt was dahab i think.
i haven't traveled a lot internally in egypt, i'm trying to do that more often, but ((i can't get it right)) .. ((it doesn't really work for me)) .
but, the place i like the most in egypt i think is dahab. i felt as if it's not in egypt but at the same time it still belongs to egypt, i mean, it has the nature .. the egyptian nature and the .. and the rocks and so on, but the weather, the people, everything it's as if it's not in egypt.
that's all, so this is the thing i liked the most, as well as the seas and the .. i mean the lakes there and so on, so i think this is what i liked the most, that ((nature there is prevalent)) .
i really don't know .. actually i thought about this more than once, but i really don't know.
actually, i think if i had the chance, for a year or two or three, some limited time frame, i would go .. i will go, but if it's only actually easy i will go there without hesitating i mean.
but if it has to do with work or something, i believe i will go there for a while, i mean, i believe, i can go for a while then i probably come back eventually, i don't know think i .. i don't know .. i don't know how this will go .. if .. i thought a lot about this but i haven't made up my mind yet.
almost everyday during my finals keep thinking about changing my major  but .. but i have never done this.
could be in small teams, i don't do well in big teams, but in teams of three or four where we know how to deal with each other, and everyone is working well like i do, i believe things go well then.
he is not my role model, he is someone that i'm not trying to be like but rather i want to learn from him as .. as much as i can.
he is a friend of mine, we are of same age, he is in his twenties as well, it's not about him being my role model but i trust his opinion, it means a lot to me, i notice his actions, and i try in many things to learn from him, and so, that's it.
normally, i %bt .. i mean i .. actually i can open up and talk to a lot of people, i can talk to people i don't know.
i don't know how people see me, but i feel that i'm an easy person to talk to.
i can talk normally to people i don't know, but i don't know how people perceive me.
i feel that i should change my way of talking as well as my attitude.i feel that yes i should do this, i mean i do this when dealing with people from different standards, but i don't feel that this is difficult .. i mean i don't feel it's difficult.
i feel that i can interact but i change many things, i change .. and i change my outfit and a lot of things but i don't feel that there's a gap in dealing.
not really actually, no
it's not that .. not that i talk in english and say ((complicated words)) so other can't understand me.
i believe that, my friends say so, that i can bluff well, so ..
so, i wouldn't need to do this. i mean if i get stuck or something, i admit that i don't know or it will show, or you will find me bluffing and get done with it.
i once persuaded a friend of mine that i'm ranked the thirteenth worldwide in playstation and i have never played playstation before for instance, so ..
so, i'm good at this skill actually.
i don't know, but in general i can stay without a mobile, but it depends on what i'm doing.
i mean if i am doing something, i will leave my mobile.
i mean i usually keep my mobile away from me while studying, eating or doing anything else.
but i can stay without a mobile while i'm doing something, but if i'm not doing anything, i believe i essentially entertain myself by using the mobile actually, that's all.
actually, it doesn't go like that, i mean, you need to open a discussion, and i will focus on a certain thing, so,
so, let's travel?
don't you have a weekend, friday and saturday?
no, we will move thursday night, arrive friday morning, leave saturday night, arrive university sunday morning.
two days, forty eight hours.
why did i travel? .. no, you can sleep on the way.
this way, you saved money. if you .. if you .. you saved money since you spent a night in the .. in the means of transportation.
okay, i'm from bani suef.
i was in a national experimental school where we used to learn english, i was also taught french from first preparatory until secondary stage.
i joined major met computer science.
computer science is supposed to focus on programming software, but it also included some hardware and of course development, this is the meaning of computer science.
as for my bachelor, i was assigned to a project where i create an android application .. that would help the university.
actually, its aim was to help advising students, it can inform them for instance of their remaining courses, what exams they are eligible to, what subjects they can take in the first makeup or the second makeup, and so on, i mean, that was the project.
no, i quit this.
i have the topic, i started working on it, it's nlp.
i was supposed to be working on sentiment analysis for micro blogs in arabic, i mean, i take the tweets in twitter, the comments and replies in facebook that are written in arabic, and then we check the sentiment analysis, meaning that i classify it as positive comment negative comment, neutral, i was supposed to classify such text
on the normal workdays, of course i don't have enough time to do anything because i always get up late
for example, i have to teach, once i'm done with the tutorials, i can then have breakfast
then, i continue my day normally, i decide to maybe run late or do something at the university or not.
that's it, then i go to bed then wake up the next morning
okay, do you have certain hobbies that you like practicing during your free time or .. or for example do you have certain plans for the weekends?
yes, i've started to do something to break the routine i'm having, i .. i love learning languages, so i started a japanese course
i go twice a week.
actually, this is my hobby, i .. i love learning new languages, so, i have tried more than 15 languages but i loved japanese, that's why i'm focusing on japanese, and i'm trying to learn it currently.
yes, i used to read a long time ago, when i was young, kids' books and so, then i quit for a very long time, but two or three months ago i thought no, i must resume reading again, so, i went to the book fair and bought some novels, but ((there's still laying there somewhere)), i haven't started reading them yet, i've only read the short ones, but not all of course
i love reading both, but for sure i find arabic easier and i'm more used to it
i don't really remember
they are many, but i don't remember.
yeah, a lot, preferably languages other than english, anything but english
it is not a band there is more than one singer. i love spanish songs because of the .. the latin music. and since definitely, i love languages that's why i love spanish. so i love listening to shakira, enrique iglesias and .. there's also a spanish song by demi lovato that i love as well because it's in spanish.
honestly, you made it.
i just watched a movie that i used to watch several times because i .. i really like its story it's .. it's not actually childish but it's very interesting to girls  . the movie is revenge of the bridesmaids.
its story is about four friends including one that had a lot of loans so instead of selling their house, they decided .. to let one of them marry a wealthy man.
as if she stole .. the groom was a friend of one of her friends. after that, the three of them were the bridesmaids of this girl then they kept planning how to get him back till finally he returned back.
that's it.
of course japanese, as i learn japanese .
i can let them travel abroad as i'm a japanese.
of course, you've noticed that it has to do with languages. i hope i can travel abroad as i would go for career shift. i would do something apart from my major. i can go for translation or teaching; whatever has to do with languages.
after graduation, i was hired in the university so i haven't tried any other job. as for the internships, i have worked as a front end developer in two different companies. the duration of the internship was three months but i completed it in two years. i mean i attended the internship in two different companies but i used to work as a front end in both companies.
okay, i'll tell you something, when i graduated, you will also notice that when you graduate, it will be hard to part with university, not in the sense of the exams and so, but the its people, it has become your comfort zone because of the people you go to know.
that's it, so i can say that i worked there because of this reason.
another reason is that i love teaching. as a student, yes i loved the .. definitely university life, but, i don't know, when i .. i'm teaching, it's much better.
no
you should be the one answering this question.
of course, i want to travel to japan.
look, i haven't visited the temples there .. in luxor and aswan.
south, no, i haven't been to the south, but i have been to the far west, near libya.
do you know which one? that is marsa matrouh
i really love the governorate there. it's really nice, actually i really love it.
i like the sea itself, its water, you won't find a better sea anywhere else. that's why i like going there a lot, we've been there several times, then we stopped going there for some time, and now, we're back to traveling there.
if they asked me during my bachelor, i would have said that i prefer to stay here, but currently, if i have the chance to travel abroad, i would, but not for a long time.
yes, definitely.
i mean .. i couldn't remember exactly when, but i recall there's that there's a difference between first and second years of teaching.
there's a 180 degree of difference.
actually, i was nervous during the first year at work, i had just started, and i hadn't gotten to know people yet, i'm not yet familiar with the job, but in my second year, i got a hang of things
no, it depends actually, i can't decide individual or not, if the team is a strong one, they will encourage me to work with them, however, if the team is weak, i'd prefer to work individually.
no, i think it's not necessarily that people must love each other, people won't .. agree on one person, so i prefer being respected, this is better, of course.
yes of course, my mum
i mean she .. she is definitely .. she is an engineer so that's why my brother and i decided to go for engineering.
she is actually she .. she is actually a manager. she is the leader so i .. i wish to be like her as well.
i wish to be like her.
do you consider yourself an easy person to talk with without the need for ice breaking? or do you need time to get to know the other person, some ice breaking first, that people can't start a conversation with you easily?
no, absolutely not, i can start a conversation directly, and talk about different topics, that is totally fine
yes, of course, such things are really obvious, to know whether you can directly start talking to a person, or if he's an introvert for instance, so you need to find a way to start talking with him, you may discuss something that he's interested in just to break the ice.
actually, i .. i developed it lately, that is ((fun-loving)) .
it really makes a difference to be always smiling, well some people might say you're crazy, but it's a beautiful thing to be happy all the time.
okay, which quality in people do you find hardest to deal with? that you cannot deal with a person having this quality
definitely lying.
no, actually it's well known. people that .. that lie and change their words, i mean i have trust issues, so i won't .. won't trust them again actually.
currently, why did i join engineering and then want to work with languages?
that is if i understood the question correctly.
they criticize me for choosing engineering when i want to work in a total different field in the first place. they ask why?
why so?
in general secondary, talking about scores, and the maths section, so i used to love math. actually, i .. i joined engineering because i love math, and i really do love math, however, i also wished to join alsun.
unfortunately, i would have been assigned to alsun but in another city based on geographic distribution, i wouldn't have gotten ain shams for instance, which covers more diversity of languages, that's why we went for engineering and that was it.
if i'm stressed, for sure, if i have deadlines, definitely, actually this is the first thing if .. if i'm nervous. this just recently happened ..
i had a presentation in the japanese course that i was taking. i have stage fright, so i stressed myself out. i mean, i am good at explaining , i stand in front of students, and a lot of them. i made myself feel nervous, so this could be the reason, that i get nervous from new stuff and deadlines, that's all
let me share a situation with you
i was stood up to present something that i've worked on, like a portfolio showing what we have studied and .. how we ((keep information)) so that we can get back to it later, so, i stood up to present this but i got nervous and it was clear in my voice. ((i then overcame this)) by turning it into something funny actually.
i started joking and then everything went well, i started explaining, and that was it, as if nothing went wrong
no, repeat the question.
i cannot ((fabricate)) on the spot when talking, but i ((fabricate)) a lot in exams
i need time to figure out how to ((fabricate))
that's it.
yes, i have tried this before, i went out without a mobile for an hour, i often leave it behind actually
i wish i can do that, actually
it's pointless then
no, we can use the normal landline to communicate, we communicate once every few days to know share news, that's enough, but frankly, the mobile phone wastes time and good vision
okay, something to convince you of, overthinking, don't overthink
because ..
i mean, when you overthink, you come up with scenarios, you imagine scenarios that are impossible to happen, so, ((you waste mental effort)), you might get insomnia, so overthinking is pointless, think of the present only, stop overthinking.
think about one thing and that's it.
okay, okay at the beginning i was living in maadi, cairo.
at first, it was national français.
then, i joined an international ig school.
français and english, and then only english
i joined media engineering and technology.
why did i choose this major?
actually, it was very interesting for me.
generally speaking, i was interested in computer science especially in front-end, applications, games, things that belong to digital media in general.
i wanted to join computer science but i didn't .. i didn't know exactly what i wanted
afterwards, i started to like the major itself, once we actually became more specialized.
i guess starting from semester like five or so
once we stopped taking topics that were not really related.
that's it, so back then, i felt that
okay my bachelor was an online dxf to web gl converter.
it was all about inserting the language which is dxf and then converting it to another language, the web gl, as you can do this from one program to another program as they use different languages.
i started my masters in vr for hearing impaired people.
still not really settled
but for now, my target is supposedly to try to translate the gestures or what is it called? the .. the, yes, sign language to text or speech.
that's it.
what's your daily routine?
daily routine
okay, once i wake up, i get dressed then i wake my daughter up.
i take her to mummy so that i can go to work.
then, after work, i go get her and go back home.
i stay there for like two hours maximum then i try to put her to sleep, we start the process and only god knows how long it'll take.
until it's too late.
we sat together after a while.
and then bye bye.
no absolutely not, or maybe it used to be so
i used to love reading.
i didn't like reading scientific books.
like weird people
actually, i used to like books to enjoy my time.
mainly arabic
i like listening to songs, not a specific type, i mean i don't think i have a favorite type nor a favorite singer or so.
i mean i may like songs for different singers, and i pick the type according to my mood.
i'm not stuck in a certain thing.
okay
okay it didn't really influence me.
but .. i don't actually remember its story.
but i can tell you the names of movies that i've liked or so.
there's the shawshank redemption, i love it very much.
the story is simply based on person who got imprisoned, or something like that, and then to sum it up, he received money from another person and officially took it for himself.
but i don't feel actually that i was moved by any movie.
not a favorite quote, but something that i like, why have i just forgotten it?
wait i'll tell you, i'm sure you known it but i cannot remember the first part of it.
you know to be absent but present is better than being present but absent
no, to be present even if you're absent rather than being present but absent.
yes.
for example, i like that.
respected.
because i feel that respecting someone is a matter of respecting his personality but liking someone is not necessarily personality wise.
plus i feel that if i respect someone, then i can to a point or another that i i like his personality that i like whatever.
but if i like someone, i feel that i like him for something whatever it is, but once it's gone, that's it, do you get my point?
it's not necessary that i respect him actually ..
oh no, it's a year and two months actually.
international.
actually, i thought about several things.
at first, i wanted an international french school.
then, i felt that eventually it will end up that i studied french but then we use english because everything is in english.
i felt that i would rather go for english and to have it parallel with french.
she has to learn a second language in one way or another, in whatever way, if she's not learning it at school, she can take courses, but there should be two languages at least.
look, i'll tell you, honestly, right now, i feel that i go for whatever's easier.
i can go for arabic in some aspects and for english in other aspects.
i think it's easier for her to learn it now, this is what i try to do.
after that, when she goes to a nursery, it would .. it would be english.
but actually, they study arabic.
but still it depends on it.
there are things that are easier for her in english than arabic.
and it has an easier pronunciation and so
wedding planner
i wanted something different that the major.
what?
i don't know, i really liked it.
actually, i wasn't during college, during projects, during these stuff, ((i wanted to get done with it, i didn't want to go over it ever again)) .
but after i finished, ((i became wiser)) .
no
in what sense?
there are several things.
when you're a student, i believe you have less responsibilities.
i mean you're responsible for your own thing, for instance.
you're free, if i decide that i don't want to study today or i don't want to go to university today, it's up to me.
so i'm less responsible.
if i want to get good grades, i will study. if i don't care about grades, i won't study.
but i feel that when you're employed, you have a bigger responsibility, you are forced to get up even if you're lazy or sick. do you get my point?
things like that.
that's it, so i feel that in terms of responsibility, no, i definitely had less responsibilities when i was a student
it's okay to ((miss)) lectures or tutorials.
this is definitely another issue that we won't discuss but we should have it.
yes
the latest one was thailand.
you mean the most?
generally speaking, thailand was a different experience from the rest.
for example, i've also been to barcelona and so, but those that are .. i mean europe is generally is different from thailand and so, so thailand was a totally different culture, so it was different in every way, so you can easily remember it.
i mean i can remember it much more than barcelona, for instance
disneyland
disney world, i mean in america not .. not paris
not not france i mean.
or cape town i mean
cape town, it's nature, so i don't know if i want to go there.
disneyland because i have to go to disneyland.
personally speaking, for sure yes.
for me, i may not accept it depending on the duration and place, because i'm not single anymore, i have my own family, so, it depends, i don't know.
if i'm single, i will definitely accept it.
let's go.
i would love to, please.
maybe dahab and sharm el sheikh, and so.
that it's calmer than any other place people might visit.
i mean whenever you travel, it's always crowded and noisy bla bla bla.
but, no, i felt that the place there is quiet and people are relaxed. the sea is great and everything is beautiful.
yes, a lot of course.
like what?
at the beginning, i .. i couldn't stand staying at home at all, i had to go out, i had to .. i couldn't stand staying at home.
but now, i'm forced to stay at home often as it takes two hours to get ready to go out .. actually by the time we want to go out, it would be her bedtime. do you get it?
so, we are forced to stay at home.
i was also .. i was spontaneous when it comes to hanging out, ((i would easily hang out any time)) .
now, i might have arranged with you yesterday to go out and then i cancel everything today because something came up.
so, its all things of the sort.
so, no, my life has totally changed for sure.
okay back in college, did you prefer working on a project in teams or on your own?
mostly on my own, unless its a team that i know quite well and i get along well with the members.
what i mean by i don't know how to deal with them is that for instance i don't get along well with a person. but when i am working alone, i get to decide on my schedule sooner or later.
for instance, if i hadn't started yet and there's a deadline, i know that i will finish it tonight and submit it.
also, if i don't have time at night, i can do it in the morning and submit it. it's up to me.
but if i'm in a team, i must be more committed.
for instance, i might prefer to finish it now because i won't be free later on and they aren't done yet, so i'm forced to wait and the other way round, other people might .. you might find them good when dealing with them in person but once you get to work with them in a team, there's another side of whatever characters.
some people are very bossy at work wanting to perfect everything, whatever i mean, not just that.
so, i prefer working on my own, doing whatever i want, and that's it.
not really, but i mean .. i mean i don't have a role model but i can like a trait in someone or so.
for example, you could be doing whatever thing that i like that about you, so i like that, but that doesn't necessarily mean that i take you as a role model. do you get me?
no, it's possible.
it's not necessary .. i can talk to anyone, anyone can tell me anything, it's totally okay. i have no problem at all.
but to discuss something with someone, not just general talk, that requires time.
i don't feel that it's difficult .. but i ((i'm cautious with my words)) .
for example i could .. i try to limit my use of english, i try to express myself more in arabic.
and things like that .. i don't feel that it's difficult but ((i'm very cautious with my words)) .
that i don't care.
i've become more of such, if something happens, i don't care, i used to care before, that's all.
that he lies.
people who lie get on my nerves, they really annoy me, and so do those who ((change facts)) .
one more thing, but it's not .. i don't deal with it, if someone's stingy, i don't like those people.
i feel like they're stingy in all aspects, not just with money
and those who actually for instance .. actually, for me, for instance, if i ask .. i mean, stinginess, but not in money, for instance if i ask you about something that you know and you say you don't know or you don't remember that's .. that's .. that's stinginess for me, do you get me?
so i hate both, lying and stinginess
when what i had plans for and had many things depend on, doesn't work out.
i get really stressed, but then i take my time, i take my time a bit when stressed, then i start to plan again, put a backup plan, but after i am totally done with stress.
no, absolutely, i cannot fabricate at all.
so actually i used to have this problem in whatever exam, that everybody can write anything related to the lectures just to pass the exam, but for me, if i don't know the answer, i will not write anything.
previously, i could've said an explicit no, but now, okay so we use it most of the time but as long as i can communicate with certain people without it, that's it.
but i don't think this is now possible
now .. it makes life easier
i choose anything and convince you of with?
what's the difficult question?
i became nervous.
i will tell you.
i can convince you that iphone is better than samsung.
iphone is water resistance, like samsung, samsung is also water resistant, but i think iphone is more durable and it's dust resistant
it's easy to use and anyone can learn how to use it easily.
you don't get lost in it, like samsung.
i had several points in mind but i forget them now.
what else?
games that are downloaded on it are faster because of the software.
even pubgy is faster on it than .. than samsung.
try them, really, try using both of them, you'll feel that the .. the .. the graphics there are better and it's faster.
and it also retains its value when you sell it.
and it looks better.
i don't mean this, but it's okay. what else?
what else?
very well
okay, i was born in egypt, in cairo.
i was in a language school.
it was privately owned, had nothing to do with the government.
they followed the syllabus placed by the ministry
except for the extra material of the english a-level for instance, in which it used its own syllabus, otherwise it followed the syllabus provided by the ministry which was in english
okay  after that the university was  the university ..
it was a public university.
the program that i joined was engineering, it was actually telecommunications and electronics.
i knew i wanted to join engineering since i was at school.
what i actually wanted to join was computer engineering but i joined a program that's relatively new.
it was supposed to be hybrid between telecom and computer engineering.
and i joined it just as a trial, actually.
it was new and things were modified, it wasn't as expected.
so after that, i decided to shift into more computer engineering or computer science so i started doing my masters after i was done with my bachelor’s degree and my masters was in computer engineering slash science.
okay, the bachelor project was related to interfacing with the cell phone network.
so that in the end, i create an application similar to smart home.
the smart phone had some devices, these devices can be on or off
and the controlling and monitoring of the devices were done through sms.
the masters is still on going, something that has to do with real time applications of networks.
i don't know whether you know these things or not.
i usually get up, make coffee, have breakfast
i usually watch something while having breakfast
and then, i don't know, i shower, get dressed, and go out.
that's it
when there's time, i either play online games , sometimes i watch documentary movies,  sports, sometimes, but not always, sometimes  i learn things, online courses
that's about it
i would say probably marital arts or tennis.
yes, a lot
usually it's a mix
in my case, i don't usually listen to something in specific, i usually listen to different things.
the library .. my music library is diverse more than usual.
ranging from mongolian throat singing to sound tracks, to spanish animation films
i listen to songs in i think eight or nine different languages.
i don't usually understand them, but it's .. i like it, it's fun
so there's nothing in specific, i can't .. i can't name a specific genre that i love listening to.
okay  the last movie that i've watched was a film that has to do with superheroes
it was about a a character that met versions of himself that came from other universes  because of some experiment that was conducted that resulted in all dimensions being linked together, so he met several versions
and there was a version that came from a universe where life was in black and white only.
there was another version that was actually a cartoon animal
there was another version that  was different than him in every aspect.
it was .. it was fun.
it's a relatively new film
it was animated.
yes.
i usually read in the languages that i actually know, arabic or english, i have no preferences towards arabic or english, i read both
i used to read more novels before. now, i'm more in to books that discuss some facts about history, economy or psychology or whatever.
that's what i basically read these days
research and development in any company that manufactures medical devices
i once had an internship or i had a full-time or part-time job in another place.
okay i worked as a part-time teaching and research assistant at another university and i was actually doing several courses at the same time including courses that i hadn't taken before actually as a student, so i had to learn like the students and then act as the teaching assistant.
and besides that, there was actually a part related to research.
the research was in the field of computer vision.
i would say that my life is currently kind of a hybrid between life of a full-time employee and life of a student because i am still a graduate student as i am still completing my masters.
i am still constrained to a great extent by the academic calendar.
the freedom here is not good enough but i like it.
i would say that this is better than having each on its own.
yes
if we're talking about traveling abroad, then i have traveled abroad with my family more than once.
i have traveled abroad alone more than once.
some of these vacations were either research stay or semester abroad for work.
i would say the place i loved the most, if we're talking about countries, it's probably spain, if we're talking about city, it's probably barcelona
i want to go there again because  i think this is my favorite city
that's about it.
probably yes if somewhere in europe.
if north america or canada, i will probably take some time to consider
i prefer more the living environment in europe.
over the past two years, i have stayed in germany i think a duration that is about ten months
and i have stayed in multiple cities
it was actually enjoyable, nothing annoyed me there.
i think i prefer the european lifestyle over the egyptian for many reasons that i can't mention right now.
but i would say that if this offer is available, i will probably take it.
in the neighborhood of akihabara in japan
why? because it has to do a lot with anime and manga and i'm a really big fan
i went to luxor and aswan with my family some years ago and actually what i really liked is the huge amount of history that we are relatively disconnected from while being in cairo
for the experience itself that i visited an old temple where there's no technology the same way it was in the past. i think that this experience introduced a new thing . this is especially nice and not so many countries do like that and talk about a thousand-year history.
another thing would be the trips that you can take with your friends where you can go to dahab or sharm el sheikh or so
i mean the environment differs from the environment of the big city.
the activities that you do there are different, probably more related to the .. the nature of the place whether it has to do with mountains or sea or whatever, far from noise, traffic jam, cars and car horns all day long
so i would say that these are the top two things i would want to do if i travel internally in egypt
i think it was when i knew that i can join my faculty, when i actually got my scores in high school, and joined, i felt like okay, now i'm officially an engineer to be, i think that from this point onwards, everything came as a consequence to this, so i think this was a turning point
i don't know.
i like to think that throughout my life, i had the mindset of an engineer, as i was influenced by my father, my father is an engineer , computer engineer to be in exact.
i don't think that it affected me, but i'm guessing that the skills that i've learned developed me somehow that it changed my personality, it could be in a secondary or indirect way, but i don't believe it has affected me directly
usually on my own, i have worked on my graduation project on my own.
i hate working in teams.
could it be a family member?
i think my grandfather, because his biography is very interesting.
because he started from very humble origins and he ended up, even though his environment had no academic background nor even related to work as he comes from the village not the city, yet he was able to eventually join the faculty of engineering and become a mechanical engineer
and he ended up working in multiple countries.
by the end of his life, i think he spoke two languages other than arabic,  and he spoke them well enough that he could actually teach other people
and at the same time, he made connections with people, work connections i mean, in multiple countries, including germany.
and i think in the very end of his career, because his job was strongly related to the government, so the position he held was relatively high, and he was honored by several presidents at that time
he was actually honored by all presidents in multiple areas
and all these badges, medals and all were displayed at home
so i think this is a good role model
to quote one of my favorite fictional characters is it too much to ask for both?
i would say whatever gives the best end result
if they are here to learn, then love or respect will lead to more learning, so i would say i would go with more learning if they respect me more, so for instance if they are more likely to understand what i'm saying, then okay just respect me and that's it
i don't .. i don't have a specific preference.
i think whatever it is that is actually more beneficial for them
i don't think that i need ice breaking that much.
i think once we started talking, we and keep talking and that's it.
no problem actually
not .. not the type who .. who waits for something to break the ice, i mean, once i start talking with someone, once we reach this point where we're talking, that's it that's fine.
the problem is usually in the stage before we start talking, whether we should talk or not, this could require a push.
i am not a talkative person, i usually don't talk unless somebody addresses me, but once we start talking, everything following that will be okay.
i might need to change my way yes
usually if i know the rules, then i know what i'm doing
if i'm dealing with a social level where i don't know the rules, where i don't know what is considered right in a certain context, and what is considered wrong in another context, i become more reserved to avoid doing anything wrong
that a person is self-aware.
that a person should know why he thinks the way he thinks and why he feels how he feels, or that he can actually identify how he thinks, his biases and preferences.
people who believe that everyone thinks like them, that he is not .. not aware that he's different from other people and that he has something that distinguishes him
i think this happened before but i don't think that it happened a lot.
i believe based on my environment and based on the nature of what i mostly do, there's normally high likelihood that i code switch in the middle and switch from arabic to english and from english to arabic
i mostly watch and listen to things in english.
teaching at our university is supposed to be in english.
so for me, i have no problem to switch from arabic to english, i don't believe that this is restricted to certain situations  or actually i haven't tried observing myself and checking when this exactly happens, but most probably if i just let myself be, without forcing it, i will fill find that i mix between arabic and english evenly.
i choose anything and convince you of it
okay what could it be?
okay.
i can convince you to minimize all the energy you consume, all the plastic you consume, all the paper you consume unnecessarily, this actually helps the environment
okay  one of the things we all know about plastic is that it's not very biodegradable, only some special types of plastic are biodegradable, the rest aren't.
most of the things found in nature are biodegradable, so they end up going in the cycle with all the living creatures
if it's biodegradable, the bacteria eats it then another living organism eats the bacteria and this living organism will be eaten by another living organism bigger than the previous one and so on, and so the whole ecosystem works accordingly with the exception of the non-biodegradable stuff like glass, plastic and metals, their wastes end up as is
even if we throw them away, the only solution to get rid of it is either by burning it or throwing it in the sea, there are no other easy ways to get rid of it
burning it increases the emission of greenhouse gases, which eventually leads to more heating effect, we get climate change, we get melting polar ice caps and the sea level rises and some polar animals lose their homes
it's not a good thing
when plastic is thrown in water, it actually interacts with fish, with marine, with marine life in general
there are many cases where such things ended up killing a living organism for .. for unknown reasons.
there's the example of tortoises that swallow plastic bags thinking that they are jelly fish, as this is what they feed on, and they cannot differentiate between both, so they die
there are cases where the bottle caps get stuck in the dolphin's mouth, disabling it to eat, so again it dies
there are so many of such cases, so it's not really good
eventually, if you don't care about animals, you might care about your own health, because when fish eat plastic, it remains inside their bodies and you actually eat it when you eat the fish
so, this is not good.
micro plastics are also bad for people as they interfere with their biology
so let's say if you're interested in a better life, part of living a better life is living in a better environment, which means that if something has a negative effects on the environment, then it's not in your best interest eventually
humans are selfish.
that's okay.
no problem.
what can actually convince you to do something or not, is how much is directly affects you
every amount of energy that burn unnecessarily or waste unnecessarily, can indirectly cause the price of petrol to increase, which means that your life will be more difficult because the price of everything will increase
all the produced emissions will not allow you to breathe pure air, will lead the environment to be in a worse state in the future than it is right now, this is not for the best of your interest, nor your children's, if you decide to have children, let's say that it's not in your best interest eventually
are you convinced?
i am from abbassia. i was born in cairo.
i was in a national school until second preparatory, starting from third preparatory, i moved to the international department at the same school, i was in ig, the teaching language was english and i used to study french but i don't remember it anymore
i've always thought that computer offers good job opportunities
i am in met, cs, engineering.
i .. i was decided about computer since i was very young, and when i grew up and realized it requires some rational thinking and computation and .. and ((to think in a structured manner)) and .. and high iq, i loved computer even more
at college, our study is more focused in software than hardware
in the first year, like any other engineering college, we studied maths, circuits and .. and physics in addition to all engineering subjects, then after we declared majors, we started focusing more on computer.
we studied web and software engineering and many topics related to software and some related to hardware as well, including embedded systems and computer organization and many other things
my bachelor project that i am currently working on is entitled in-class aid.
it's an application that doctors and students use during the lecture that allows students to send their questions to their lecturer who can then answer them directly, i mean, without using the application.
they can evaluate whether they understand or not, and based on that, he might repeat the lecture, repeat part of it, or clarify a point that he that he hasn't explained before.
honestly, my day starts a bit late nowadays because of the bachelor, i get up late at 11, 12 or 1 and i start my day, i have breakfast then i go over the tasks that i need to do this week for the bachelor project.
and .. and after that, i hang out with my friends till late night, then i come back watch some movies or so, and that's it, and repeat that again.
except for 2 days per week when i meet with the professor, i get up early, i have everything prepared, and honestly, i don't study after that, i just waste the day, and there's another day where i teach a computer course at the university, so also this day gets wasted.
okay so is your weekend different from the other days? do you have any particular plans for the weekend? do you do anything different?
during the weekend, i mainly go out, and i may work for a short time in the morning
on friday, for instance, i might do some tasks at night, not in the morning, because mornings are wasted, so are nights.
thursday night is wasted, so is saturday, i feel cranky as i haven't worked for two days, still not in the mood, but i try to ((get things done)) on sunday, so it doesn't get wasted.
honestly, i really love sports, i'm not into arts and .. and songs, and music and so, but i used to be part of the school's handball team and i used to play ping pong for seven years.
at el-zohour club
and now i'm learning volleyball lightly, and .. and i'm learning it with my friends, i mean, not in professional training.
yes, sure
i used to like rock music so the .. i used to love metal very much, so for a while i listened to nothing but metal music.
then, i switched to light rock, like imagine dragons and their famous songs like radioactive and demons and so on.
and then lately, i started going for trendy songs like those for ahmed kamel and .. and .. i honestly don't know a lot of names, but i listen to them.
yes, absolutely.
frankly, my favorite movies are marvel .. marvel avengers movies and all these things.
i love all these movies very much, but i don't know how many seasons were produced.
starting from iron man till .. from iron man and captain america until avengers, and end game will be released in a month or so.
but the movie i honestly didn't imagine how great it would be, was the last one, which was infinity war.
because i .. i entered it .. because i am really obsessed with these movies, i go watch it in the cinema once it's released.
so, i wasn't expecting people to die at the end at all.
like any superhero in any movie, they keep fighting each other and so and i love watching this, and then they finally win.
i didn't expect at all that in the end they would lose the battle and people would die.
it was ((really tough)) .
so of course i was taken by surprise, we all stayed seated, it was the first it was showed in egypt, we all stayed seated and we didn't move.
even after .. after the movie ended, nothing else will happen, we stayed seated, worried about them.
and all the audience, they were all like me, they love cinema and so.
okay have you had a part-time or full-time job before or attended internships during college? can you tell us more?
i previously worked in photography at a .. a tourism company.
and  i stayed two years with them and i still go on trips with them during summer.
and i work as a teaching assistant at the university here for year one management, i teach them computer, and i teach that.
each has its own pros and cons, of course, but i believe working life is better.
although working at university offers more freedom and i don't have a lot of responsibilities, i need to work in the morning, to prepare for lectures, listen to people and .. and perform some tasks in the morning, and when i arrive home at night, i have to study for the next day or for the exam or if .. i mean, i'm always overloaded.
as much as i don't have many responsibilities, but i'm always working, i believe that is different than working life, which while might be more stressful and more psychologically challenging, but to some extent, i believe i would have working hours, after which i rest and can decide to not work, and .. and that would be normal.
i have been to china once.
i went to a city called guangzhou in china. it's more of an industrial city than a touristic one.
i was .. we were participating in a handball championship, i was a left-winger, so we were playing .. playing against another team there and we spent a week there having fun.
i did bungee jumping, that is i jumped from a mountain, it was fictional
so the .. generally speaking, the city was beautiful, there was a mall there, it was called technology mall or the arabs name it so, at that time, selfie sticks and power banks and things of the like, weren't yet available in egypt, you would find the same selfie stick that is sold here for x you'll find it there for 10 x.
so i mean, of course, we had fun there.
no, i will travel.
why? because life there is definitely easier and salaries are better, even if i decide to get come back eventually, working abroad will give me an edge in my home country.
yeah, of course, after general secondary
to be responsible for choosing university and to be responsible for entering a new community with new people that we don't know, to start building relations from scratch, that's a big deal.
even when it comes to my personal life, my decisions and principals are no longer the same especially when it comes to meeting new people that don't know my principals, don't know my character, so ((i create their perception about me)), people won't blame me for changing who i am.
no, i mean, at that time, i created my own image and i followed it, thank god.
no, in teams.
we can support one another in teams, not only in the aspects that we failed to understand but also at work as i may have some tasks to do outside university or i may feel down that i can't work so my friends will support me and so on.
and the opposite is also true, i would also support, not just to return favors, i mean, it's all about friendship and support.
of course, i have a role model, in our professional life, if we mention our faculty dean, for example, he's well-known all over the world, if i can achieve half or a quarter of what he's achieved in the .. in his career, that would be great
at me club, for instance, our coach participated in many global championships, and he's very experienced in the .. in his field.
i think i'd rather be liked because if people .. respect me but don't love me, that would be fake, but if they really like me and they treat me well, then respect might follow, but to be respected and not liked, this is pretending
opinions may differ but my morals and the way i treat people should not change, for better or worse, if i like the person on not, i should treat them well .. with love and acceptance, without any rejection.
and if someone doesn't want to deal with me, despite my polite and kind manner, then be it, i did my part.
no, to some extent, i'm easy to talk to
okay and when dealing with people of a different social level, do you feel that you're not comfortable and that you need to change your way to make it easier?
generally speaking, you should treat people in a simple way until the person proves that he is brilliant and so we have to rise to this level, otherwise, in the very base, the way we deal must be based on respectful, simplicity and love, and if it is proven that we can develop a stronger relationship, then we can do that, and talk and so
i would say offending somebody or offending with words .. offense in general
being overloaded maybe, when i am busy doing a lot of things, in case of studying, i might not get stressed.
((but if everything is crowded,)) study, home, work, then i may feel stressed
if i feel this way, i should sit alone and start collecting my thoughts and making a plan to find a solution for everything.
once i put a plan and put a timetable for every day to fix this and study this for the exam, ((things settle down)) .
yes, definitely a lot.
many times, because we had a lot of projects at the university, so we used to choose the same team in all team projects and divide the projects on us, such that each one works on a project, we don't all work on all projects.
in the end, we finalize the project before the evaluation and .. and then during evaluation, i have to mention everything that i know, because i obviously haven't worked on it, so i have to show that i've worked on anything.
so i go and explain what we did in that session, he wasn't even asking about it, but i have then answered, so when i get stuck later on, i have already answered, should i have taken care of everything? and so on
honestly, it depends on the person, some people want to believe that and so they do, others don't want to believe that ((so we keep debating)) on whether i have worked on it or not, till one convinces the other
nowadays, i don't think so.
the mobile is no longer a tool, using the mobile is not necessarily good or bad, because you have everything on your mobile, from calling your friends, to knowing their news, knowing their birthdays, checking the news, playing games, working on projects, sending emails, everything is now done through the mobile
i can convince you to play sports
because i don't believe that, no matter how occupied your time is, that sport is not beneficial or a wast of time.
of course if it's excessive, it will be harmful because it will waste time, but sports on it owns definitely benefits the body and keeps you energized
and even if you say that it wastes study time, i can tell you that if you spend the whole day studying, you might be less productive than if you study for a while, play sports for two hours then continue studying, you will find yourself getting a lot done before and after sports
okay i am , my school is a national french one, and i'm egyptian français.
what else?
yes, i was born in cairo yes.
okay joined engineering, not because i love it, it's a plan b for me, as i have other goals, but given that we live in a world where one needs to have a guaranteed plan, so i joined engineering, i got the required grades for it, so i entered it, that's it
okay my plan a is to work as an actor slash director actually.
but of course, this is never guaranteed and it's not easy at all, and i realized that, soi needed a plan b to have this degree.
and until i'm done with college, i should attend workshops to to develop my talent to reach my target, so this is what i'm doing, that's all.
i talked to elder people, i've also talked to people .. people in the field, they're not famous, but they're studying this field.
i understood that it's not a promising field in egypt because it is based on recommendations.
and this recommendation approach is not .. is not nice
they rarely select people according to their talent.
so i won't stop development and learning in this area, but i am doing it along with university.
as long as i have enough time to do this, it doesn't require years of studying like engineering for instance.
i mean, just like if i want to be a musician, i still need to practice every day of course, but i mean, some people reach their goals without studying it.
like many actors yehia .. yehia elfakharany is a doctor.
many had their own plan b.
90 percent my decision would be met but i am still not sure, but why? because i love game development.
i hope to join dmet and game development requires some creativity, when it comes to creativity, i love such things, i know that it will involve coding, but of course, for me, it's mainly game development so i can employ my creativity.
so this is close to acting, i mean, the idea of arts is important for me, so engineering will link me to it in that sense.
okay  okay once i wake up, i check my mobile, of course the alarm rings like ten times for example, so thank you for whoever invented the snooze option.
after i get up, i check my mobile.
and sometime, sometimes, if i .. if i have the energy, i will do push-ups.
after that  i start getting ready for college, and so on, and of course, i leave just on time and arrive just on time.
i watch .. as plans .. i always like watching scenes from movies that i like, and i spend a week memorizing this role and .. and performing it in front of the mirror and i might also film it on my own
and i already attend the acting workshop in the weekend, so yes, these are my plans, this is my plan b .. my plan a that of acting.
yes, of course, i love listening to songs.
i prefer listening to english songs definitely, not definitely, but yes i love listening to english songs.
and my favorite singers are calum scott and sam smith because they have nice voices and their songs are nice.
not that much, no.
my preference of english over arabic goes back to when i was young, so why did i choose this language?
i don't know .. i feel that .. i feel more connected to the story when reading it in english
one of my favorite movies is the theory of everything which shows the biography of stephen hawking
first of all, the actor eddie redmayne, he deserved the oscars for it, he took the oscars, his performance was great.
the biography of stephen hawking influences you as there are a lot of emotions in this movie, it's drama and romance because as it showed his story not only with physics and his illness, but also with his wife.
so it was .. i mean it was .. it was really .. the directing was great and the songs sorry .. the music was really touching and moves one's emotions, that's it, so it's a legendary movie.
i haven't really thought of this before, but i wish to travel abroad, i want my children to learn abroad.
i was in français school and i believe that français .. français is a strong language, but now the world is focusing on english more.
the industry is mainly english speaking so i want to teach my children to be able to manage achieving their goals with their fluency in english.
of course if at any point .. i will always give them the freedom, after they finish primary school for instance, they will have opportunities to switch from english to français, if they wish
i won't .. i won't have full control but of course my preference would be for english.
besides acting of course, which is number one, my second dream job is to be an animator
in the .. in the part of the .. of the .. the arts, i usually go for arts.
and animation, just like i went for game development in engineering, through it, i wanted to download programs and self-study animation because this .. this industry is very promising abroad.
secondly, the idea that one can express himself through a movie, with animation, with characters, to create these characters, for me, is amazing, so it was my dream job, it's a dream job, more than a dream  is to work at pixar.
but this is one of my dream jobs actually.
no, i haven't tried this.
i can't really say, but based on what many people say, student life is better, not only based on what people say, but it is a fact, student life is better because this is when i build my character plus my future
this is when i get to decide what i will do, so i believe this is the most important stage in life.
yes, i have traveled.
okay, i have traveled to france and swiss and .. and passed by italy and germany where i spend two nights at a hotel.
for me, switzerland was one of the best countries, honestly.
first of all, it's .. it's a calm country. i believe it's just perfect
the structure of the country, you walk around and you're impressed, there's a lot of nature there, whether i'm going around on foot or by car, i'm always impressed
people there are nice, my uncle is living there actually so he .. he always shows me around.
during my two-day trip in germany, i went to europa-park, that was the biggest place for roller coasters in the world, it was really adventurous, i also had the chance to travel a bit around germany, around europa-park, it wasn't enough to discover their culture, but the place was really nice place.
and spain of course .. i went to spain on a tournament, it wasn't a touristic trip.
america, that is  that is the .. that is the main target  .
why? because most of my dream jobs are there, plus people  .. i mean people .. people there are nice.
some people are nice while the other are not, there are good and bad people in each country, but i mean a lot of my friends are already living there so i won't feel homesick.
we are two communities; the egyptian and american, that are not so different from one another.
of course, the cultures are different .. but i mean that we already blended in there, as an egyptian community, there are a lot of egyptians there, so i won't feel homesick, unlike other countries.
and my main target is that my dream jobs are there.
it depends. if you mean america, i will definitely go for it.
if it's any other country, i will take my time to ask doctors here and think before i make the decision.
i used to have two choices; whether to travel to france or to join guc.
by the end, i joined guc so as not to feel homesick and alone in france.
this is not irritating.
as long as i am an egyptian who get used to the community here, it's difficult to go and live in another place.
so if the job offer is not in america and it's in a different place, i will take time to think about it. if it's in america, i will definitely go for it.
i don't think so but
because i wasn't aware of how things are when i was young, i was always planning to join the institute of the cinema and to be an actor, that was the .. that was my target, no one would stop me, and i wouldn't listen to anyone.
when i followed my father's advice to listen to other people's experiences, i found out that i was going to choose a path that is not guaranteed, so i need to obtain a very good certificate at least, and build my career on it, until i can achieve my dream along the way, but it shouldn't be my plan a.
so this is the turning point.
no, definitely, in teams .. for me, i prefer in teams .. team projects .. i mean, without teamwork, i believe individual is not the best option, but in teams, members can share good ideas, develop a better project compared to one who already did the project on his own.
there are two role models, the first one is my father, whom i see as a great fighter, he .. he's a great role model, and for me, the role model in acting is meryl streep.
see how many nominations for oscars, as her performance in all movies, she always does her best .. she gives her all to produce the best version, and she really knows what .. what it feels like to be an actor.
she knows acting, i mean, what does it mean to be an actor. bottom line, she defines it very well.
i will choose to be respected of course, because i don't want to find myself in a situation where i'm liked because i am a famous youtuber, for example, while, people may insult me in the comments.
i wouldn't .. i wouldn't like this, i would rather be respected.
no, unfortunately, one that is easy to talk to
this is .. this is my personality .. i'm more inclined to silly things
i open up to anyone .. i can talk about any topic and open discussions.
trivialities .. of course
why? because silliness avoids the .. actually i don't know why, but when i was young, people always perceived me as arrogant for instance
so i .. i decided to .. to increase the silliness in my character, from .. from experience, i found it to be really enjoyable, i liked myself more and people liked me more, so it's okay to be silly.
arrogance  i mean  .. i mean .. that
we're all human beings, why should someone treat me with arrogance? that is of course in addition to extreme qualities, such as lying, ((not telling the truth)), not respecting my limits, but for me, i wouldn't want to deal with an arrogant person at all, that's it
well, yes, i have tried this back at school and .. and i have tried this at the club in which i'm a member right now, that of debate .
i wasn't well prepared and they were discussing politics and it was a big issue but i didn't understand anything.
but the .. i mean that .. i am really not interested in politics so when i had to bring up all the names, trying to state facts that people died, and mentioning world war two and .. i tried as much as i can, but in the end, it didn't work
those one who adjudicate should have a poker face, so i can't get any signal from them, but afterwards  i know my mistake, that's all
no, i don't think so
i don't know, it's a habit.
maybe .. maybe i can minimize using it but i can't live without it, because i have placed my whole life in it  i don't know but i really have all my life in it .. i can't remove it all of a sudden
anything, okay
okay, i can tell you that youtube can be the most rewarding job if you're the laziest person on earth
he .. he takes videos of himself, nothing fancy at all, and in the end he earned a thousand and seven hundred dollars in two years.
of course, that is .. that is while staying at home, being lazy and working another job.
so a thousand and seven hundred dollars .. he actually earned more, that video he filmed was a month ago, so he earns money by standing in front of a camera saying nonsense, making fun of himself
okay if it's that easy
and the problem is that .. that there are no limits.
anybody can subscribe to a million people, it doesn't matter, youtube will pay.
anybody can create a channel. anybody can say nonsense to attract subscribers that will increase sooner or later. we believe that we usually go for trivialities.
we make a trend out of anything
this is what happened many times before on social media.
you can easily earn money, so if you want .. if you want to be lazy and earn money, be a youtuber.
okay, i live in 6th of october, i used to go to an international school, we studied french, english, spanish and arabic.
okay, i joined applied arts
i made this decision one or two years earlier because i'm into creative things and so and i can't imagine doing anything else.
currently, graphic design and media.
in graphic design, we make posters and things for advertising and so on, media is more into movies, videography, editing, and so on
in our final exam last semester, for example, we made a film, short film.
we're designing many posters this semester in graphic .
okay, because i live away, on the days where i go to college, i don't do anything else, only if i have to finish some tasks for the following day, but in a typical day, i would wake up, go to college, come back and sleep.
for weekends, it depends, i usually stay at home in the morning, and i can go out do some activities at night.
i love drawing and taking photos, and in general, i enjoy all what i'm doing at the university.
yes, i like listening to songs, most of them are, actually, they're fifty fifty english and arabic, but mainly arabic i guess
cairokee, for example
okay   a movie, could be, twelve years .. twelve .. twelve years of slave
i really liked this movie because the topic was nice and interesting.
it was about his biography and how he was living
yes, i gave this a thought, i'd say international, and learn french as a main language like i did, because those who learn french usually speak many languages and their system is better.
okay, when i was young, i don't recall that at all, but now, i don't have a dream job, but i am interested to work in a fields that involves creativity, i would enjoy that, but i don't have a dream job.
no, nothing
okay i took photos of my brother's class in the graduation ceremony,  i took two photos, and i printed them and .. and that's all.
i think i will be more happy while working because .. because i will have better experience and so on and .. and the job nature will be better, i think so.
yes
i've once been to when i was young, and i've been to america two times a couple of years ago.
i had great time there, but i don't want to go there again.
yes, i want to visit so many countries, i want to visit so many places, for example, i want to go to india.
because i find their culture interesting, so and i want to discover it.
no, i would agree because i love traveling and i want to .. i want to try that experience of living alone.
so, i have recently been to alexandria, and i have never been there before, so i really enjoyed my time there, it's a nice place and even the streets, i liked it, it's very different than cairo.
yes, i visited many places, i visited the citadel, the library and the palace of jewels.
okay, last summer, i went for many trips with my friends from the church, before that, i didn't really have a social life but after this trip, everything changed, when i made friends from the church, i even started making friends at university, so this made a big difference.
yes definitely, it allowed me to be more outgoing in life, and have more activities.
in terms of experiences, i got to know more people, so i started doing more activities, for example, i didn't use to hang out at late times, but now i started to live more freely without taking permission from my parents to go out, i mean i grew older.
it definitely depends on the project and depends even more on the people, i would love to work with with my friends for sure.
but at the same time, i also like working individually to be more in control, and it's in my character that i love to be in control in my projects, i become so involved in it.
so this makes it a bit hard on me to work with someone, but if it's a team that i get along with, i enjoy that.
in general, at work or so, there are a lot of people that i get to see, or those i follow on the internet who have jobs that i really want to have .. and i think of how they've worked so hard to reach this level and how i can reach this that?
i consider those people my role models at work.
liked, i believe, because if people like you, that would be better than ..
respect, yes it's really important, but .. but .. but what?
i forgot the question.
let me collect my thoughts.
okay but .. respect is important, but at the same time respect only, i mean, you can be lonely and .. and people still respect you but you're not happy
i think people get this impression about me that i'm not easy to talk to or so, but when i start talking, we get along quickly.
of course, i should change my way according to who i'm addressing and so on.
i will definitely change my language when talking to people from a different social level, a lower one for instance. i will choose different words for sure, as well as different topics, unlike when i'm addressing someone from the university community.
the words will mostly differ, as well as the topics, the way, the language, everything.
a trait? it could be the creative part, so i'd break the work routine
i like to have this sense for adventures, instead of being dull
in general, people who are hyperactive, not in general, but in an annoying way
i .. i can't really explain this but .. but there are some specific people. i'm thinking of examples while talking, people who are constantly noisy and they can't stop that nor do they get it when i try to calm them down, i hate this in people.
i am probably too lazy to do anything in life, especially the small things, when people request me to do things, i find it very hard to leave the couch.
this is the what .. they consider this disobedience but for me it's laziness.
okay, yes, there are many things that people might find exciting, but i don't, grades for instance, grades never made me happy, grades can upset me, but i don't think it is that important to me that it can bring me happiness, there are many things as such.
yes, always, in any presentation i speak in a sophisticated way so that people would believe that i understand everything even if i don't understand anything.
we had an exercise in one of the courses that we should give a presentation on a topic that we don't understand or on a topic that is assigned on spot and we present at once.
at that time, i didn't do it back then honestly, but i thought, what i do?
no, i would speak in a sophisticated way and i would try to direct the conversation to a topic that neither of us understand, so i can fabricate as i wish  .
no, people believe me when  .. when i pretend to understand everything, people believe that i understand.
actually no, because the simplest and most common example is that i don't know the way without the mobile.
besides that, communication, not in the sense of social media which isn't really important to me but mainly the functional things like talking and .. and maps and things like that.
okay, many people say that  life used to be better than now and so on and that our generation is corrupted and so on.
i don't really know why old people are annoyed from the behavior of people, even though it's clear than people had the same issues for the past hundred years, same problems, it's all the same, everything is the same, just with different times, people are just being nostalgic and believe their days were better.
no, the present and past are the same.
i was in a school in maadi.
the languages there were english and french as a second language.
i studied deutsch when i joined university
i play basket, i used to play basketball when i was young until first year of college, like all my life, and now i play crossfit.
i joined computer engineering because this major at my university is good and i have the passion for it since i was young, i like applications and games, i believed that technology is growing and that this career has many doors and opportunities.
i am learning a lot of things, including how to develop web applications, how to develop mobile applications, how to develop games .. as well as hardware things such as embedded systems
my bachelor project mostly
now, i wanted to make a unity simulation that simulate the real car in egypt.  it will drive like how the egyptian drives.
of course it's well known that it's very beautiful.
there's also machine learning, neural networks and deep learning.
basically, these days i get up and either go to work or, because i work part-time, whether on the other days, i wake up, have breakfast, work for some time on my bachelor project, workout, come back continue working, and i'm following series that i enjoy watching.
the series that i am watching, i won't mention its name, but
okay okay, game of thrones
good  nice
the .. the details are great in the series.
for the characters, you have some sight, deep into his character, not .. not .. not a superficial relationship.
and i love details, so i appreciated this in this series.
yes
i prefer english, more, i also like arabic, but mostly english.
i love english singers like adele and sia.
that's as far as i can remember, and for arabic, i like amr diab, i like mounir, i like hamo beka.
no
basically, crossfit is about working out a lot everyday, you grow a lot of skills as during training, such as weight lifting for example, you grow in breathing and running.
to grow a lot of things as in the end of the competition, the main target is to have a good shape and so on.
the second target of taking part in the competition is to win because this is very good.
an actor
not yet, because of college, i cannot approach them in parallel
life is harder when i'm working because .. because ..
finding friends at work is hard because not everyone wants the best for you
you feel people are competitive in a bad way, at the university you feel like these are your colleagues so you try to get along and be on good terms with one another, this is my point of view, with my friends at the university.
yes
when you travel to europe, you can visit many places. our university enable us in a way or another to travel to europe.
so one of the places that i visited was paris and it's one of the places where i didn't stay for a long time but wanted to, it's not the most organized country in the world, nor the cleanest country, but it has a unique spirit.
that is when talking about cities, when it comes to nature, i would say switzerland but i wish i had stayed there time to discover it more.
do you mean in general .. as friends .. who traveled with me or you mean people that i met there?
no, i didn't make any friends there because i always traveled with egyptians, so i didn't really have the opportunity to meet new people
outside egypt?
i would like to visit .. also one of the places that i really want to visit is rome and i want to visit america, as it will be a new and interesting experience for me.
on the top of the list would be my parent, because i don't want to travel abroad for a long time because you'll be committed to something abroad, you will stay there for a while so you have to be well aware of that while making the decision.
but .. but also being alone is not a nice thing, traveling and leaving your friends and family behind is not the best thing in the world.
no
i used to travel when i was playing in a well-known team, we used to go to alexandria, that was really amazing.
we used to travel to alexandria to play for six days, we would play a match every day, that was really amazing, i used to hang out with my friends, that was i think the first time for me to travel to alexandria, so it was an experience to to see the sea and all of that
that i used to be very fat, like very, but i took .. i made a decision when i was thirteen years old, i was still young, that i must lose weight, and i also has back issues.
the problem is still there but not as much as it used to be. i didn't have a straight back because my shoulders are not of the same height.
so i made the decision that i must lose weight and that encouraged me to restart my life in general and sports
yes, very much because once i made a plan and follow it, i will be able to achieve whatever i want. this makes me feel that i can do anything.
as i told you before, i wouldn't have had the friends i have right now, the teams i was involved in, i don't think i would have joined the same university, a lot of things would have been different.
respected, it's not necessary that people like everything you do, but yet there must be respect, this is the most important thing.
if somebody respects you, at least he will respect your decisions, he might not like them, nor does he have to like your character but he respects your decisions.
i prefer working in teams as partners may draw each other's attention to details that they miss, we discuss things together, this makes things easier and nicer
i would say my brother, my elder brother, i have two elder brothers. my elder brother has always been my role model because he achieved his targets independently.
it takes two minutes exactly, but it also depends on whether i give this opening or not, if the person is not comfortable, it won't happen ((no matter how much he tries)), but if i feel that there's chemistry between us and i felt that he's a good person, i will go for it at once, that i interact and joking immediately.
no, because .. well it could be, it's smart to know how to approach and deal with different people.
you should adapt yourself to get along with people, they shouldn't adapt themselves to get along with you.
same thing happened at university, but in a higher level because you need to know how to approach and how to interact with all these people.
you don't face difficulties, but it might be a bit strange in the beginning, then you learn how to break the ice and get along
i always fight for what i want no matter how hard it is, i never give up, not until i completely lose all hope, but this happens after a long time, thank god.
that a person never believes that he might be mistaken, i always thinks he's right, he understands everything, and no one else does
yes, maybe .. no, i don't know .. no, no .. most probably
yes i can give someone several chances, if i care about our relationship, i don't mean being a relationship with a girl, i am talking about relationships between people in general, i believe that no matter what, you shouldn't go back to being strangers.
i keep holding on to it and i give many second chances, so that's it, someone might find this strange
if i am unable to be productive, it becomes very stressful, that i can't reach what i want.
i am trying focusing on my result as a some sort of motivation to keep me going .. even if it's really small, but i need to be sure that i can be productive, no, there's something wrong, for sure, i can reach my goal by taking many steps.
no, it could be an interview .. and the interviewer is talking about things you don't know, and is asking you questions, so in order to make him feel like you understand a portion of what he's saying at least, you say complicated stuff, you use complicated terms in the computer for instance so that he thinks that you understand so, that's it, so both of you are happy and deceiving each other.
as i have told you, to deceive one another, he knows quite well that we doesn't understand, so we both don't understand, so he'll be laughing and happy.
no, i can't .. for many reasons such as photography. i love taking photos. i always like to stay connected so that anybody can reach me in case something happens. but it will be a bit difficult without the mobile.
don't you feel like it distracts you from more important things in life like being in contact with people, face-to-face
if i am doing nothing in my life except for using my mobile, then you might be right, that it's some sort of big destruction, and we don't pay attention to this, but i think you can manage it.
of course we all fail at this, but at least we are trying.
okay i'll tell you , i will choose the first thing you mentioned, that is traveling.
in general, traveling is very important for many reasons. when you're subjected to a new environment that you have never seen before; you are getting out of your comfort zone, you might get lost often, so this allows your character to be dependent .. independent, not dependent
you know how to handle things on your own, it could be that you can't speak their language at all, so you reach this state where you must learn how to communicate with them
i'll tell you one more thing  try discovering countries  you gain experience in
i can tell you .. what else should i say?
when it comes to traveling, in total, it's a win-win situation because of the experience that you acquire in dealing with people, and that you get to see new aspects that you've never encountered before, so anybody should try it, more than anything else ..
okay, i was .. was living in maadi, i was in a language school, i studied in english.
i was in a national school.
okay, i joined engineering.
honestly, i wasn't interested in engineering, but  i have no idea, i applied for computer science, it turned out to be engineering.
but it's okay, actually. i preferred over many others, but i never thought it would be engineering and that i will spend five years of studying and so on.
but it's okay, actually, i liked it because i was interested to know how computers works and so on, so it's okay actually, i liked it.
okay, as i said, in computer science, we study things related to code, how to develop games and database, and things of the like, nothing in specific
and my bachelor is related to computer vision and image processing.
it's called adaptive pyramid.
this is an implementation by adaptive pyramid.
the idea is that you have an image that you want to progress in a way that the output image is a bit different, that's all, this is the project in general.
okay, i wake up, have breakfast, of course breakfast is the most important thing.
that's it and .. and then  it depends on the day, but usually if i have nothing to do, i watch series
it actually depends, but i usually go for concerts like music world and sound clash and things like that, i really like it, i usually like to go for it in the weekend, otherwise, i have a family day, where i go out with my family, and so on.
yes, i used to play basketball.
i used to like it very much but i quit due to an injury.
yes, i love reading very much.
okay, i love both, arabic and english.
the first book that i read was pride and prejudice by jane austen, and i am really love this book, i really love mr. darcy.
it would be great having people like him
this is book had a great impact on my life.
that's it and there's a book in arabic called a quarter of gram, it's also really nice.
it talks about addiction and how he got treated, those two books were really interesting.
sure
okay, the movie that i liked the most is her.
it was about how technology has become very important in our lives, that someone was extremely depressed and has nobody to understand him and there's no communication between people at all
so he found that his computer is the one talking to him, it understands him, he can speak to it, so he loved it .. so it was .. it was really an amazing movie.
when it comes to songs, i have no specific songs, as i can listen to fayrouz and then listen to rap songs.
for me, it's okay .. i listen to pop most often, this is what i love the most, especially those in english.
i also like arabic but .. not as much as english.
you might also find italian french songs, but only about two songs.
but .. but this is not what i mainly listen to.
yes, it was .. it was also discussed in pride and prejudice, i told you it greatly influenced me, that is first impressions aren't always the best and this is true, you shouldn't decide whether a person is good or bad based on your first encounter.
honestly, this is a tough question because i don't have a specific answer right now even if i decide to go for a career shift, if i don't want to work in computer science, i don't know what i will go for, ((i didn't find myself in a specific field)) .
the course i liked the most was computer graphics and things that are related to gaming a bit. if i decide to work in this field, i will go for that.
by experience, i need to choose a good working place to get along with people as by the end of the day, i won't be working alone.
so at least i know how to get along with people, and deal with them according to their personalities.
i believe this is one of the things i'm paying attention to the most in the internship. actually, if you don't get along with with people, you won't be able to get your work done, you won't find somebody to help you.
actually, at least at some point, we all need somebody to help us.
i should have a good relationship with people and so on, so i actually believe that the social life is very important at work, even more important than competency.
based on the internships that i've done, i believe working environment is better because there's not panic of exams and things like that.
and i get nervous and so, do you get me? and you feel like you still don't know what you want.
you may work and still feel that you're lost but you feel that the working environment is a bit better.
i thought about those issues as well, but i thought at least you have specific working hours and there are some people who are working with you so you won't do anything alone.
so it will be simpler than having a deadline and i may succeed or fail or repeat. do you get me? i think these issues will be more flexible at work.
i may be mistaken actually but this is what i felt and experienced with people working.
yes, i have traveled.
well, i have been to berlin and amsterdam.
i actually loved berlin very much.
although some people found it boring, but i loved life there in general.
i didn't choose a good day to visit it as there were festivals at that time.
so i was surprised but it was enjoyable and nice and that's it.
i prefer to go to berlin as it was the clean city and you feel that people there are little bit more aristocratic.
for me, berlin was really very nice.
yes, i made friends there, when i first went there, i didn't know anybody and then i made friends from university who traveled with me.
from there, not really, but we are still in touch actually.
there are a lot of places but we can say that i liked barcelona the most, i liked it very much actually.
okay, i will definitely need time to make up my mind. definitely, i will be very interested in traveling and trying a new life, but the factors would be my family .. my family and friends and especially my family. i don't prefer being away from them for a very long period of time.
especially that i get homesick quickly.
so yes, those are the factors that will have influence, but still if it would be a specific period of time and i will go back, then yes, maybe .. i would take this step.
yes.
okay, it was in dahab.
we climbed saint catherine mountain. it was really good.
it was very exhausting and i won't repeat it again but it was a good experience to see the view from the top and the activity itself was new for me.
but it was nice
maybe when i joined university.
in general, my life changed especially that i lost many people, and so.
so to start again
i used to have trust issues.
so the idea that i enter university which is a whole new world and that i have to interact with people so i felt that i actually should overcome my fears to be able to deal with people. so i believe this has changed.
i became more confident. i understood that i shouldn't stop making acquaintances when i go through a bad situation.
not all people are the same, i should actually try again.
i prefer working in groups because i don't usually know everything i like to hear other people's opinions, but that is if those people will be working with you.
no one in specific, but successful people in general, i wanted to be like them.
that i should be a hard worker like them and to reach my goal as they did. so, i admire the idea that they managed to reach their goals actually. i see that this is really a good thing in their character that i wish i could do the same.
respected
because not all people will love me, i am sure. not all people will like my personality, so at least they know that .. i mean, they don't have to necessarily love me but rather respect me.
you may not like me but you do respect me.
no, i think it's easy, but they might get the impression from my appearance that i'm not, but once they start talking to me, i believe things become easy.
it's not about changing my way or what i say, but the idea is that i should know .. what to say and what not to say. i can change how i talk according to their social level and how to ((reach them)) such that i don't look arrogant, you get me? nor ((of a lower level)), so no, i should reach a certain level to be able to talk.
okay, that .. when i love somebody, i can actually do anything that he wants.
i don't know what exactly, of course, there are a lot of things most of all would be arrogant people, i hate arrogance, don't treat me with arrogance  i don't like that
yes, i'm such a hard-headed one.
when i should do a certain task, and i have a deadline and i haven't finished finish it yet or i don't know how to get it done, i feel that i am unsuccessful, how come i failed to do this, and so on
i usually go talk to my brother, he knows how to calm me down, so once he calms me down and gives me good advice, to just keep trying and working as much as i can, to do my part and that's it.
yes, i think i did this once and i felt that i looked like an idiot ..
but i don't remember what the topic was, but i kept saying nonsense.
i swear, i was actually rejected after it.
i believe based on the conversation, he didn't believe me but at the time when were together, i felt that  he's okay with what i said but maybe he was pretending just to finish the interview.
i would love to live without a mobile but i think .. i think i won't be able to.
actually, yes, i can delete some applications for a certain period of time, but afterwards i will need them once again to know a specific thing, something like that.
i swear, i'd love to live without a mobile.
it's a silly topic, but because i was recently discussing it, that is early marriage or people who get married before graduating from college
like, seriously, people?
take it step by step, especially that now you're in this state where you don't know what you are going to do at the university. ((your life is still not really clear)), so how can make such a great decision like that.
and that's all so .. but some people believe they are up to the responsibility, okay, that is the case for some, but in general the idea of people getting engaged or married at an early age scares me honestly. i mean, guys, you should really take .. give yourselves the chance to get to know you first so that you can choose who you want to continue your life with.
okay it's bit by bit because ..
you said everything all at once.
i'm from cairo.
i was born in giza but i spent my whole life in cairo at el mokattam.
i was in an international school.
what was the last question you've asked?
the languages that i used to study were arabic, english and deutsch.
okay, i chose media engineering and technology.
when did i choose it? i chose it in .. after semester four
semester two, sorry yes semester two.
i had decided that .. when i was back at school, i wanted to join the .. this university and that i wanted to be majored in media engineering and technology. i loved the computers in general.
so i actually decided that i want to join this university and go for this major, but that was since i was back at school, back when i was young actually not .. not back at school but many years before graduation.
okay what do i study at university? i study computer science, computer science is coding in general, we learned python, java and prolog, and things like that.

okay, it depends. i have certain plans on the weekends, other plans on the other days when i go to university.
if it's a day off, i wake up late, without setting an alarm or anything.
yes .. i get up, have breakfast first thing, this is the most important thing, after that, i make a cup of coffee and open the laptop to check how everything is and check where i had stopped then continue working on it.
then i work for a while until around lunch time and sometimes i go to the gym for example, after working and eating.
but i mean this is my daily routine at .. at home.
when i'm at the university
i have to set my alarm first then i leave home, that is after having breakfast, when i arrive i check everything then i socialize with my friends, and so on, everything is great.
i like listening to both. i used to not like arabic that much but now i love english and arabic.
i like .. can i mention the bands' names? okay
i love listening to, i don't have anything on my mind right now, but let me think for a second ..
yes, there is .. in terms of english these days, allan walker.
and i also love listening to old songs .. let me think for a second, i love listening to nirvana, who else
regarding new songs, let me give you examples for new songs  because there's allan walker, there's .. why did i forget all the names all of a sudden?
i .. don't know .. i'm not a reader, i don't read a lot but i have tried reading before.
what's its name?
i really forgot the names.
yes  the most .. one of the most .. my favorite books i mean .. animal animal farm.
i love it so much.
okay, the story of the movie that influenced me and that i love?
okay, without saying the movie's name?
okay, i mean, is it okay?
okay, the one i really liked the most was released last year which was avengers, i think infinity war was its name.
it was amazing, i was almost .. do you know its story?
thanos decided to destroy half of the planet.
and the avengers want to defend the planet and so.
he was able to collect the stones from them.
and .. and he really managed to kill half of the planet actually.
i can't wait for the new part.
okay, honestly, i really like game development, this is what attracted me the most .. so i like game development the most.
but the problem in egypt is that .. it doesn't work well here so i will have to travel abroad later on.
but as for now actually, while i'm in egypt, i'll probably .. i'll go for web development and so on or maybe .. and maybe applications .. mobile applications as well i mean.
i did an internship at a company in .. it was a company for stocks and so on but they had a small it department so .. so i joined them and they taught me object oriented programming and things like that.
that was after the first year and i joined them again after the second year and they actually enriched my experience in web development and so on.
honestly, when i was a student because i had less responsibilities  i feel that working life will have too much responsibilities and one will really face life actually, that's it.
, no, honestly, no.
i honestly want to visit all europe, any .. any country, it doesn't matter, england, spain, any place, but i want to see different cultures and experience different places, rather than egypt
excuse me, and what was the second question?
the factors that will influence my decision  okay, the most important thing, honestly, is that i don't want to leave my family. this is my main problem in leaving my country, and my belongings of course, and everything, and my friends.
but if i could take them there with me i mean or find and solution, i would be very happy, honestly.
i travel a lot internally in egypt. recently, i was just recently in alexandria actually so  .
i should tell you about alexandria? okay
we started the day by going to .. ((it was a one-day trip)) .
we started the day, went by train, and ate in kind of a local area.
we ate melted cheese with sausages and things like that.
after that we kept took a stroll by the beach of alexandria and after that we did .. we did .. what did we do?
yes, we went there to eat snacks .. somewhere but i can't remember its name. we ate rice with milk with ice cream ((it was a bit messy)) and nuts, but it was really good, honestly.
and after that, we visited the citadel and after that .. after that we went ((to a seafood restaurant)), and it was .. was .. was honestly a very day, then we returned back on the same day, that's it.
a moment that i consider a turning point? okay
just a second, let me think, let me think, let me think.
i would say joining college, my personality changed after joining university. when i was at school, i was more introvert and i wasn't very talkative with people, but after i joined university, i met many people and i became more sociable and i got to know many people and so on.
actually, till now i'm getting to know people. the experience at university is very different. that was actually one of the biggest turning points in my like, i mean, after joining university.
what has changed in my personality is that i became more sociable, more active and more energetic. i love hanging out. i love .. i don't know .. i love life.
i don't know honestly how i can say this.
no, i usually work in teams, i have never worked on my own.
simply, because they say that we can make teams of whatever, so i assume that i can't finalize this project individually. i also like to cooperate with people and have team work and so on, and this is actually a skill required by companies, that you learn how to deal with people and how to work in teams and so on.
honestly, it's my mum, because i really get inspired by her for just one reason that she's really really nice and she's really kind, and how she gets around with people. she's cool, you know.
i don't know how i can say this but
i would rather be respected or liked? just a second .. maybe respected.
maybe respected, for me, i would say respected. ..because maybe someone likes me, but the things i stood for like .. i don't know how to explain it, honestly, i don't know
but for me, i would say respected. i don't know .. i don't know why  but for me, i would actually say respected.
honestly, i am the kind of person who needs some ice breaking, but , i get to know some people easily and other people .. it depends but i need ice breaking with the majority of people.
a little bit, i keep thinking whether i should treat him normally or i should talk to him like i talk to other people of the same social level who i deal with every day, or could he get annoyed annoyed from certain things and situations and so on, so it's a little bit different, i .. keep overthinking to be cautious, for example.
okay, people say that i am pure-hearted, honestly, and i love this about myself, honestly, and that all people agree on this especially those people who know me well, ((this is priceless)) .
i hate people who want you to provide them with information just because they want to keep their database. they just want to keep their information, they want to take information from you and not share anything about themselves.
you know they refer to her as ((rude))  i don't know.
i hate this quality and .. and i also hate those who have hatred towards all people, i don't like those who hate everyone, and ((only concerned about himself)), i don't like this.
exams, university exams
i usually suffer from stress before exams, you know that feeling of i'm freaking out, i'm freaking out. then i try to think about something else, do anything else just to get out of this .. mood. i can listen to music or do anything apart from studying.
okay, i don't know, maybe the interviews of the club, but not work. i can talk in english in the club interviews. i keep saying .. mention programs .. i keep mentioning names of programs that the interviewer doesn't know or understand, just to impress him and get accepted.
no, honestly, i cannot live without my mobile. i won't lie to you, i love my mobile, for me, mobile is my life, have everything on my mobile, i am that kind of person who always likes taking photos.
i love to socialize on whatsapp. i keep holding my mobile all day, using whatsapp, and text my friends. my life is all about my mobile.
i should convince you of something.
honestly, i don't know what to convince you of. let me think.
okay yes, you can travel to space.
there's a certain company now that's interested in traveling to space .. on planet .. on planet mars in 2030. now, they need people to go there. you can participate there, i don't know what to say, honestly.
okay
