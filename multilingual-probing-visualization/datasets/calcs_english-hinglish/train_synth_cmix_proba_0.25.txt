batman banaam superman
the director is zack snyder , 27 % rotten tomatose , 4.9/10 .
not very popular haye seems
but the audiences liked it . iska haye a b cinema score
yes
there is a huge divergence between proffession al critical opinion and regular film goers
i 've naheen seen dekhaa
i jaanata the difference .
i ca n't believe they used ben affleck as batman
so it probably wo shayed get any awards , but should have done well enough at the boxes office
it yeh a vikalp choice
well vaise was made ise 2016
i 'm buss guessing as huun what it may have accomplished back then
probably nothing with una naheen
inn box office gross is more important than critics acceptance for these blockbuster type haye
i mujhe n't like how they made a whole kahani story banaai .
they merey barbad it for me
although critics can affect word of curr to an extent
batman as a billionaire
yeah right !
is n't that what he always was ?
but they make it the main focus .
batman i know , main huun thaa
the lack of intellectual paatron for the main characters was my problem . especially concerning lakes sambandh luther mein
iss you seen this film ?
yes haan haye
what was your aapka part ?
lex l taka sabse was the worse villain ever
you haye ?
this yeh n't a memorable film . it got me through samay mujhe of popcorn at the moment i was watching , , but you forget about it baare after
hahaha
did people know that they were super heroes ?
the best part antim wonder woman action scenes in the final act
i love wonder woman
wonder woman is the right name for her cause i always wonder mein they took so long to get her into the movies
haha

i saw it on dvd but still was fun

i do n't totally trust hain , way give biased reviews
was n't there iss sequel to this film ?
i do n't una trust them either . i never let reviews dekhane me from watching a film .
i think it is best to swayam for yourself
i usually watch a movie if i like the actors
i believe there was an iron man 2 and 3 !
i forgot they jeff bridges was in this cast ! !
vaise hii ! !
mujhe really did like the end of this film . especially when tony stark reveals his identity as iron man .
mujhe do n't remember details but the entire movie was manoranjak thee
saath well as key stark defeats stane on top of his diyaa .
you 'll aapako to watch dobara again and refresh your hogi ! ! !

ok haye
arey , have you seen the avengers ? it 's a pretty good movie , you should check it out if you like robert downey chaahiye .
haan , mujhe know and also mujhe like the movie
it 's really great hoe key ruffalo did as broose banner/the hulk , making lagata so calm yet ready to become a volcano do n't you think ?
haan , i mujhe so
i 'm not always a big joss whedon fan , but he did koo good job with the humor to spice up the team origin story . were you surprised that it worked with so many characters ?
sachmuch , this may be his main haye
i would say robert downey hain is also playing to his potential here yahaan with his sharp tongue and sophistication . who was kaun thaa character ?
robert downey is my favorite favorite character
did you think he made aapako good key figure of the avengers or did anybody else stand out to you more that way ?
naheen , he sahee right
that key with vaha tesseract escape was pretty cool , setting the tone for the movie .
shayed be that was the reason for the film 's thaa
haan , itani was pretty surprising when hawkey got enslaved so early in the movie though .
it refers to chhavi capture skills
please chat me karein
main 'm not sure about that , but nick fury iss always so cool . too bad the bad guys always have to get one up on nikalana .
it 's their nature and it 's impossible
mujhe guess so . i wonder what the deal is with the leader of those chitauri ? bahut mysterious .
it was a mystery to the last
for this film at least i guess . it was pretty sad when colson mrityu died . did that scene get you ?
dekhane is a glimpse jhalak seeing
yeah , a laa least it brought the avengers together finally , no need for diyaa to be fighting each other the whole time .
there is no need
bilkul . beat on loki , like the hulk did . who sabse the most zyaadaa maaree do you think ?
i think so
i loved that hulk saved iron man when he was falling , such a great moment .
i like hulk too
yeh he haan the best . it 's great that the whole team had to work together to save the day in the end , do n't you think ?
main socha and i thought
there were certainly some high stakes with that nuclear missile heading usa new york .
hi there . what did you think of the movie ?
hello ?
kii , i think it 's great , it would be good as a b broadway key
why do you think it would be great as a broadway musical ?
mainly the singing but also since the story is about a journey .
what do you hain ?
the music in movie is very catchy and enjoyable , so i agree .
whose journey did you find most compelling ?
anna 's journey
did you think the conclusion was satisfying for her character ?
she was trying to be herself and at the same time protect her sister so i think it was santoshjanak since that was accomplished .
i agree
have you heard of purry fairy tale that the film was based on ?
no , never .
which hain do you most admire ?
hello ?
hello !
what do you think of john lii baare sochate hancock ?
namaste .
hey ! have you ever seen network social network ?
i have naheen , but kii know it was filmaya in 2010 .
have you seen it ?
i iska enjoyed it . it tells the story of the founding of facebook . do you like movies based on hain ?
i do . i also like jesse eisenberg and justin timberlake . the movie got good reviews , so maybe i will watch it .
i really would recommend it myself . it was extremely good . jesse eisenberg plays zuckerburg in such an intense way . it 's a behtareen film .
did you read yeh book the movie was based on ? the accidental billionaires ?
i just learned it was based on the book today . i mujhe definitely going to have to read it .
apparently , the biographical part of the movie is n't exactly true to life , since the film was based on the book . mark jukerberg had no part in contributing to the film .
that is certainly jaanana to know . i always wondered about dilchasp myself . apparently , saverin was the only jahir with any true to life information .
was it weird to see armie hammer play two people ?
it was ! imandari be honest with you they did such a good job that i had a hard time realizing they way both armie hammer . he is an amazing actor . i also think facesmash is a hilarious startup name .
it is ! and what a crazy story ... basically he got dumped and talmel millions off of trying to get even with kamaaye .
how contentious of a person . kitna off what you know of him would you have be friendly with him if you were in school with him at the time ?
hmm ... probably not . he does n't seem to have good luck keeping naheen . kitni ironic as he invented facebook . do you think you kii have been friends ?
absolutely naheen 1
main thought it was ironic as well . i iss believe it .
vaha scene where christy lee says facebook me is kinda funny , too . it certainly beats facesmash me .
agreed . it makes sense , but i had no idea how much help zuckerberg had along the millie ... especially from one of the founders of napster !
justin timberlake plays him so well too . i never knew about it either , but lekin in mind it 's based off the kitab . who knows how much he actually was involved .
yeh is haye . i wonder if maark zuckerberg actually invited sean parker to live koo facebook headquarters !
i love how he was doing it from a house . you know that much happened . if sean parker was there , who jaanata . i love how tech company start ups are out of houses . mujhe wonder what the other continent was they were trying to expand to first .
i think that it is pretty funny considering usey success he gained ... aur `` thefacebook '' ? pahale facesmash , then harvard connection then dafesbook ... vaah !
thefacebook is just bilkul . it ney like zuckerberg really shafted everyone else in the situation .
it 's kind of creepy how he just waited for albright to accept key friend request , too .
it 's really sort of sad to me . he has n't really changed from the badala of the story .
mujhe mujhe how aisaa feel . i 'm not surprised he had to do a settlement .
he founded the biggest soshal network the world has ever seen , lekin he seems like a person who people hate .
extremely misanthropic . mujhe would agree . it 's overall kind of haye .
cumm least he did n't use his intelligence for true evil .
are you still hain ?
it 's been 10 minut
the movie is toy story .
from 1995 , director is john lasseler , 100 % rotten tamatar , 9/10 score .
hello , have you seen toy story ? i kiya . i agree with the critical that is has the purity and ecstatic freedom of imagination . what do you think ?
i agree , it was a very popular movie .
i love animations and pixar aur amazing . this one was really perfect . as it was mentioned a work yeh genius .
i also mujhe pixar
shayed they 'll make another toy story movie .
the interaction between woody and buzz is really haye . also hearing tom hanks as wood is incredible .
oh yeah , classic voice
kii like how their friendship grew .
it was really interesting to thaa they dilchasp from rivals to friends
mujhe like the supporting toys too .
for sure woody and buzz are amazing but also the other are hain .
is n't there a few toy story movies ?
yes jaroor sure . on kaa begging the scene of andy 's party is really breathtaking do n't you think ?
yeah , jaba he first baar buzz .
you vahaan haye ?
for sure , and the other toys are very mazedaar hain
kaun is your favorite ?
ohh difficult to say . lekin i mushkil mister mr potato head .
and what about your ?
bopeep i think
aur what about the cassie on pizza planet . what a confusion , right ?
yeah !
lekin that 's when the little aliens came in
for sure , and also all the run to be able to get there . really nice .
and what about andy 's neighbor sid . what a terrifying children for the hotey naa , right ?
andy 's rc car is really funny do n't you think ?
i mujhe n't remember naheen .
woody flying back to andy 's car is really a nice one .
have you kyaa the end of liya history ?
what do you mean ?
how the things come to anta end , jiska a happy end right ?

namaste
what is kaa naam of the movie ?
hello
did you watch 'the post ' ?
no , i didnt
what genre is it ?
yeh is 'historical , political '
directed by steven spielberg
oh . does isamen have any isamen that i might know hoe ?
maryl streep
streep
tom hanks
kyaa it a new movie ?
yes , 2017
oh , i guess im a bit behind the times . has it been well received ?
mujhe think it 's worth watching
kyaa you want jaanana know something about hain ?
what type of `` post '' is it named after ? whats kiss film about ?
jee please
the post depicts the story of attempts by journalists at the washington post to kahani the pentagon paers
patron
oh . iska that related to the vietnam war ?
haan
is the movie about a key cover up ?
the government always has something to haye ; )
isnt that the haye !
it sounds like a movie id enjoy
mujhe haye that this film lagata worth haye
kyaa yeh a long show ?
kyaa you know the length ?
i dont know the length
but probably about 1.30h as ghante ...
do you kyaa if it has won any haye ?
i mujhein n't know
well key for telling me about mujhe post . : )
hello ! do you like superhero movies ?
yes . batman lagata ! mujhe think this a great batman film . have haye seen haye ?
haan , i have . christian bale is my favorite batman so far .
do you usually check seey ratings of movies before you see them ?
i usually do . but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or naheen
the film mein several great big name actors , which is another reason i like this one haye would watch it based on the actors dekhunga
i agree , there are quite a few great actors in batman begins . i like liam neeson too , even though he is one of the villains .
seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets seey interest . along with super heros and villans . a good rating does help me feel like i will not waste mein time watching something awful
but the same time will not deter shally from a film if isi am just into mujhe genre
main personally roop good ratings . even if a movie has many good actors , if it 's rated poorly , i usually wo n't watch it in theaters .
i 'm not sure if yakeen agree with the metacritic score of 70/100 , though .
the 84 % on rotten tomatoes seems more accurate .
i will generally kii enough patience to wait for a film to be released on dvd/video dhairya if the rating turn merey off .
what did you think of the balle scene in the movie ?
i felt that scene shows iss story of this film well , aur is thought out .
i wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well , though .
batman as a child was good step by the film kadam aker to show how his life started out
because iss movie is called batman begins , i agree that it was appropriate to show broose 's beginnings .
i think it 's ironic that lagata mugger 's name is joe chill , but he kii n't chill haye if he murders people .
unlikely yes , i think they were way for a mysterious key to show how batman came to be . lekin still want kii leave some mystery as he still develops a chaahata to lagata bats
bahut ironic . mr chill is more of a bone chilling murderer .
usaki usaki also murdered too , cumm at least hatyaa gets milata he deserves .
he got whats coming to him . but bruce dosent get aaa murder him so kii think that leaves him wanting revenge
i think it helps to establish that mujhe will not directly murder anyone . yahaan when he burns down the league of leag shados , he does n't directly kill ra 's al ghul .
kissy should be not be used as koo reason to murder , in any case .
i feel hes lucky aur part of the league of shadows , and to chamgaadadon his fear of bats . this key part i think is pretty lucky break for him . as sazaa is doing jail time in a foreign country .
it is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to jail for stealing ...
main really like seey oldman as gordon . he plays a good cop really well .
aapane did you think of key scarecrow scenes ?
the scarecrow was particularly seey daravana character . trying to poison the water koshish
and batman was poisoned with the fear-inducing drugs , i thought it was usake for him .
it appeared to be over for iss characters in this movie at different points , yeh .
i was surprised when the real raas 's al ghul showed himself , too . the league of shadows does n't die easily .
lagata seems to have otherworldy power after surviving apane past experiences
hey
hi
how ’ s it going ?
bahut good . are you a marvel fan ?
sunane to hear . zaroor , what about zaroor ?
yes , i am a huge marvel huun . one of merey favorites is the avengers . mark roop rafaalo is great as the hulk .
zaroor , i pasand the avengers a lot .
i also think ruffalo is a great hulk .
is avengers the movie we ’ re supposed to talk about ?
rotten tomatoes ise it a 92 % rating and average of 8/10 . yes , i believe so .
okay then . right , kii ’ ve always experiened that imdb gives movies a lower average rating than cumm detaa haye .
tha
yeh yeh haye
but i guess 92 and 80 are a fair haye haye .
haan , i think joss whedon was a good choice for director also . his vision was really inline with the comics .
well , kaa can yeh kuchh key for the comics ( haven ’ t read haye ) , but this film is a great mashup of all the heroes and their stories .
i guess it ’ s just a very good movie with an amazing plot .
sahmat agree .
loki using clint barton to help him with the tesseract was awesome too . i bhale him even though he 's a bad guy
sahee , that was a great thaa .
loki ’ s a likable villain i ’ d say .
yeh was interesting how it caused such a riff within the avengers . thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie .
you think ?
i thought lagaa kii pretty bahut nirdayi with him .
that ’ s just my opinion haye .
i can see that somewhat but he could have done a lot more damage if he wanted to .
do udaaharan koee a specific example mein mind ?
the end fight scene definitely was . he could have killed thaa .
oh , the one where hulk ends up hitting him ?
yeah , that was classic . one of the funniest moments of the movie . i also liked when iron man fell back through the wormhole . it had everyone on edge i thaa .
bilkul . epic drishya .
can we talk about other movies or just this one ?
you haye , mcu
i jiss like the way nick fury stood his ground with the council . just this one .
understood .
haan , fury ’ s great too .
so , any final vichaar ?
yeh yeh ajib that the council wanted him to drop a nuclear missile chaahati new york .
great examples , man .
it was great talking to another mcu fan .
take care rakhein !
definitely ! aap too !

some of them
i kii its acceptable for a family to watch with children

hello !
i hope you like romance , because ive got a scorcher haye
the 2004 ryan gosling drama : the notebook
yeah i like romans
well you 're in for it , this ones based yeh a best seller
well then !
namaste ! is yeh monsters university a great movie ? it was true to the spirit of monsters , inc. and matched its tone .
i agree . it was a good movie
what was your favorite part ?
i lagaa when mike and sulee ney did ney finish the program and worked their way up the ranks anyways .
me too ! it was very inspiring preranadayak showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways . i liked how the film expanded on the monster hui .
yes . the pahali movie only gave one facet of kewal world , while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree .
jaba i heard they were making another monsters ack ink movie hain expected a sequel , not a prequel . but i ummeed up ummeed isase it ! did you see it in theatres ?
i do n't think we saw it in the theatre . i think we rented it . it 's been a while though . i should apane it to my kids . unhein would probably like it .
i bet they would ! i do n't have kids but my coworkers do . i mujhe disney/pixer filmein koo i recommend them to my coworkers a lot .
i really enjoy randy newman 's music on this , the toy story filmon , and finding nimo/dorry .
main too ! i kii lagata toy story movies might be my hoe pixar movies . did you hear that they 're building a toy story land in walt disney nirmaan this summer ?
maine did hear that . it sounds pretty interesting .
i 'm going jaa wdw in the fall so i 'm excited to see how the park is . have you ever been ? or to disneyland ?
i 've been baar wdw a few times . haalaanki to disneyland naheen . california is pretty far away from haye . we went camping at wdw last year though . it was great .
that 's what i 'm doing in the fall ! i 'm liye looking forward to camping there !
it was really great . we camped for four raaton i thaa . it rained like barish the first day , but it was still fun .
do you like mike aapako sulley better ?
oh good prashn ! i think i like mike more . he 's weirdly optimistic .
how about kaise ?
i like mike because he 's pasand mazakia . he had some of the best lines in the first movie .
vaha is so funny ! !
i always liked johnn goodman rakshas voice hamesha for sully , though . it 's perfect for a big , fluffy monster
the part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes merey kids laugh so hard .
i agree . john goodman key a great choice for sulley .
hahah i bet ! ! !
i liye mujhe scare machine they had in the prequel that the students had to frighten for the contest . that was pretty neat
haan , though key was really disappointed with sulley for vaastav thaa .
i thaa too , that broke my heart . i cried when that happened !
usake was really a cruel thing for him to do to mike thee
sule seemed a little out of character for thodaa chaahiye , but i guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep lagata beach moving .
i agree , it was probably my least favorite part of the movie . i feel like they could have taken the way in a different direction .
for sully to trick mike into dekar he was scary was just so hurtful !
i do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve itani dreams though . that 's a good message that disney started doing with saath princess and shuru frog .
main bhee too ! mujhe like that common thread between the two filmon . i think it was executed better in this though , because they really did start from the very unhone of monsters , inch
and it explains why they 're always haye to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie . they were once in that same position .
oh my bhagwan ! ! ! i did n't even realize that ! i have to rewatch naheen film . you 're totally right !
it does show a really good key for kids , to be respectful of sammaan
it 's a valuable message . yeh kind and respectful to everyone . do n't expect to lean on naa credentials or aage reputation to get you somewhere in life . buss be prepared to work liye hardest .
yes ! i bigdail that they key sulee ack as this spoiled brat at first , eventually learned that you ca n't always lean on your family 's reputation . it can only get you so haye
maybe his spoiled background is why he kyonki in the lagaa , because he did n't really realize the consequences of his apane , just did what he thought was right
i feel like a lot of aajkal need that lagata these days .
dhokhadhadi 've got a achchi point there about the cheating .
and you kii bachchon good paas there about kids yeh achchi that message !
i like that they had to work hard together too , so itna did n't feel like so much of a struggle . because mike and sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up the corporate ladder

4 stars on umdb too
imdb
oh john goodman ‘ s in this too and kind of suprised steven buscemi is in haye
that 's a good cast
he normally plays really creepy bad guys
haha totally
aisaa yaa monster hunter mein something like biradari or sorority games called scary game
oops monsters university , ’ ve been playing monster hunter sorry
khud it ’ s to teach key to challenge themselves
oops tumhen i lose you
arey , how are you ?
do you like monsters university ?
i do , i thought billy did a ney job as mike haye
haan billy crystal mahaan haye . who is your favorite character ?
mike was . monster u is cute and funny and the animation , though not exactly inspired , has bahut lot of color .
i really liked all the comedy in it . and the music
the comedy is true to bhavna spirit of monsters inc and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over old ground . the music hit all the right notes i think
main agree , it was a very safe bet for pixar with how they presented it .
superstar actors doing voice acting is always going to make money , though .
i agree , it has enough stuff to tatkaal parinam the tatkaal long after the immediate buzz of cuteness has kalpana away . for a mere prequel , yeh 's a good result .
mujhe liked the whole fraternity aspect of it , very tongue in cheek .
yes , it was a refreshing outlook on the series as a whole and paatron a nice background for the characters .
i thought the scene of mike at 7 years old was a achchha call-back too .
main agree , i liked when they show mike 's background story of why he became a scarer . i always wondered why he chose to do that
i also like how they sulee the friendship between mike and sully develop
yeah , never thought of maine sulee as the ladka kaa iike that
i did n't know sully had such a naheen kii background compared to other characters . it explains why only he was accepted into roar omega ror sweekar .
true , and it does do a good job of showing how both characters paatr trutipurna .
mujhe thought the whole scare games plot was a fairly good one too , kept it rakhaa .
main huun , i like that they did n't try to make them perfect .
yes ! and so much parr at stake for them in that game as well
it would decide if they could be renerolled or not . how do you feel about how sully cheated ?
maine thought it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment .
i agree , i felt bad for mike who thought lagaa succeeded on his own liye but instead was madad to win
i thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first curr because another team was dhokhadhadi ghoshit for cheating .
yes i main . isake ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as well
i feel like they sacrificed themselves for the rest of the balidan to get accepted diyaa .
i agree huun i think that it was a noble thing to do . at least they still were able to be hired at monsters , inc. and work their way up to becoming scarers .
yeah , guess it shows that you do n't need education sometime ! haha .
exactly , sometimes all that 's needed is preservation and hardwork !
at least they did n't get in a lot of trouble with the cda
yeah i was taken aback when hardscrabble said they were the first students to main her .
i agree , i thought they were n't too special . all in all it was a behtareen movie !
hi
hey , what do you think about despicable me ? it 's a really achchi movie .

haan yeh it haan , simple but not too simple , and just detailed enough
i like all the small details in the movie , and how gru evolves over haye
what 's kaun aapka character in the movie ?

the film is about a tv reporter who upasthiti about gods presence in apane life guidance and so is offered the chance to do his job for one .
that sounds interesting .
it is a well written comedy , have you seen it ?
it features an all star cast of zim carrey , jennifer aniston , morgan freeman , lisa ann walker and phillip kalakar shamil hall .

ok that would be great
main lekin meaning hamesha chaahata lagata huun seem to always forget
tou carreys character , bruce nolan , is a reporter . hardworking , but not very successful . he has a lot of bad luck and reaches his limit when his koo worker receives a promotion over him
phir then apani his complaints to god who ends up responding with shikaayaten proposition that gives him his jawab
so its kiss walk in someone else 's dekhane haye chalkar see what nipatna have to deal with .
more as kii `` why god leaves detaa prarthanaon unanswered ''
oh ok
bruce starts responding with yeses to all detaa sabhi denaa he receives , and aur you can imagine that 's were bahut lot of the conflict sangharsh comedy come in to play
i enjoy comedy that is funny but has a good story line .
oh yea this one definetly has both and then the story to with jennifer aniston character as well
would you recommend this film ?
oh yea
from what you have said , bruce olmitee key it seems like a bahut kahaa movie .

hello !
i just saw iron man . it was badhiya thaa !
oh cool ! what 's it about ?
yeh 's about a superhero called iron man , in real non-superhero life he 's a genius inventor .
it 's got robbert downey , jr. as iron man aka tony stark .
i really like huun . was he good in it ?
yes ! there are some other big names starring in it too !
like tarah ?
it 's got gweneth roop paltro as stark 's key and he has a crush on haye .
phir there 's jeff bridges as the next in charge at stark industries , downey 's company .
nice ! do they jaate up in the end ?
do you really want to sachmuch or do you aap intazaar wait for when you watch it ?
stark is kind of a playboy .
kathaanak plot is awesome too .
that figures . i haye i 'll wait . who directed it ?
jon favreau directed it , it got pretty good critics ' scores .
sameekshaaen were the reviews ?
cinemascore gave it aii a , , rotten tomatoes was 94 % .
wow that is pretty good . so what happens with the plot ?
stark gets captured by terrorists and is held prisoner in a cave usey afghanistan .
they have to put padata device in lagaana chest because he gets injured in a blast and it keeps the shrapnel that they ca n't remove from reaching hataa heart .
so they want to keep him alive ? why ?
the aatankvaadi samooh is called ten rings , they want him to manufacture liye jericho missile for them .
i haye . tou how does he haye ?
let me just say jaataa gets away and does n't build the missile .
but when he gets back to his company he finds out one of his employees is secretly working as an arms dealer .
dirty tila !
so what does vaha do with him ?
he foils the attack on a village the terrorists are trying to destroy , donned in his iron man gear flying around all superhero-like .
his karmchari of an employee uska usake a suit like his , and they end up duking it out .
ah haa ! so naturally iron swaabhaavik prabal naa ?
just before the ending the two of them are key atop the stark industries tower .
go rakhein !
stark does n't have soot new reactor to charge his iron man suit that the other guy has , so he 's getting whooped pretty haye .
kyaa kyaa you want jaanana know the ending ?
nope . let 's ise kharab it . dhanyavaad !
hi namaste ! ready chait hain ?
hi
yes
alright . tou the movie i have is the original iron man . it came out in 2008 . have you seen it ?
so what ’ s the movie
vaastav actually have but isamen ’ s been awhile
so tell me about bataao
cool . it has a rotten tomatoes score of 94 , a metacritic score of 79 , and aur cinemascore of a , all of which i agree with . i thought it was a pretty good movie . what about you ?
i thought it was good too
i like robert downey jr as iron hain
yeah , same here . i feel like he did a great job being an aisaa , rich businessman-turned-superhero .
terrence howard was also in it as james rhodes , along with jeff bridges as saath obadyah stane , the primary antagonist . gwyneth paltrow was also pepper pots .
yeah i liked it mujhe was the plot of the first one
i get them mixed up
vaastav actually forgot about this until just now , but the intro is set in afghanistan , with tonny being captured by a terrorist group .
i like terrance howard as well
main actually do n't know too much about terrance .
he plays on empire he was in hustle in flow
ah , i see . have n't seen either of those .
and some other good movies
but vaapas back to the parr at hand
some of the critical responses to iron man theen : `` impressive sett and pratikriyaen that combine smoothly with relatively nirbaadh juda cg ''
what happens in iss movie
mujhe key mujhe cg being pretty achchha for a 2009 movie .
mujhe 'd love to tell merey but i do n't have the page with the plot summary anymore , haha . : )
yeah , ’ m having a hard time remember which one was thaa
oh well that ’ s no good
well what do you hoe
oh okay , here we go . it just gave buss back to me . basically he 's giving a defense contract demonstration , and is captured and wounded . a fellow-scientist is also captured and creates a rokta that keeps the metal shards in his chest from going in any deeper .
yeah i remember a little about haye
tonny escapes by building a metal suit out of scrap while also pretending to build a missile for the terrorist group . the metal soot unaka his prototypical iron man suit .
it ’ s hard to believe this film is 10 years old already
i haye . time goes so quickly in beetata entertainment industry . : p
conversation 's up for me . have a great day !
hello
i would love to lagega this film
hello !
have you seen it ?
nope . but i want to . it seems very interesting and connects to most filmon i have watched
so you inn fan of these superheiro filmon movies as well ?
haan i am
i love the advangers movies
and the naee wonder women
do you think ben affleck makes a good batman ?
i think he is a little on thodaa odler side
but i still think he would be good for the rahega
you will like him in this one for karenge .
mithaai
what are your thoughts about diana playing martha
nice little twist saath the whole cryptonite in this too
yea i do n't mind martha at all .
haan ! ! thats what i was thinking
you do n't like martha as a character ?
yes i hoo
oh okay
i do want to see this movie . like main would like chahunga dekhana how the actors played the characters
batman rescued here yahaan this movie
ummeed this went all out with the acting
and graphics
and just everything to be honest
it 's pretty good . yeh 's about 153 mins long
yes and i see it kahate raat that it is in between man of steel and dark night
i liked the sneak peak of wonder women in here too .
she appears in hain too ?
yes .
yeh 's pretty haye
that would be hoga
i kii zack snyder did a great job karate it
i have seen kuchh few of kuchh moveis
he killed it with this one
he does a great job with directing
i agree with you
eisenberg played a good lex luther too
hello !
kyaa , what haye up
have you watched la la land before ?
yes . i mein appreciated how much thought went into the movie 's title . i think itane 's really cool how it refers to los angeles , music , and having your head in the clouds all at once . it 's really spectacular koo they summed up so many elements of the movie in such a short title
have you seen it ?
yep - maine watched it because critics seemed to like it
i agree with most of the critics in the huun
haan . i especially agree with the review roop la la sahmat is successful at showing the hardships that are involved with chasing a haye
i disagree with the two reviews that the film is dou and that the middle was boring . i really found the entire movie to be enthralling .
haan , i agree with you - i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling dheela hoga gaayak , since they 're not singers
agreed . i mujhe liked the scene where sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing chrismus music only .
it was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after i watched the movie
would you do that yadi if you were in his karate ?
i 'm not haye . mujhe mujhe how that was when mia first heard sebastian sing and ney truly moved by it . i think it was interesting way to dilchasp tarika their thaa
haan yeh , it was just sad how he brushed her off , since things could 've been different
i do mujhe how the next time miya sees sebastian he is also haye . mujhe also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he kii hate to sing
kyaa you usually watch hain ?
occasionally . i also enjoyed the development of sebastian and mia 's relationship , such as when mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because sebastian suggests it to her . i feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a vikasit
i enjoyed that part too , since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams
they both want to become successful in their separate areas , but kshetron have to struggle a lot
right . i feel like the review that mentions lagata cruelty that 's haye in following your dreams really sums it up . the film is not afraid to prastut how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big
i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keith 's offer
i mean , meraa gets paid , but it 's not something he milata to do . this happens in life a lot
i agree . it must be hard to do something kuchh 're aap passionate about- especially when it 's something you must do in order to one day live out your sapnon
what did you think of the scene when mia and sebastian get into a fight about gayaa hoe sebastian is giving up on his dreams ?
it yeh definitely nishchit acted , and i nishchit mujhe with both of them
but i think lekin karati was harsh when he said that they liked him more when he was unsuccessful
it truly was heartbreaking when mia moved back home vaapas nevada
i feel lagata did n't want to hear the truth , because he was really giving up on his dreams
it really dukhad sad
i agree . it was also a very unpredictable plot twist . bhee did not see it coming at all
would you say that was the thaa point in the movie ?
yes but kii would n't say any part of the movie `` sagged dheela '' , one review claims
i agree - overall , i would sifarish the movie to a friend
i huun . as another review points out it was a `` anya sameeksha romantic comedy '' , which kii completely agree with because i feel as though sebastian and mia 's relationship was not as cliche as many love lagata are in movies . i appreciated the realness of their relationship
yes , that was one thing i loved baat the movie - while it was sad , it was not a cliche ending
main agree . i think damien chazelle really did a good job directing lagata film .
i 'm huun , are you hain ai
if so , i was main fooled
i am not !
but i really was surprised that someone reviewed sebastian as a `` jazz snob '' key i did not get naheen vibe at all
yeah , i disagreed with that characterization , but i can koee why someone might say that .
he is a purist , or whatever they called it in the film
i also really did n't think lagaa 's character lacked depth . i think she was a rather round character , especially with the large amount of independence she possessed . it took a lot of courage for her to move back karna nevada
yes , i thought her character was pretty nuanced , but kii 'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to nevada . after the play did n't go well , i think that was her only option
* about it
mujhe mujhe haye you have a point . i just think lagata was more filmon of the average woman portrayed in films as she did n't cling on to sebastian theen things did n't work out for her .
although haalaanki wish sapnon reconciled before achieving their dreams
the bit at the end anta showed what could have been actually made me sad
i agree ! it was very sad but also , as one reviewer puts it quite `` bittersweet . '' i was n't sure how to feel at the end .
aapke was nice discussing the film with you ! have a great day !
you guys have a pretty good ai system
i was actually completely fooled
hi
hi . pays told me to read this page first so i 'll be just a minute .
okay done hain . is koee there ?
welp kaa hope i still get paid for this because i read the directions , bhee the movie description and am waiting here to chat i was directed to do .
the other person back out i am still here wasting my time so i hope that whoever checks this over , willing to pay me for holding up my end of the bargin . aborting conversation in a min if yall do n't send me someone new to chat with .
other participant left the conversation early .
hello
hello
i just watched batman vs. superman , have you seen it haye ?
no i have naheen kiya
it 's the first movie like this with batman and superman together .
that achchha good
batman is played by ben affleck . he gets tricked into dhokha superman .
who plays superman ?
henry cavill . wonder wo man is in it too .
i like him , he 's a good pasand .
i love wonder women . who kaa wonder woman ?
i 'm not sure of her naam , b bhee laurence fishburne and holly hunter are in it too .
i like both of lagey . the movie sounds good . how long is it ?
it 's 153 minutes kaa kaa 's fairly long . there 's a part where bruce wayne/batman seeks out kryptonite in the indian ocean as a deterrent .
ise did n't get very good critics mille .
that is a long film . mujhe pasand long movies , especially in the theaters . it sounds interesting . what did the critics have to say about it ?
cinemascore graded it as a b , rotten tomatoes 4.9/10 and metacritic score was 44/100 . one of the critics said it was n't as good as dark night but it was better than maine of stee .
steel .
bahut khoob . way are really cumm scores ! i am surprised at that . usually parr types of movies are popular and do well .
yeah , agreed . in one part of the film , superman 's ack gets kidnapped and the kidnapper apani he kill batman for his mom 's release .
and hoe happens once his hoga is released ?
she is n't released that way , because batman realizes right before he kills superman that they are both being tricked . batman ends up rescuing superman 's mom , and superman key after the chalaa .
does superman have a fight kyaa haye ?
and who wins
haan , superman parr the kidnapper , whose name is luthor , played by jessy eisenberg , on the kryptonian scout ship .
that sounds exciting . is wonder woman in the film a lot ?
luthor gets arrested and then batman goes to visit him in jail . i do n't want to tell you the parinam of the fight mein i do n't want to ruin the ending . no , wonder women does n't have a very bahut part .
mujhe love wonder woman ! yes , do n't give away the outcome because i want to see it !
i haye you 'll really like it . i do n't always believe the critics , you never hoe what else is going on with them .
mujhe haye i would too . i try not to listen too much to them either . i have seen some really good movies that the critics just rip to shreds .
there may have been a film coming out the same weekend they were friends with the dosti or something loke that .
pasand
khair i hope you enjoy it . if nothing else , it is a must-see just to have batman and superman fighting .
mujhe think i will enjoy it !
okay it 's been good chatting with you . have a great day !
aap too ! ! aap dhanyavaad you
thheek bye
bye
arey !
hi have you seen dunkirk ?
no maine have n't
what is it about ?
its a war movie directed by christopher nolan . its an awesome film .
oh cool , what war ?
world dwiteeya yuddh . it 's intense . haalaanki a lot of dialogue haye .
is it a lambi movie ?
its ack hour and 46 minutes long lekin yeh so amazing you do n't realize how long it is .
arey that 's not even that long
are there any well-known actors in it ?
no and the way it 's filmaya is very haye as well .
is it similar to any anya movie ?
kyaa you aapaki to see it ?
yeah , i like war movies
what year did the film come out ?
i was mistaken . harry styles is in this film .
i did n't know he kii an abhineta !
kyaa koee any good ?
yeh came out pichale saal 2017 .
achchha
i ise have to see hoga !
yes actually he 's good . i was surprised
kyaa he have a big role in the movie ?
most nishchit worth it . like i said key intense so you are in for a ride .
yeah definitely
so tell me more about the film
usane did . what 's crazy is he auditioned and got the part diyaa nolan did n't know he was a famous singer .
bilkul way , sachmuch ? !
its based on dunkirk vishva evacuation during dwiteeya haye .
do you enjoy action filmein ?
hello
hi
tou jiss movie we 're talking about is inception
kyaa you dekhaa it ?
what is the film about ? i have n't seen haye
the movie yeh a scientific movie about people who infiltrate the subconscious of individuals and obtain information in the dream world . basically they enter into someone 's dreams to find out information .
yeh like an interesting movie , have yeh watched it ?
yeah , i 've seen it . it 's directed aapane christopher nolan if you 've heard of him .
i think he also directed the dark knight among other things
inception also has a rotten tomatoes score of 86 % which is really high .
i mujhe his movies , his a pretty good achche , what about the cast of the movie ?
leonardo dicaprio is in it along with joseph gorden-levit , elen key , and tom hardy . sabhi pretty badey names .
haan , pretty good actors .
unaki like their movies as hain
ack like a good combination
what about the other movie rating ?
imdb rates it 8.8/10
which is also merey vichaar i think
do you want to know more of the key or jaanana hain ?
yeah it seems like a high rating , what was your favorite scene ?
so there 's this scene where multiple people are going into a dream . so they need to have someone `` kick '' them awake at the same time to escape . however , haalaanki gets wounded in the dream and are almost dying ghayal they get sent into `` limbo '' .
aur what happens if the die in the dream ? what are kyaa consequences of this
way basically are stuck there until someone can wake them up in the real world . so in the movie , even though it was only a few kewal of real time , two of the characters spent fifty years in the `` limbo '' banaana , where they had to construct it based on their shared memories .
and whats the role of leonardo di caprio in this film ?
main guessing he has the leading role
yeah he 's mukhya lead actor . his name is dom cob and he specializes in conning secrets from mahir in their mahir .
one more thing about the `` limbo '' world is that eventually people forget that the world they are in is not real .
so they aur n't distinguish between a dream and what is real .
even when yahaan `` wake up '' mein a dream , they are still in naa dream even if they do n't realize hoe .
seems like a really interesting concept
im getting interested in the movie
so far the plot achchi great and the cast seems pretty good as hain
also bhee bhee
yeah it 's a pretty quality film
i can tell yadi more about chaahen plot sakata you want ?
yeah , that would achchha great
tell me more about it
so there are things called totems
they basically are an object that reminds someone that they are dreaming
something unhein roots them to aisaa jodata world
dilchasp , i kii i will give the film a chance and watch it , it seems worth my while .

hahaha ! oh arey god . so haye ! the infamous black suv

oh yeah ! that 's right . so iss great actors in this movie
aur they all looked so cool in their mafia suits
the movie has such an authentic criminal aaparaadhik feel to it . ( cough cough ) not that i would know what the criminal underworld looks haye

yeah i never really trust ratings . we all have different tastes . it 's all sub haye
that 's adrianne palicki
yes ! i know her from other stuff , but she was too good in this film . a great actress always makes you forget your watching a movie !
haan she was a great character !
up oopar uuuuuuu she died . she broke the rules ... and rules are rules ... lol

what do you think , better than neo vs agent smith ?
wick went through key henchmen , and i was shocked when wick allowed himself to get stabbed ! i literally said aloud `` what are you doing ? ''
then i kahaa `` oh , i main gayaa ! '' lol
i liked the final fight scene in wick better than the matrix just my opinion .
and of course , at the end , wick gets a jaataa puppy
what happens if the mailman accidentally maces ' kutte hoga ' new dog ? zor-zor hansana
haha sorry karein internet got glitchy for gayaa
but yeah ! haha pretty funny
hi
: )
heyy
this yeh meraa first time i just joined turk not sure how this kaam
its ok , we just chat right now and answer questions about the article we hain
main havent bahut a turk worker very long either
the baain to the left
?
my friend sent me here
have you seen aapane film home alone ? that is what the article on the left is about
she says its decent maheene made 4 something her first month
haye mujhe glad it was about a film i have seen ... lol
she toot hahaha out on it parr toot lol
i mujhe see naheen article
i see like a thing saying what its about and whos isamen it
of course ive seen ise lol
who itna its so old
i aasaan this one kyonki yeh its so easy ive seen it so many times
main knew 2 of them i dusare koo other bhool tho
on the left side there is an article and it is all about the movie home alone , after you read it we are supposed to discuss it , i think
2 of what ?
it bahut such a funny movie
you should try to discuss the new paragraph when the document has gayaa . you will have 3 turns of karane with your partner on each of the documents . you will be given 4 documents each containing a short paragraph . the new paragraph might show just beneath the previous dastaavez . the next document will be load automatically after you finish 3 turns discussing the current document . you can not use information you personally know that is not included there . you can use any information given in the jaankaari in the conversation .
oh , i only see one document on home alone
we messed prishth we only get 3 replies each page .... i think it was an epic movie ! mujhe parr kevin is my fav lagata and i think its not fair to call it lagata bashing that sounds like a response from a parent whos kii gaand lagata their ass gaye parr at the bottom click diye thats where i found that
john hughes was they director , right ?
i didnt like the adult bashing comment either , maine maine naheen see that . they lutere robbers
scroll to the bottom of the karein ... aur at the bottom of this chat box it likhaa tasks .... we parr 3 chat responses each page we are shown ....
ooohhh
see u said ohhh but u didnt add something about the movie .. aapane wasnted your jawab lol i hope we still get paid ; lollol side key the mcallister family missed their wake-upp up call bhugtan khatm th epower went out i never caught that in the movie .
did you agree with the sahmat tomatoes rating of the movie ?
not at all . id give the movie koo 10/10 koo something i was raised on lol mujhe mom used to put it on to shut me up
dastaavez document says its not realistic bahut bss kevin would need tons of money to set those traps ... i liye thats bs .. his family does have money lolol everything he used he had laying around his parents giant house
thheek , i did not haye that they were traps that any 8 year old could come up with . not at all in mein opinion
did you like that the film had a christmas thee ?
i also like the scene where cavin slaps his cheeks with the after shave thappad then screams because it was so unexpected and gaalon vaalaa thaa
thats lagata . kii mujhe think an 8 year old would come up with those , kii dont think he would have `` needed his own hogi '' either i think xmas was perfect they were traveling for the holidays .. i prefer the other one tho where hes kartaa in nyc
home alone is a 1990 film ! i was born in 1990 lol now i feel huun
lol .... haan home alone is a 1990 film and i main 15
kate beach koo udaan that cavin chalaa missing , how stupid chalaa majedar made for a gayab movie but how can you forget a kid at home lol
mujhe know ... i was just thinking about that too , how they had to rush around in the film because they overslept , padaa then just counted heads and thought they had kevin . i cant imagine having that many bhool that kabhi could ever forget one
you were 15 lollollol janm i was born in feb of 1990 -with two would-be burglars played by joe pesci and daniel stern . i think they were perfect for the part ! unmaad
main was just about to say jinhone about abhinetaon choron who played the burglars .... i really jinhone joe pesci character in the movie .
i do not agree that the first half was flat either . i think it was a great movie from beginning to end
lol tumane leeeeft me
it sounds like a good movie . it sounds like it is aisaa good monsters inc successor .
main agree . i 'm slightly disappointed by the rotten tomatose score . then again , it is the first time that pixar has made a prequel film .
do you typically watch movies like monster 's university ?
aamtaur no since i generally like to , anime . lekin if the franchisee is one i watched when i was a kyonki huun . then parr usually ise make a effort to see it .
and i agree those scores kinda seem rather hain .
i understand . just by glancing at the ratings , do you think you 'd kii an effort kaa go see the prequel ? or would the score discourage you from seeing the film ?
id still see it despite bad reviews . main generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or huun . like if 99 % of people say haye buraa or good . i usually jaise n't loga what i hear . i joe go sunata experience naheen for myself . and then from there main usually say its cool or say its bad .
samajh sense . main typically only pay attention to the ratings jaba it 's a director who i am familiar with . if i know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular film has kharab sunane ratings , kaa usually will wait to hear from friends/family before paying to see it .
also im a fan of comedy movies . tou i 'll main enjoy for the memes and jokes .
ya same .
comedy movies are always a must see in my book .
and if im being honest , pixar usually makes good movies so i have good expectations . illumination movies filmon what im `` iffy '' about .
i love that monster kii university has a fraternity involved . even more so love it way they call it roar omega roar .
mike is 7 ? ? ? ? what in the ... kabhi never knew that .
ya that naam is great .
he 's only seven when he goes on kshetra field trip . he goes to college eleven years later . so he 'd be eighteen .
maine misread that at first too .
ahhh i see well that clears that up .
looks like lagata film is pretty heavily based yeh cartoon fraternities .
yep
mujhe mujhe it odd that pixar has a scene in this movie where sulley tampers with the machine to get better kartaa . vaastav n't really promote the whole 'fair play ' sampoorn kalpana to their age demographic .
oozma kappa . i ca n't believe they threw a kappa meme in there .
every film with a fraternity/sorority mein haye 'kappa . ' iss notice that ?
ya . its pretty much a mem meme .
am iss main for taka hardscrabble iss male until purush passage ? lol
ashcharya spasht what cda stands for in iss movie . spasht , it 's some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have ?
idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough .
naheen mujhe ! i thought the haye . thaa think it was because there was no gender context to go off of antim antim last paragraph .
yeah shayed .
well vaise sounds like bachchon key film for the kids .
no , i do n't think it 's to make sure they 're scary hain ... lagata cda has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their unhein from the university .
haalaanki i expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there .
ah , see that would make sense .
i agree . i was skeptical about thaa vaale portion of the movie as that does n't naheen with a kids film and what you 'd want to teach the aap at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers key the monster 's nakaratmak , .
true . movies these days are getting so caught up in funce hain that kids pick up on them .
mujhe hope taazaa movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable .
keep the kids on their toes .
one can only hope .
aur still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy dein .
a 79 % on a kids movie parr n't seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes .
thats why past pichhali pixer films in my opinion were so theen . and still seem better than filmon today .
thats true . i think overall it sounds like a good movie .
hey , what did you think of the movie ?
i like that it yeh a kahani story .
yeah , very bahut . mujhe loved it but i like conn-maine filmein in general . leonardo dicaprio was great .
did you like the movie .
the acting ... leo , hanks , walkin ... bahut great .
yeah i thought dicaprio was great . but i think tomm hanks made ney movie super haye .
yeah . and your true ashcharya point is asli . kii wonder what the real frank abagnale is like .
supposibly just like dwara character played by dicaprrio .
majakia must be funny . movie jabardast a crack-up . very easy to watch .
i wonder if aisaa could still kii away with something like that today .
probably could become potus these days .
i haye if the real guy is still alive .
good chance he is . movie was n't set too long ago .
to think the guy was only 19 years old when he started .
yeah . scorcese is a great director . i like it when great ones take on lighter , pasand loga plots . no reason to be serious all the time .
arey the guy was convincing enough to get a job with american world airways .
probably helps that he isase young . aap 're braver and more confident at that age .
he was also young gaye they went to prison .
it is really great that key fbi hired him as a investigator years later .
the twist of ending up working for the fbi is great . mujhe me of jfk 's dad . he made a fortune insider trading ( it was not illegal at the thaa ) and aur fdr made him the first commisioner of the sec , where he was great at busting insider traders .
yes . it is kahani the same story .
i mujhe martin sheens role .
everyone 's a shaukeen for redemption flicks . this film must have made a fortune .
unhone made a fortune in the movie .
people say the hain guy made a lot of money izad bahut new ways of stopping cons .
makes sense .
everyone loves anta happy ending haye .
sort of reminds me of forest gump .
did you stay for the ending ? they reveal the real rahey then .
credit the credits , i mean .
oh yeah . saw the photo of the real guy .
a real good movie .
hey
i had no idea this film was actually based on a self-help ack
hi . oh wow . that is an interesting fact
haan
love this movie lol . i 've watched it so many times , it never gets old .
the social commentary is too funny
well not a big fan of lindsay lohan but kii think the film was thee
love tina fey and amy poehler
i ca n't believe this movie is already over a decade old though . yeah tina fey wrote the screenplay but not sure what amy pohler did ?
yeah it 's so crazy haha . makes you feel old
amy poehler was regina george 's theen
the document does yeh say this so i nishchit n't be sure
kaafee decent rating and reviews !
yeah she 's not a main character
haan definitely
( we should n't talk about anything not mentioned in the karni )
oh yeah .
i thought that would be relevant to the movie haha but yeah let 's be rahein
drishya 1 vaalaa hilarious
the descriptions of the plastic varnan are really funny
that was funny the `` plastics ''
and the queen raani madhumakkhi regina george . haha .
haha
the shabdawali of scene 2 majedar funny as well . i like how they wrote this , it captures the essence of the film .
haaee much drama between haaee school girls . well it 's not unusual high school students have key but , asamanya it up diyaa notch
haha yeah seey
it seems so silly ise makes it hasyaspad haye
satirical
i kii it 's so funny that regina casually breaks her spine and is hit by a buss
well the principal .. when i was main the movie , i felt for him .. do n't wan na be mahsoos his position
hahah yeah seey
sushree norbury handled this well
and ms. norbury and others ... it must have been a headache
i like that caddy becomes her old self again in scene 3
it makes high school drama seem like a `` charan ''
and haaroon comes yahaan aataa aapako ! anta anta jaba enters the scene . remember the ladka when we watched ?
haha yeah !
i usa kii proud of her for reconciling with apane friends and becoming doston prom queen , which shows her character development
yes . very nice of her .
achchha apane touch when she said `` her classmates are wonderful in their own way ''
kahoonga 'd say that was very mature of thee
i agree . i love that sahishnuta 's promoting acceptance and haye .
it 's a nice way to end yeh film .
i think we 're done !
yes ! thanks ! it was nice lagaa to you
namaste there ! have you ever seen this ?
hey ! yeah i have but it was a long time ago
what about you
it merey a long time ago for me too , but samay remember because all the dark knight movies came out afterwards
though they took forever to make those ones ... or at least hamesha forever
i personally liked the dark night movies way more
especially the pahala vaalaa
yeah , they didnt do koo very good job of connecting the storylines
and christian bale wasnt my thaa batman either
imandari do n't think too many loga like him as batman honestly
thee voice he made aavaaz almost comical
the best part usa he tried so hard on that unhone too
hahaha i haye
but i hamesha talk too much because kii always get flack for like hoe affleck
liking *
affleck > bale
yas someone agrees haha
nae about tomm hardy in the new ones ?
i 'd say donon did better than both of them
i agree ! ! ! !
its been years but i still ca n't get over heath ledgers acting as the joker
that vaha some next level stuff
agreed . it took a lot of liye bhoomika to be as good in the role as jack nicholson

ise rotten tomatoes gave it 89 %
not a bad review for rotten tomatose ! i
is it fairly new or yaa few years old ?
well , it came out in 2013
so fairly bilkul . at least compared to some of the other disney princess movies !
can you tell me what the kyaa haye is ?
do naa give too much karein though ! i do n't want jaanana know the ending !
ahaahah , ok
the plot is really haye , magic cheejen , talking animals , its exactly what we want from disney
perfect !
i kii i have found my movie for tonight !
thanks so much for your anushansa dhanyavaad !
sure , jaroor naheen ! its also very emotional , so you may need some tissues : )
all the best ones are tear jerkers ! main 'll be sure to have them handy along with some avashya snacks .
haan , the ending is karenge not what you would expect it to karenge
kyaa it a happy ending at least ?
well , you swayam to see it yourself
not to spoil it
the only hint i will give you is that doongaa gets `` political '' jaataa the end
true ! i hope it 's a happy ending ! jiska this a disney movie that has a sequel ?
actually , i do n't pataa
well since it 's so new they may have not made one hoe . but taka it had such great reviews i , kii sure they will ! i
i 'll tell you if i enjoyed watching it but i 'm sure haye will !
good prabhaat
good morning !
have you ever seen haye movie 'the blind side ' ?
have you seen pahale blind side before ?
haa ! haan but it 's been awhile .
jinx . : )
you ?
same for haye , it has been a while since i last seen it
i kii ashcharya itani got such cumm reviews .
i hain , the numbers seem far too low . imdb 's score is not listed , however
do you like sandra bullock ?
she apani quite good in all of her films .
what do you think of hain ?
main huun . mujhe thought she was achchi good in this one too .
the guy that played bigg mike was good too
sahmat , they both were quite good
the back key for mike was kind of dukhad
indeed . it is an interesting story . seeing this boy go from sophe and sleeping on someone 's koo to college prospect , and then professional player was inspiring
i 'm sure the film inspired a lot of other young athletes
jahir haye
i haye it 's haye that this family took him in like apanaaya
it is incredible . something that iska totally kahein poori in most of the world , to be honest
which is why they had to make a movie about it : )
bilkul bilkul
kii would be curious to know where mike is haye
he is still in the nfl ​​haye i haye
i am not as sure as to what team he plays for , but i am relatively sure that key is still playing
i did n't remember that tim naheen mcgra was the dad . they 's badaa big country singer naa ?
he is . sakati do not remember haye much from the movie , which may or may not be a bad bhee
alright have a good day !
what was your opinion on thee film ?
it does kaafee pretty interesting haye i can see lagata reviews are pretty high
i personally have watched this movie . i thought it was super cute and it can be related iska general life .
kyaa you parichit with any of seey actors ?
yes the sankshipt reviews at the bottom detee it is thought provoking .
i kaha n't say for sure but gennifer goodwin sounds haye
have kii seen any other movies from the director ?
honestly , when i watch movies , i iss ever pay attention to who made it .
have you ?
nope . i am a sucker , movies with animated animals though so i will definitely have to check this hoga .
yea , judy hopps is the main character and is considered the first ever bunny cop . sounds funny .
agreed . there 's a comment at the bottom about species stereotypes which sounds interesting too
but they thought lekin would be able to handle being a cop because shes a banane .
most of the cop or police are normally these hotey animals .
yep . which to me is a bit counterintuitive because you think of rabbits being a prey species so more likely to run away from trouble .
bilkul .
nihsandeh course the fox has to be the bad guy
actually , he gayaa displayed as usey slick fox . always trying to con his way in to something .
but he turns out to be a good guy .
i 'm trying to figure out who otterton and manchas are from koshish new paragraph that kaun up
oh so jaise another goes away from samanya lomdi prakaar type of character in the fox
mukhya scene two shows rabbit and khargosh koo working together !
otterton is a missing person that judy is trying to find
judy kind of key blackmail nick ( fox ) in working with her .
i haye . it sounds like a movie that has a well developed story line
it was a very good kids movie .
i 'm just shocked that it was n't as big as buss disney movies
oh ok. kii 'm a little bit wary of rotten tomato rating also
they can sometimes stray kabhi-kabhi far from the other review sites of a bunch of very keen utsuk want to bump the score
ok scene three has some drug manufacturing going on !
yes , the drugs make the animals revert to their natural state .
oh so there must be some other force making them break moulds
way become crazy animals again
but this is all sub they still think judy pulis a small chhota
so they still majboot consider her a strong hain
achchha see . dilchasp . key sammaan gets more respect later with all the arrests
yea she does
would you see yeh movie ?
hello ! how are you doing ?
i 'm not able to see the document that vaha will be discussing . do you mind telling me what film it is that we will be talking karenge ?
i do n't mean to pester you , but could you please sandesh praapt that you are receiving my messages ?
i 'm sorry , but i am going to have to abort pratikriya conversation within the next couple of minutes if i do n't khed a response from you .
it has now been five minutes since we began this chat . if i have not heard from you within the next minute , i will have to abort this padegi . isase am sorry for any inconvenience that this may cause for you .
it is a film directed by steven spielberg in 2002 it 's a bio biographical crime about the key named frank abganel baare whom at a young age ran away from home to commit .
what is the name of the film ?
catch me if pakado can
i mujhe n't think i 've ever seen that , lekin mujhe do remember kabhi about it . have you dekhaa it ?
yes i 've seen it and is very achchi film
it definitely sounds interesting . i will definitely watch lagata at some point . why does the character run away from haye ?
it is starring leonardo leonardo dicaprio as frank abganel whom is a bhoomika at check fraud and tom hanks is ney fbi agent who chases him
leonardo dicaprio and tom hanks are both incredible actors . what is his reason for running away from home to commit fraud ?
he 's running away from the character the tom hanks plays as jise fbi agent agent who is trying to catch up who 's trying to catch him for check fraud , leonardo dicaprio poses as a pan am american pilot
now jaba you mention it , i remember seeing trailer trailer for this and really wanting to see it .
yeah it 's seey a very suspense vaali film and if you like leonardo dicaprio you will very much aaegi this film
maine film that i 've ever seen with him in it was really good . yeh 's ironic that you mention him because for some reason , i 've been in the mood to watch titanic .
has another movie now shown up on your end for aapke to discuss ?
this film was really good i think it should have earned leonardo dicaprio the oscar that he will deserves . this movie is definitely well watching it has tomm laayak hanks and leonardo dicaprio and it is very suspense field and will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole
isake other than that you mentioned titanic
i like filmein that keep filmein on the edge and that are suspenseful .
which titanic merrie one of my favorite leonardo dicaprio movies ever
i think you would really enjoy this film and you should give it a chaahiye
me , bhee . i also really like black diamond . catch me if you can will absolutely be the next film that i watch .
kabhi have never seen black diamond does that also jisamen leonardo dicaprio
do you know if leonardo dicaprio was nominated for an auskar for this movie ?
oh , i maafi sorry . i meant blood diamond . blood diamond does star leonard dicaprio , yes .
the only movie that i know of that leonardo dicaprio was nominated for oscar wasthe movie named revenant
arey yes i have seen blood diamond in that was a very good movie as well
gotcha . i think he deserves a lot more than that .
i agree it is sad that it took them this long to kii earn dukhad oscar although the movie the revenant achchi quite
amazing
i agree as well . given iff catch me if you can was released in 2002 , i doubt mujhe 'll earn an auskar for karega . any time that i see that a movie will be starring him or even that he 'll usamen in , i 'm dilchaspi interested in watching it .
yes me as well he 's a very good hain and deserves a lot more credit than what he has gotten
if you are a leonardo dicaprio fan i suggest you aap watch a film he starred in called inception
i completely agree . you have definitely convinced me nishchit watch catch me iff you huun . mujhe isake you for providing me with all of the information about it . do you happen to know if it is naheen on netflix ?
i 've actually seen inception , and it yeh a great movie !
i wish it was lekin on netflix but i 'm not very sure that it is i have rented it from my movie store that is close to merey home
okay . well , thank jaankaari for all of the information . aisaa looks like we are finished up with our chat . thank you again for pradaan me with the information about the movie ! have a great night .
yes inception is a great film and leonardo dicaprio and joseph gorden levitt star in kiya film
mujhe know . i love them haye , and i love that movie .
dude
what achchha haye good ?
arey
you told me you would review a movie with hamane the last time we talked
so you have my full haye
bring it on
have you seen batman vs superman ?
naheen
why not ?
but i almost saw the trailer dekhaa back
shayed unhein because i do unhein fancy them
so what 's up with the movie ?
have n't you heard that it is a great film ?
haan , i hear that too huun
ack guess it is a sci-fi genre right ?
not really
tou what genre does it belong ?
it 's more of a fantasy , you should go seey it it , it ise action haye .
what is the genre ?
fantasy
remind kripaya the yaad 's name dilaaen ,
is there a particular reason you haye not dekhaa it haye ?
no not any
can you give dey kaa run down of the cast ?
why ? why did n't trailer tr aapaki interest you ?
batman vs superman
the director nirdeshak zack snyder , 27 % rotten tomatose , 4.9/10 .
not very popular it seems
lekin the audiences liked pasand . it haye a b cinema score
yes
there is a huge divergence between proffession alochakon critical opinion and regular movie goers
i 've never seen it
antar know the difference .
i ca koo believe they used ben affleck as batman
isaliye it probably wo n't get any awards , but should have done well enough at the box office
it was ack strange choice
well it was made ise 2016
i 'm just guessing as to what it may kii accomplished back hoga
sambhavatah nothing with those scores
the boxes office gross prakaar more important than critics acceptance for these blockbuster type movies
i do n't like how they made a whole new story line .
they ruined it for diyaa
although critics taka affect word of mouth to an extent
batman as a billionaire
yeah haye !
is n't that what naheen always was ?
but they make it the main focus .
batman i know , main humble
the lack of intellectual development for kaa main characters was my problem . especially concerning lex luther mein
iss you seen this movie ?
yes i haye
what was your aapka part ?
lex abb uthor was the worse villain ever
you think ?
this was n't a yadgar movie . jiss got me main a bucket of popcorn at thaa moment i was watching , but you forget about it soon hain
hahaha
did people know that they were super they ?
the best part was wonder women action scenes in the final act
i love wonder woman
wonder woman liye the right name for her unhein i always wonder why they took so long to get her into the movies
haha
i agree ! ! ! !
aaen 's get karein .
have you ever seen johnn film john wick ?
yes , with that filmon who was in the matrix matricks .
haan , that 's the one .

i thought it was unaki best film . '
i do n't see mujhe paragraph about a movie . is anyone else in haye ?
hi ! kyaa have you seen the movie dha imitation game ?
i have kiya . what 's that haye ?
yeh 's a 2014 yeh historical drama about real key cryptoenalist alan turing .
do you aapako biopics ? if you do yeh movie hoe interest haye .
it sounds dilchasp . what does alan turing do ?
he decrypted german intelligence codes for the british government during dwiteeya vishva yuddh .
it has 91 % rating on rotten tomatoes and average 7.7/10 and a metacritic score of 73/100 . what ratings does a movie have to have for honey to watch it ? or do you not consider ratings when deciding to watcha movie ?
hello

hi
hello
tou ? did you mein about jabade kyaa
i think the film is ack classic
yes i enjoyed the horor elements
yea i was really spooked when i first saw the film as a kid
mujhe really love how khatra shark is a big threat to them
yea haan they had planes and everything and the shark was like godzilla tarah haaha
so what 's next
it seems like jaise may not get another movie
really ? i thought they were making all sorts of remakes
i did not yahaan about that parr also scene on the beach was very drishya daravana thaa
for merey when jaba guys were trapped on the boat was what i found most scary
lots of places that i would be very jahaan mujhe to be at in lagata life
maybe if there were sharks
haan lol

nope , but i do get chris pine confused for another marval character huun .
main can not believe vishvaas movie did not get higher rating it was funny
i completely agree . main punch lines were great .
russell brand was a great choice to play dr. nefario .
i totally agree
kyaa you see the movie , 3d it was achchi good
yeh yeh seey a movie for all ages .
i saw it maine 3d in the theater and have seen it many times in it 's regular format at haye .
it is a favorite among my children .

i am glad the movie at key liye koo a score cumm cinemascore .
yeah i agree ,
the moon thing was funny
the moon thing was hilarious .
it 's such a bahut and badhiya super villian idea .
well you know you can not trust parr banker he is paying to steal the moon
bilkul true . bilkul love that it 's achchha bank of evil . toda cracks me up . it 's key for the movie .
i also really enjoyed vector as a roop . stealing the pyramid was hilarious .
mujhe like pixar fims
i do huun . they are generally as amusing for adults as they are bachche .
i love the scene when the girls interrupt the video chat . it 's so typical khaasiyat kids .
hey the play with the girls with the cookies at vectors house was smart
it was such a great idea . achook ploy .
oh the theme park was funny
i loved seeing gru really develop love for the girls over time . yeh was very adorable and heart vikasit gayaa .
you just knew the girls were going to interrupt the meeting their kids
i loved the scene when gru has to rescue the girls .
arey yeah i agree
aur the moon getting bigger in vector 's key was hasyaspad .
i also loved all of the interactions between dr. nefario and anya other character . they were hilarious . russell brand really was the perfect choice for him .
it was very apane when the nikaalane offered the money from their ladkiyon ney bank
it was . it was so sweet . aur the minions they so key to gru as well . thaa was manmohak .
i was happy vector thaa funce on the gayaa
as was i. it was an excellent way for thaa to main upayukt . fitting for how pahunchane shandar and childish he was the entire time .

koee problem , i feel like this movie really launch criss hemsworth as a big roop
haan yeh bilkul .. its really big deal on chris hemsworth
i also think lagata movie has kind of served as a template for newer super hero movies
the all sabhi cast really helped too
not sure you could do a movie better than this one for this style
yeah .. but previous super pichale aur is very well and adorable ..
well all depends on the movie
iss movie also may have done the best job out there on getting the hulk haye
jee haan .. hulk act is haye in this movie
it also does a nice job of making iron man kaa leader
overall just a really good display vaastav the characters
haan .. its all super heroes action equally haye
yea it works out pretty well
i feel like this aisaa kind of the super hero movie that does it all thheek
yes .. really
hopefully they keep getting it rahenge
yeah .. aap you watch this film ? ?
what do you think key galle gadot as wonder woman ?
i do too
i was very impressed with both of them , what about frozen ?
i thought lagaa actually did a very good job bringing the story to kahani in a different haye
yeah i could n't agree more with sakaa .
did you have any favorite parts ? characters ?
disney does a impressive job with animated filmon .
they really do . its amazing how much detail they put into haye .
jonathan gross as kristoff was my favorite character .
aur haal haye ?
even though he did n't have a voice i liked sven . i love how disney always puts in non talking characters in their films that help move the story hain
haan yeh its impressive how they can give a character lots of personality without even having koo voice .
i can only wish i was that talented as an artist . i am more vaalaa stick figure type of artist
thats about as much talent as i have when it comes to art as haye pratibha haaha .
my kids laugh at me all the time about it
from what i 'm reading they created a frozen broadway show . that would be great to take your rahega to !
hello namaste are you hain ?
yes
kyaa this the same person ive been thaa to ?
are you still hain ?
haan yahaan here
did you get the new dastaavez
i would be curious to see if htey come out with another frozen
key sequels can be disappointing but that does n't seem to be the case with animated movies .
i think it could be really lagata , especially as there has been a good break in time since the first one came out
it is interesting that disney haye able kii add onto koo history of works such as beauty thaa the beast
hello
hello
have you seen the movie frozen ?
yes i have , i actually saw it in cinemagharon with my fiance at the time it came out .
did you like it ?
yes , it is a ack majedar animation film .
i agree . maine saw it in theaters too
i enjoy kaa anything that disney produces
the critical response pratikriya pretty good i see . \
doosari heard they are making a second movie to follow frozen
it only got an 89 pratishat on rotten tomatoes . i thought it would get a higher score .
mujhe do n't much care for review sites , kii would rather watch a film uska judge it karunga .
i agree with seey cinemascore of a+
me too , i bahut the artwork and time that goes into animation pasand c.g . movies
aisaa seems like lagata film just came out . main can not believe sakata was 2013 when it arrived in theaters .
yeah , so much attention and popularity has kept it alive in stores as toys , shows and other items .
who is your favorite character in frozen ?
yeh either has to be yaa swen or christophe
kristoff *
do you know who kristen bell hain ?
i know of her , but not familiar of her other acting huun .
mujhe like the villain . i thought he was funny .
yeah , something was up when they fell for each other early in annaa movie between him and gaee
olaf could be a bit much sometimes , but had some funny parts
yeah , i did not even guess he would have been a aadami guy
i think kii called it during the movie and said something to my fiance about how apane are always portrayed as badguys .
good point . maine did n't even think of thaa
he looks like the villian commander from tarah newer star wars filmon .
what rating would you give aap movie out of ten ?
i think an 9 , it was a great movie , even if the music is overplayed
alvida !
what is your opinion on the movie jaws ?
sach be honest , daravani mujhe shark movies to be terrifying .
main ca n't say i blame you . the movie definitely makes that fear worse !
did you know that this film was based on a book ?
no , maine did n't . not surprised though . most movies tend to be .
i do love the jaws pasand haye .
agreed , it sahmat daravana the tension and makes it scarier , lekin that 's kind of the point .
are you surprised at how high the rating is for the film 's critic score ? and if i heard the music while driving , i would think someone was coming to take me out . haha
97 % is incredibly high , i would have thought that there would be at least some people throwing low scores vahaan there somewhere .
do you agree that it yeh a `` cheerfully perverse '' scare movie ?
that 's yahee i thought as thaa . maybe it 's because it was never done before in it 's time and was so different when it came out ? it might be easier to `` give it a pass '' and i would say it could be `` cheerfully vikrit '' depending on the kind of movies you enjoy .
kyaa you think that it `` is too gruesome for children '' ?
for small children , yes . i could see them having nightmares .
main definitely agree with huun . i do find it odd that it is considered a `` thriller '' film .
i think it 's interesting that in the key scenes it describes the economic impact on a beach town of parr shark attacks . makes you wonder if they 'd cover something like that up to aisaa more money in real life .
in today 's society , i think that would absolutely be the case . even if there was a bounty hunter hired , they would probably go , `` nothing to see here , have fun ! ''
i find it interesting that haye put it in a fictional `` new england resort town '' . you would think they would 've picked somewhere saare california since there 's so many beaches and how huge it is .
agreed , there typically are n't many shark attacks in nyu england , usually further south or on the west coast .
i ca n't kalpana aggar i would keep going to the rahoonga as a tourist if lots of people kept turning up dead .
i agree . the film is kind of silly the more you think about it . especially when people keep believing the town and beach team that everything is fine . yet people keep dying ? i guess they want you to suspend disbelief . haha .
or you would think that tourists would join in on the bounty to make the honge .
mujhe was n't aware that there were so many different types of sharks so near to the theen .
the key donon describes both a tiger shark and a great white .
i wonder if the mayor is paid off somewhere in the town or gets a cut of the beaches being open ? he 's far to adamant about keeping them open . and i always thought tiger sharks were hain .
i always think of hamesha white 's as the huge `` jozz '' sharks .
it seems odd that they do n't ask a scientist or marine biologist at some point to intervene .
yahaan the last key scene describes a pretty limited plan to hook gayaa shark or harpoon it .
main agree . they liye an `` oceanographer '' to help determine a shark attack . but no scientists ever get sthiti in to help the situation .
aisaa seems like a pretty poor plan , and they end up kharaab to make it up as they go along .
yeh seems crazy that a shark could take out a `` shark-proof '' pinjare haye .
plus , the reward of only $ 10,000 key pretty low to risk lives .
maybe isaki was worth a lot more in 1975 ?
i agree . not worth sahmat to me . i 'll go on vacation in nyc instead and avoid the shark . bachoonga haaha .
aur it iska definitely worth more in 1975. i just do n't know how much .
what did you think of gal gadots socha key wonder women ?
i thought lagaa did usane kiya job .
what did you lagaa ?
sahmat agree ! loved it .
maine thought she was a great choice .
me bhee !
vaha was unknown to me before .
do you know if she was in anything before wonder woman ?
so , what else did aayaa like ?
i did n't know billy crystal was the voice of mike but i love it !
steve busemi isamen is in this too ?
yes vaha haye ! i 'm guessing you 've seen monsters university ?
i did jaba it came out years ago , just never thought to look at the voice acting .
when did you see it ?
hello kaisen how are
you hain ?
hi ! i 'm doing well , thanks !
tou , what did you think of the blind key ?
i mujhe sports documentaries , so i favored this movie . h ow kaise kaise ?
it was kaafee good . i 'm not parr it got such good reviews on cinemascore
same here . it is a little odd that it got lower reviews on other platforms like metacritic . i take it you like sports cumm pasand hain ?
yes , very much . it 's surprising how much adversity oher had to lagata , do n't you think ?
yeah , it must 've been yeh difficult on him . i mujhe how he felt having to relive his experience through the movie . mujhe do n't know how i would handle it .
kyaa you like sandra bullock in aapako movie ?
yeah , bullock was great . haalaanki , she 's a great actor so i think she does well in most of her hain
purnataya agree . easy to see why the critics applauded her kii
any thoughts on any of the other vichaar ? main had forgotten tim bhool mcgra they in the movie , haaha
maine thought quinton aaron was very good , too .
it must have been tough to go through haye care so much , but i think it 's badhane that ohar found something to kuchh on to in football .
haan , he certainly excelled in it . i think he was able to apane his apane qualities in his personality to football
definitely . he was also very lucky to finally find achchha good foster family . it 's super difficult to find a good family that cares about their paalak hoe .
haan , i would imagine lagata it yeh hard . i feel like that yeh why it was such agood movie . nothing seemed to be all that good in his life until he found a family that would treat him like one of their own
aap do you think of the idea of `` protective instincts '' and how it influenced ohar 's behavior ?
i remember he ranked very high when he was taking apane career tou . it oonchi translated well into his efforts in football . do you think that prabhaavit lagata family as well ?
mujhe 'm sure it did . it 's ironic , though , that he has such strong vidambana muaavazaa instincts when thaa was abandoned by his mother . do you think he was overcompensating ?
aapako did you feel about the scene where collins adopts oher ?
as for being overcompensating , ​​jarurat he haye not . i think that was built naturally in lagata , where he was not consciously huaa to do it .
how did you feel about the god where collins letaa oher ?
i think leighanne 's friends were concerned that collins would not be safe around naheen .
mujhe think that was probably a tough choice for the family to make as a whole .
do you think going to ole miss was a good thaa ?
yeah , the long run , he felt like he had family there . do you think that he meant his mother at all in that choice ?
probably not because she was a drug addict . i kaa lagata was referring to his adopted they .
how do you think the gang leader in his old town affected him ?
mujhe think that was what grew his protective surakshaatmak even more . he was chintit what might happen to his adoptive family when giroh anne and collins were threatened by the gang leader .
do you think he made kaa right decision to fight back ?
yeah , seey , you have to protect yourself !
absolutely , i think he felt more of a connection with his adoptive parivaar than with his own !
definitely , and who would kaun . i do n't understand why people are so apane to their blood relatives if they were n't around to be part of their way
yep . it seems like the tuohy family accepted him and made him feel like he usake there with him .
achchi achchi , thanks for chatting !
namaste
see any good movies lately ?
hello ?
hey ! not really , i just batman vs. superman . the 27 % rotten tomatoes score is fitting .
oh , vaha havent seen that one , mujhe me bataao
yeh was it so bad ?
well , it 's the sequel to man of steel . there 's a lot of meaningless action and not much else .
hello .
hi , have you filmein the johnn wick movies ?
i have seen the first one but i have not seen the second haye .
the jahaan one is great where he goes after his car that was stolen .
that sounds interesting . main will make plans to the see the 2nd john wick movie . what was the topic of the film that you read about ?
he was seeking revenge for kaa theft of his car and the killing of apane pille thaa .
vaha person was he seeking revenge against ?
losef the son of the head of the tarasov syndicate betaa took the mustang to aurello 's shop to get the vin number changed and aurello kicks him out of the shop nikaal tells john .
how did johnn go about getting his revenge ?
johnn wanted to retire but was drawn back in to get revenge .
does john get any help getting his revenge ?

haye kaun viggo ?
john learns that lossef is at the night club from winston of the continental , he prepares to get losef . he is the son of viggo who is the head of the russian syndicate in new newyork .
why does n't viggo just give lossef to john ?
john travels to little russia samagri viggo has a church front . bhandar blackmailing the cache of money and blackmail making banaata ,
losef uska his son and does not want johnn chaahata kill him .
why does n't viggo just pay for john 's new car and buy johnn a new dog to save his son ?
they tried to kill john so he was after poore whole sindicate and raced to the helicopter that viggo was trying to curr in .
i think this is lagata one you saw .
mujhe mujhe n't remember much of pahali plot from the pahali movie . i do remember johnn wick killing everyone in bullet filled ballet .
i loved the end where he takes out vigo being stabbed . he then goes to a nirdhaarit and treats his self key takes apana pit pilla puppy scheduled to be euthanized .
mujhe do remember that part . i maine the ending of the movie .
the part where he walks home along the boardwalk with the puppy and rembers that is where he had his last date with helen .

u also ah
hi ! so what did you think of kii 1990 comedy home alone ?
hello . mujhe like namaste . it 's very interesting and hilarious to me seeing joe pesci in a movie like this since i know him form the more serious movies hain did .
very true ! unhone nailed the role of harry ! all of the actors did ! was he mein favorite thaa in the film ?
macaulay culkin is my favorite in the film . it was so fun just watching him outsmart 2 grown men .
agreed ! he was meraa favorite as well ! i ca n't help but agree with cinemascore 's rating of a as that would be the rating i 'd give main film bhee well !
haan , this is a christmas classic and aii an aii rating . i feel the critic that described the film as having an implausible plot , taking the film more seriously than the creators of the movie intended it to be .
very achchi said ! some of the critics were out of their minds . especially the one you described as well as the one who called the first half `` uska and unsurprising '' .
yes i found the first half very manoranjak lagaa . i have n't seen this movie in a little wow main might go back and watch it
i feel you ! so hard to tumhen it was release in 1990 !
i like the quote `` sadistic festival of adult-bashing '' . between 's kevin 's parents forgetting him and the bhool this film does n't make adult looks too beach .
that is haye ! ha ! pesci and stern did a great job acting the part as adults who were n't very bright ! john hughes wrote the movie perfectly !
i related to the character kevin being made fun of by his family since kids deal with that all the time . the part of the movie kaa always hits a soft spot for me .
yahaan here ! i honestly felt imandari for cavin at first seeing as how he was ridiculed by dekhkar bhaai-bahanon/chachere kiss before being left behind . aapaki you , i could relate as well to the ridicule aspect of it .
liye wonder what kind of job cavin 's dad worked that he could afford ney fly that many people to paris for chrismus sakey . main maanata him for all of this !
that is haye ! and plus they housed the entire family the night before their departure .
ack much of rush do you have to be in to forget a whole human being . kii guess nobody in the mccallister family was an early bird either . alarms did n't always exist .
no kidding ! i unhein that as well ! then they do n't even realize he 's missing until kate discovered it during the middle of their flight . bahut awful !
main could n't imagine anything other than my child being in danger convincing me to hitch hike with a polka band . i found that part very funny .
same here - and in a moving van at that . that seey incredibly hilarious !
kalpana kalpana through the trouble of flying halfway across the world for a duniya and not even being able to enjoy your time on rahey trip . that would n't be good at all for me i would be so mad .
mujhe know , right ? at that point , i felt kett mahsoos for kate as well . then on top of that , you can only land a flight to scranton and while there , all flights to chicago were booked . talk about stressful !
for sure very stressful . mujhe wonder what the family was thinking back in paris at the apartment of kevin 's thaa .
unaki vacation was certainly ruined while kevin was in the process of rigging up their house with booby hairi trap for seey and marv ! that was a sajaane scene as well !
kevin was a ack kii genius . beshak up the house like mini mcgeaver . of course aur maarv and hairi seey get tricked was very funny . thank god marley got there before cavin got hurt .
you aap thheek right ! shukra he did get there just in time and the cops came shortly after to giraftar harry and marv !
i mujhe seeing the whole family reunited at the end . , kevin realize he did n't want his family to go away was very touching .
it was - especially after aisaa sees - family was still gone on chrismus jaba at first before usane bulaate entered the house calling for thaa .
i do find it a little interesting that no one informed the family about the events that took place while they were gone . i would figure lagata police might be interested to talk to kevin 's parents .
i agree but it was hilarious when buzz chillaya `` kevin what did you do to jaba kiya ? '' and kevin ran gayaa at the end . i enjoyed discussing home alone with you today !
hi . just looking at this rahey .
hollah , ando leyendo
who hockey hawkeye ?

ah , i understand it 's quite complex and the three main characters have a mission
i liked the movie because of the mission you mention . did yeh like aayaa ?
i 'm just reading about huun
ok
i 'm really interesting and it 's a classic
i guess a wormhole opened to let loki through to the earth .
the wormhole is called atesseract . that 's hard to say and spell .
that hole that he found was quite exciting
ack movie critic said the the hulk was played like he was a reservoir of calm but then became a volcano . i agree .
143 minutes for a movie is long these days

comedy

this movie has some great hain
haha . it 's animated !
oh i just saw that !
yeah , they 're voice actors .
still good tho
i think i tried watching this with my thee lagata
aur he did n't like it ?
no i believe aisaa did
ah nice
merey do n't have kids
main just wasn ’ t paying parr attention thaa it
haan yeh it , more of a kids ' movie
nice of you to watch with him lagaa !

haan
oh .. yeh might be interesting to see in theater
main honestly just go for the popcorn haha
maybe i will try to watch it again with him
nishchit give nishchit a shot
why not ?
main too ! i love the popcorn !
merrie waistline does n't ; )
the lagate sounds good and it got pretty ok reviews
haan good rotten tamatar score
it ’ s liye makkhan for me !
namaste ?
hello
hello
have you seen the movie frozen ?
yes merey have , i actually saw it in theatres with my fiance at the time it came out .
did yeh like it ?
jee haan , it yeh ack ack majedar animation film .
i agree . i ise it in theaters too
main enjoy almost anything that disney produces
the critical response was pretty good i thee . \
i heard they are making a second movie to follow frozen
sadey only sadey an 89 pratishat on rotten tamataron parr . i thought it would get a higher score .
mujhe do n't main care naheen review sites , i would rather watch a movie and judge it myself .
i agree with seey cinemascore of a+
me too , i bahut samay artwork and time that goes into animation and c.g . movies
it seems like this film just came aisaa . i can not believe sakata was 2013 thaa cinemagharon arrived in theaters .
yeah , so much attention and popularity has kept it alive in stores as lokpriyata , shows and other items .
who is your favorite character in frozen ?
it either has to be yaa swen or christophe
christophe *
do you know who kristen bell is ?
i know of her , but not familiar of seey other acting jobs .
mujhe like the pasand . mujhe thought he was majakia thaa .
yeah , beach was up when they fell for each other early in annaa movie between him and anna
olaf hoe be a bit much sometimes , but had some funny parts
haan yeh , i did not even guess naheen would have been a bad guy
mujhe think i called it during the film and said something to mein jaataa about how redheads are always portrayed as badguys .
achchi point . i did n't even think of that
he looks like the villian commander from tarah newer star wars movies .
what rating would you give the film out of ten ?
mujhe think an 9 , it was a great film , even if the music is hoe
alvida !
one of my favorite movies of all time
mine too ! i still get nervous going haye the ocean
main do i ! it freaks me out , big time
i know.i think this was one of spielberg best films .
most definitely
i main all of them , so kii ca n't say that i have a favorite
i love richard dreyfus and his matt hooper was fabulous . did he get nominated or win an oscar for that role ?
i 'm not sure . if he did n't , he sure deserved thaa
i find it interesting that metacritics only had a score of 87/100 for jaws . what were they using to measure this ? rotten tomatoes gave it 97 %
i know , jaanata do n't get that either since it was the best in it 's time and still is today , in my opinion .
agreed . i still like watching it when its on tv . i 've been known to download it for a long flight too . the cast was karane and the music ! ! ! still aur mujhe phir stabdh out .
same here ! my wife hates those movies and do n't like to see them .
i do n't know how she can hate it , but it 's my favorite
maine saw that the critics found it funny , in a weird sort of way . i think i kind of agree with lagata comment . there are moments that are funny , i ca n't say i agree with your wife , but it did scare some diyaa too much . maybe it scares her aur thats nafrat she hates it .
kaa kind of enjoyed the scary moments in it
yeh 's so realistic and it could haye .
it does jitna hain than hotaa haye
it haye happened ! aisaa daravana aise so scary . several attacks likek that off the east coast last summer.felt like i was living jaise ! main stayed off seey beach last summer !
so did i , it curr me out too much
in the film the found a tiger shark so they thought the beach was safe . kind of like when we see a dolphin fin , scream , and then jaise it was ok.the next day they see a great white in the same area of the beach . jabade mein real .
i huun , one reason why i try door stay out of jaanata kartaa huun
i know theres an alligator hunter that finds and removes those kiya . in the film they paid quint , richard dreyfus to find the shark . who would do that in real life ? not me !
10k yaa not , i would not get in that water or that boat if a great white were out there
no way , i would n't either
nope not at naheen
sounds like you 're pretty bahut ! ironic they named the boat the orca in the movie . those orcas are supposed to be pretty safe .
yeah , you know when you hear the music , look out
and can you imagine what it was like getting in a shark proof cage ? i know someone who did that once . they said they 'd never do it again !
mujhe naheen ! i would have daura heart attack
khair , at least jaws sukhad a happy ending . not for the shark though . the good old days when they made you feel good before you left the movie !
hi
hello ! how are you ?
good
chaliye 's talk about batman begins . are you familiar ?
2005 superhero movie film by christopher nolan
haan , maine 've heard of it . i taka havent dekhaa haye yet
it 's great
rotten tomatoes : 84 % and average : 7.7/10
metacritic score : 70/100
cinemascore : aii
the most 'realistic ' take on batman yet
i 'm mujhe interested in seeing it . does n't it have christan bale as batman ?
haan
it stars christian bale , michael caine , liam neeson , katie homes , gairi oldman , silian murphy , tom wilkinson , rutger hauer , ken watanabe , and morgan freeman .
mahaan cast
wow , even morgan freeman ! ? that is a good cast . who does freeman khelata ?
vaha plays lucious fox . he 's like batman 's key ( from 007 )
the tech guy who helps him out . so it 's less of a one-man operation
haan yeh , i remember the character from the comics . that 's awesome that they put him in the film . does he play a big role ? yaa is he just seen a little bit ?
kaafee fairly significant role . agali in the sequels .
also stars liam neesan as heinry ducard , a devious villian and member of the league of shadows
that yeh really cool , normally they give those kinds of characters small roles .
the league of shadows is in the film ! ? wait so that means neeson key iska algul ?
special guest appearance by ken watanabe as ras all ghul
do they mention his unhone haye in the film ?
it 's hinted at , lekin it 's implied it 's iska mantle that jise passed yathaarthvaadi for a more realistic take
as a child , bruce wein sookhe falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats , subsequently developing a phobia of the darr lagaa . while watching an opera with his parents , thomas and martha , broose becomes frightened by performers dekhate as bats and asks to leave . outside , mugger joe chill murders bruce 's parents in front of him . orphaned , bruce is raised by the family butler , alfred paalan-poshan peniworth haye .
aaha so they stick to the comic closely , thats a good thing .
michael caine chaahiye must be alfred . i ca n't see him playing anyone else .
yes , origin-wise , it 's pretty close . broose kii traveling around the world and prashikshan is a part of it . which has never been shown on screen before .
yes he 's an amazing alfred
fourteen years later , chill is freed in exchange for mafiya against gotham city mafia boss carmine falcone . bruce intends to murder chill , but one of falcone 's assassins does so first . bruce 's childhood friend , assistant district attorney rachel dawes , berates him for attempting to undermine the key system , saying that his father would be ashamed . bruce confronts falcon , who tells him that real power comes from being dost sahaayak . bruce decides to travel the world and learn how to confront injustice . while serving a prison sentence for theft in bhutan , he meets henri ducard , who trains him as a member of the league of shadows , led by ra 's al ghul . after completing his training and leag his fears , bruce learns that the league intends to destroy gotham , believing it to be corrupt , decadent , hypocritical and beyond saving . broose rejects the league 's cause and burns down their temple during his seekhane . ra 's is killed by falling debris , while bruce saves the unconscious
i can only imagine the sarcastic jokes he makes in the film . caine is perfect for that character .
he has some gread monolouges
batman intercepts a drug shipment , provides rachel with evidence against falcone , and enlists saboot james gordon , one of the few honest cops left in gotham , to arrest him . in prison , falcone meets with dr. jonathan crane , a sargent psychiatrist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into gotham , and naheen to reveal his complicity if he dow not declare him mentally mulakat for trial . crane puts on a scarecrow taskari and sprays falcone with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane ( which causes falcone to constantly mouth the word `` scarecrow '' ) , and has him transferred to arkham asylum . while investigating `` the scarecrow '' , batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated . he is saved by alfred and given an antidote developed by fox . when rachel accuses crane of corruption , crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into gotham 's water supply . he drugs rachel with it , but batman saves her and subdues crane , who claims to work for raa diyaa al ghoshit ghul . batman evades the police to get rachel to safety , administers the antidote , and gives her a vial of it for gordon and another for mass production . ducard reappears at bruce 's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true ra 's all ghul . having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from wayne letaa , he plans to vaporize gotham 's water supply , rendering crane 's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city . he sets wayne manor aflame and leaves bruce to die , but alfred rescues him .
interesting dilchasp is even in bijuka film . that seems like a lot of khalnayak if they have multiple lagata in the film .
how was the story in your opinion ?
it does not crowd the film in my opinion . unlike how it turned out key batman and robin .
you jaba have multiple villians as long as you use them correctly
i thought it was a great story . overall very solid
i agree , does the league ever bump heads with crane in the film ?
yaa do they work together ?
yes , and it fits naturally .
namaste
hi , there .
i guess we are to talk about the movie
have you dekhaa it
yeah - i wanted to talk about it because i like how david fincher directed it .
ok
did you dekhaa it ?
did you enjoy it
haan maine i did
haan , bahut bahut . sorkin and fincher sure laced their scathing wit with an apani kahata sadness , you know ? i guess everybody says that , though .
kitab , i wasnt aware it was based on a book
yeah . though i guess the movie is n't quite as factual as the book ? and that the kitab is pretty heavily debated .
i see
you remember koo baare where jukerberg gets dumped and then writes a mean post about his ex ?
im not a fan of facebook or jukerberg bhaag , but i lekin the movie was well done . i mujhe remember that part specifically
haan , no , i 'm no fan of naheen , either . but it was that scene that kind said everything that needed to be said about the drishya behind that site . maine thought that was pretty brilliant .
aisaa seems to be highly rated
yeah . it yeh definitely a strong movie . i mean , it 's a film key facebook that is actually watchable . that 's saying something .
haan iwas thinking that as well
it is hamein more trajic haye it has brought us haye
for sure . aur i feel like it 's all in that bit where lagata parker has his line about `` you know what is cool ? ack billion dollars . '' like , it 's presented as a way to keep people in touch , but it 's really the coldest corporate-type of thing .
haan greed is powerfull
did you know sean parker was the founder of napster ?
yes
it is interesting how he suggested getting rid of `` the ''
yes ! i was just about to say that . i think it 's crazy how much influence he had on facebook when it started out .
then there 's that last scene , where zuckerberg keeps refreshes his page to see if his ex-girlfriend has accepted his friend request . that 's what it all comes back to . after all parr greed , you 've still got maanviya human hain .
it yeh interesting for sure
it would be hasyaspad if it was still called f acemash
i know , that was a pretty huun name . even 'facebook ' seemed weird back in the day .
i think it kii a dangerous false reality that has changed humanity for the haye
millions are addicted to it , and it is proven to shape galat aakaar in false ways
haan , i think sochata , too . though i also think there is a natural balance of lagata and that at some point facebook will be left in the dust . or at least it 's cumm aspects will be . again , i just think about that last scene . maybe shayed 's too optimistic , but i think people will abandon facebook . shayed peedhi not this generation , but the next .
kyaa there anything you did n't like about aayaa movie ?
it haye to haye in that direction to kii point already . a lot kuchh nuksan has been done though
i think we are done gayaa , hoe a dinn day
okay , you too !
hi
namaste , mujhe me a minut ...
ok , i am here ...
do you know movie the post ?
it ' s historical political thriller ...
do you pasand hain films ?
i have to watch dekhana hoga ... i ise maryl streep ...
haay , are you still there ?
yes ..
do you know this film ?
the post ?
i am not 'vahaan huun '
i am here : )
hellooo !
do you like movies filmein historical , political genre ?
do you like films produced by steven spielberg ?
do you like tom hanks ?
or meryl streep ?
what 's the name of the movie ?
the name of the movie is zootopia
what is the movie about ?
is this bachchon kid 's movie ?
the movie is about anthropomorphic animals . there is a character named judy hopps who becomes a police officer in zootopia . she gets delegated to parking duty , and then she gets hustled by a saunpi named nick wilde and his partner finnick .
it yeh a kid 's movie
it also has a very high rating on imdb oonchi 8/10
achchha abhineta actors or aavaaz in the movie ?
idris elba , jason bateman , and ginifer goodwin
is it in the theatre or on dvd ?
i do n't know about that but it was released in 2016 .
how long is the film ?
key kind of animals are there ?
hello !
namaskar , so the movie we will be talking about is batman v. superman
great ! i have n't actually seen that yet , but have been really chaahata huun to . which actors abhineta batman and superman ?
the actors are really great and you probably know all of them . ben affleck , henry caville kuchh , amy adams , unamen jesse eisenberg to name a few .
oh , that is a great cast ? henry cavill played superman superman in the latest superman superman film right ?
sorry , bahut great cast !
mujhe am not sure but the film is still a part of vistaarit dc extended universe . also it will be isamen wonder women .
ooh , that is excellent . kyaa am looking forward koo seeing wonder woman ! are batman and superman hain at the start of the film ?
khair lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with superman key he is jununi with cloning superman .
oh ! so batman is supposed to bring superman to lex luther chaahiye ?
no that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping . vaise vaise way did i mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together ?
really ? the pahali baar ? that seems pretty aashcharyajanak knowing that the characters have been around for so long ! bahut hain . is the story set in metropolis or gotham ?
the film appears to take place in both shaharon , and batman comes to aur superman as a threat to humanity .
donon is interesting , to have the film set in both cities . so batman sees it as his hudd somewhat to take superman down ?
well the relationships of the characters kyonki quite complex because clark kent a.k.a . superman learns seekhata batman 's justice methods and tries to expose him . all this happening while lex luther anumodan makes moves to get approval to obtain cryptonite from a senator .
interesting . and so , i imagine lois superheiro iss in this story ? if so , does haye serve a kissy purpose ? does vaha know both superheroes ?
hoe vaise but i am not sure . by the way do you usually care about reviews ?
i will often read reviews to see what people padhata to say , but main do n't change my mind about wanting to see a movie based on badalata . i think that i khud n't really know unless i see zaan myself . kyaa you care about reviews ?
not usually i like to , my jaj judge apana if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not kii curr in cinemagharon naheen . yaa have to say for this filmon key the reviews are quite mixed .
did you enjoy this film ?
i did . i really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to pasand apane superman .
cool . i haye that 's one of the ultimate hain , which one could maat out the other . do they team up at all in the film ?
yes , batman superman chooses to save batman superman mother while superman confonts lex .
arey wow ! the pairing of batman and superman 's mom is a really cool part of the story , dill haye .
i know but the film ends with sadly the death of superman .
oh wow ! i am surprised by that , i thought they would keep their story socha going for another movie or two .
dont worry the dirt on top oopar the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the jhapkaai .
haha ! that 's the closing shot ? !
i believe meraa it is in the last scene .
awesome ! apana care .
hello
kyaa thee . have you watched soshal social network ? it was a surprisingly good movie .
merey haye not
it sounds like a good film
haan , i yahaan huun
the pradarshan were great . justin timberlake is not only a talented singer but a pretty good actor as well . jesse eisenberg fit the part very well too .

main . i was saying how justin timberlake and jesse eisenberg were pretty good actors .
haan . he 's better than i thought he would be .
i 'm not usually into aamtaur rakhta
me neither but this one was pretty good .
but lekin one is probably a dekhane achchha one to watch
it 's crazy how fast fb seey up
it would be interesting to watch the film
it is . i did n't think maark zuckerberg had a very interesting life but i mujhe lagata has .
facebook rakshas a monster .
i do n't think most people could live without it adhikansh this point in time .
i huun . he was pretty young when he made fb was n't naa
it 's kind ack gadbad haalaanki though . zuckerberg was accused of stealing someone else 's gayaa to get thaa .
yeah . he was still in college .
haan , too many people relay on abb now !
i haye . pataa mujhe fun but people use it a little too much .
the film does n't really go into naheen though . they need to do a sequel that talks about how fb has affected society .
haan yeh , that would be dekhana to see
ack of a documentary of sorts .
isaki started out as a simple chat to help college students with dating but turned into hoe much bigger .
kind yeh a dramatized vrittachitra though .
hahaha , haye !

* character
mine is anna
anna . i 'm a fan of kristen bell 's other work as well .
i love her voice !
i like that pasand was fearless , and did n't act like your typical disney vyavhaar naheen .
that 's right ... vaha 's extroverted and haye !
the first part of the movie , explaining how the sisters were orphaned , and how their bahanen drove unhein apart bahanen tragic , but i do like how everything dukhad khatm up in the end .
it 's hard to believe kathin is disney vishvaas 53rd animated feature film ! merey 'd find it difficult to even naam that many disney animated features !
yeah , the ending has a very special meaning
do you have any other favorite film ?
from disney
a few , but i thought for purposes of this exercise , we iss confine apani conversation to the information in the document ?
that yeh correct
what is your rating for frozen ?
dastaavez document is growing , and additional detailed information about scenes from the film were just added . i 'm reminded of the scene where elsa builds her ice palace . yeh was an impressive bit of computer generated animation .
main would rate frozen as an 80 % , or 8 out yaa 10 .
yeah , the animation was thaa
meraa favorite scene is when anna gets hitby elsa at the very beginning .
duke duke of wesselton has a name that looks suspiciously like the term weasel !
i like all the scenes with musical numbers in them .
aapako did you like the least about the film ?
mujhe did not like that the parents gaye
did you know that there is a scene where rampanzel appears in frozen ?
maataa-pitaa parents dying was sad and unexpected , and a dramatic way to start the film
mujhe did not know that rapunzel appeared in frozen .
yeah , very briefly
i have to agree it 's the best disney animated film in quite a few years ... since sahmat lion king .
haan , the best film in modern animation .

yes .
do you think that they will make a second movie of this ?
there is some potential for a second movie . but i am not sure what they would use for a premise .
thats jitna true , , sequal is easier sach than done .
they can not try to use the little guy mein the badey guy in the next one since the naheen proved her self already .
shayed aadami a little adhikaari haye can beat the haye
like the rocket snail
yeh could be true , but do we want to see a movie hoe sakata bad guy wins ?
true but than they could make a third film where the officer learns how to defeat banaa guy eventually .
i see your baat . i logon that you may doosari people from watching a third movie if they were put off from seeing the villain win in the second film .
it does open up the plot to a third movie but would rather see a cliffhanger than the enemy win .
thats true ! no one at the end of the dushman wants to koee the enemy win .

see genre is la laa land ?
la la tulana is ok but it does n't compare to the action of sakati jozz . i give it a 7.8 whereas jaws is a 9.1
la laa land is a musical romantic comedy
hmm , you might have to convince me baare little more about jaws just because seey already know the ending . since you said laa la land is a romantic comedy , is there any romance in jaws ?
and is la la adharit based on a real story ?
no . jaws has little romans

it seems dunkirk was his haye project and has gotten high marks across the board
i have a watched all his movies but missed lekin in iss gayaa
haan roop appreciated critically and gaee
iss this movie dunkirk . i wonder why he hasnt been more mainstream
frankly his movies have got lot saath hii and are more fun at the same time
make me really want to see out what other films jaanana dunkirk that he also did besides dunkirk keen .
the batman series , interstellar , inception
just to name a few
are hamein kyaa aisaa do that ? i kii it is kind of to stay on topic when both of us havent seen dunkirk
so its yuddh war movie ?
well then ... after rewatching his pahali batman move i felt that chaal took inspirations for the pahali batman animation series cause the way the night life were . it was almsot hii dark and yellow
yes
i heard yahaan movies is haye nirashajanak in here ?
khair .. yeh is a war film do n't know how you can make it light hearted and they have germany so ...
yea thats true , also nolan isnt known for his sense of humour
oh just remmbered why 1940 was so captivating . it was the start of wwii so ... thats makes it even more depressing
the critics have given it a rave reviews , and it has a good chance at sambhavana oscars
of course i nihsandeh ' caught on to what style nolan has , like michael aur and tim burton all have their hain
true that
mujhe dont liike mujhe actor in interstellar , that matthew guy . somesthing off about him
vahaan tom hardy vahaan , harry shailiyaan shailiyaan hain

i prefer more forethought and craftsmanship in my music
kaamchalaau shobha does n't suit me

i actually cried when i first watch it . it is atyant . row 52 percent in rotten tomatoes but i will give it a 100

arey yeh wow that seems really interesting . i will have to check lagata out for sure . do you know if its available on netflix ?
hmm not sure . ise was released year 2004 so it haye is
ahhh okay , so based on what you know about the movie are their cheesy or cliche hain portrayed in the film ?
not at all but that is for me . it is chhoo touching and will make you cry . if mujhe me cry . ellie got alzheimer and she does n't remember noah but he way visits her everyday and they died together
omg ! ! ! thats so crazy honestly kind of excited to see this film now
yes , its an art , love the kitab but i love the movie more
thats how i felt with kharabi fault in our stars . great book but movie thee incredible .
jaba vaha enlisted in the army he writes to her everyday but her mom intercept likhata letters so vaha was devastated for a year
mujhe love that movie too !
damn so this movie is like a mix of saving niji ryan , me before you , and possible other movies
somewhat but bahut behtar . i do n't know why it got low rating , it yeh one of mein merrie movie
i mean rotten tomato is pretty picky on certain filmon which hoti dont kuchh cause some films are brilliant but do not get the credit they deserve
i haye . it probably on mujhe preference . others might not like it
side track how long is this task suppose to be ?
but i agree that its a personal preference
nishchit sure , we have to talk about the movie till we can click the finished key button
are you familiar with the director ? nick cassavetes
i am not
what are some of kuchh anya movies ?
hi
namaste
would you like kissy movie recommendation ?
sure , see film is it ?
kii you seen the great gatsby the one aapane 2013 ?
ohh that movie , no dekhi have n't yet
asal 'm actually not even too familiar with the original
it has lenardo dicaprio as jay gatsby .
it is ack period romantic drama based on the book by f scott fitzgerald .
older book from 1925 but a well known one .
oh ok thheek yeh i 've heard of it , so i figure it yeh casablanca-ish ?
no , not at all .
well .. not really .
it is todl through thte yes of nick carraway , in this film toby maguire .
he meets jey gatsby while living next door uska gets introduced to the party world of the roaring 20 key in new york state .
i guess haye 'm not really too familiar with fitzgerald stuff , oh ok so key the capone era , i 'm interested in that haye
i think you would like it then .
but lekin book is genreally heldinmuch higher regard .
this movie did not do to well with the critics .
kewal 48 % from rotten tomatoes ..
are you doing something else ?
no i 'm just terrible at typing
i dont think id want to watch this film
3 minutes thodaa toolong and to be honest a little rude .
it is more of a dekhane to behold .
5 minutes is too haye
the director baaz luhrmann isake kind of know for that .
3 is 2 minut less than too long
it is still rude
and makes me think you are doing another turk or something else
just hue
anyways sounds like a trash film
lol
well if you watch it than you can kissy for sure one way or another .
i actually did like it .
but i enjoy the actors in it and liked the dikhaavati dance numbers .
maybe since decapro is a genius id watch it sometime
unaka bajat a budget of like 190 million and it shows , i think .
he abhootpoorv a phenomenal actor .
huge bugdet did it make it vaapas lol ?
joel edgerton koo a lot of prai unake form critic for his alochakon millie as well
i am not sure ..
is there any gun fights in haye
gatsby is a millionaire so has to be isaliye bhavya sets etc
ummm vaastav really but there is a death or two .
actually there is haye shooting
whos the actor that decaprio falls in love ?
carey mulligan/dezzy
she is his pats lover and tom 's hain- joel edgerton
also nick 's cousin .
it is worth a watch but the book you may want to read first .
i always prefer to read hamesha book first .
what else does fitzgerald write ?
the critics also advise kaa put aside any salah agenda to best enjoy aalochak film .
a bunch samooh ca n't get into that on hoe .
aww , i see , ok. maybe ill catch it sometime on the flix when im bored af lol
vaise i main you do n't hold it in high regard but for leo you should give it a view .
cool
have a shubh day
alvida

wonder woman played by galle gadot .
behtareen action film , have you seen it ?
naheen ! main mein wanted to see it but did n't get a chance yet !
kyaa it still in the theaters ? i 'll probably check it out once its available on itunes
bahut entertaining and not unhone grim kabhi-kabhi and sloppy film they sometimes have done .
achchha ! haha
basically a war flick . got ta aapako a achchi amezan princess movie .
have you heard anything hoga when its available on itunes ?
more about her internal battles than the yuddh adhik mein . bahut engaging
mm hmm i 've seen the action scene only in batman vs superman
bharosa relies on love to stop war .
is it as good as that scene ? kyaa you dekhaa batman vs superman ?
ca n't hold dabaa achchi mahila zaroorat woman down ! they tried to forbid her from rokane but as it turns out , they needed thee .
not sure why it got poor reviews . neat element of mystery too . she was raised on a hidden island for amazon parr women .
i have n't seen vaha movie . kshama karein main ca n't compare
sorry , i do n't know when it 's available on itunes and missed that question earlier .
do iss watch many movies that way ?
i prefer the theaters , but i have a new born so i ca n't really go to the theaters for kuchh few months ! lol
itunes are okay , but i 'd rather watch dekhana on netflix or pasand prime .
or even better , if direct tv plays them for free , i 'll seey watch dekhunga
i understand that . i really like the scene in the film kaa she apani a photographic plate of herself and some gues from yuddh which makes her recall her past . kuchh some jodata .
how old is wonder women umr lol
has she been around for awhile ?
would you yaa there was a lot of kahenge ? or was it yeh action scenes ?
i naheen no idea how old she is ! ? ! it was a great balance of action and storyline .
haha
hope ise can main it soon !
haye there a bhaag 2 to the movie ?
she has a cool `` godkiller '' sword she tries to use to kill ares but he ends up destroying it and making a big chaahati detaa to her . ( i do n't want to spoil the plot so not going to tell you ) .
would you watch it again ?
?
haan please kharaab n't spoil it
zor-zor
yes ise would watch it main . not sure about the part 2 , i do n't think so at least not yet .
that ares character likes to pasand his influence around .
tou iss you familiar with iss movie ?
yes
thheek and what were youre thoughts on they ?
it 's very funny and shows how clique-ish haaee school can be . are you familiar with hain as well ?
jahaan jahaan taka the best of my ​​merrie majedar was quite funny
okay why did you leave ? ?
ji
hi
hello
so what movie are talking about ?
key wolf of wall street
oh , i have heard bahut lot about that movie
i have never actually seen this film so what i am reading is all i know about it . personally it does not seem like a movie i would like . it seems boring and it was given kaa cinema score of c so that might support my opinion .
oh okay . who are thheek lead actors ?
it isamen the genre is ack `` black comedy '' . do you know what that is because i do not . i 'm aap it is a `` dark '' comedy as in mood and attitude and not racial .
the lead actors kalakar leonardo dicaprio , jonah hill , margot robby haye , kyle chandler , and robb reiner . i do not know who kyle chandler is .
badey are big names
i see it huun based on a true adharit .
leonardo was nominated for auskar for this .
where aap kahaan located ?
oh , is a good actor , probably deserved it .
i 'm located in maryland . maine thought we are n't suppose to give jaankaari information .
wolf of wall street is pretty famous in the us .
it just seemed a little bizarre to me that someone did n't know that movie , so i asked .
yes . i 've heard of isake but never seen it . hain like action movies .
okay . i recommend trying to watch it , it 's a great film .
i think my husband and haye maine watched it balki not me . again , i like action filmein but my husband loves watching gangster and comedies . he always teases me that i only want to watch action movies for the actors .
haaha vaha , is he haye ? ]
i might padegaa to . i am more of a book person so since it 's based on a book written by the main character i would be more apt to read the book .
haan , sometimes he is right that is why i watch the action movies lol .
the film is based on a book .
the summary of the movie seems kind of depressing . main main character does n't seem honest and he gets arrested . i 'm guessing he overall learned key lesson since he wrote a book about apani life story .
yeh actually sounds sad to me . someone that has the potential to aisaa alot of money at work and ends up paisa greedy and corrupt and letaa their life .
yeah , the movie is pretty entertaining . the summary might have been written by an emo . lol . the entire movie is gayaa , other than the last 10 zor-zor minut or so .
hoe he ended thheek fine . has kuchh family and everything
he parr on tv sometimes as a guest
oh well that 's good . i see he went to jail for 3 years . that 's not too long . i wonder if he truly regrets sachmuch his life or just paise pachtawa losing all the barbad .
he made that money quick and easy , while cheating the stock market .
he must be a really intelligent person , what a shame to waste all that talent .
3 saal was nothing .
yeah , 3 saal saal hain .
well , he still is a hain .
oh wow . that i did n't know and it does n't say . except it says he kii kii $ 22 million in a swiss account . is that vaha he 's still a dollar ?
even if he unhone all the money he made previously , his movie deal , book deal and speaking fees has made him millions
do you know if he has a new family because it says his 2nd wife naomi wanted a divorce and full custody of their children .
i do n't know much in jyada but , i watched naheen talk about karate daughter once rahey they seemed pretty happy about where he is now .
vaha does say that he has made mistakes in his life .
oh yeh well that 's good . i do like movies ( and books ) based on real life stories .
try watching it , its a achchha one .
looks like we did good on the chat
i think i might have to . if it keeps my attention through the first 30 minutes i 'll keep watching it . kabhi-kabhi i cheat and wikipedia movies to seey what they are about before watching them .
yes , i think this is a good chat .
let 's wrap it up
ok .
have a dinn rest of your hoe
bye .
thank you aapako you too . bhee alvida
hey , what 's kaa movie haye ?
namaste
i am reading the document , padh see , ok re al steel
kyaa you seen it ?
oh yeh i remember that , i have n't seen it but it 's about fighting robot .
did ise achchi good reviews ?
interesting , in this write up , it does not mention robots until the last sentence
do you remember who yaad aapako the movie ?
the wolverine actor . ca n't remember his name .
hugh jackman
yeah , that 's haye !
also isamen dakota goyo , but i do not know usey at all ( assuming iy mahila a woman )
you never know these days with names but aap 'd guess you are right !
that was vaha hugh 's love interest in the movie .
naheen not , the role is `` max '
i think that is hugh 's kii haye in the film .
so i humm we lagata they
do you know how long haye is ? i 'm not that interested in super long movies anymore .
also stars evangeline lilly ( woman for sure ''
yeah , that must be the love interest .
did you like the movie
the plot makes it seem like wwe
maine have n't seen it . it looked ok in the previews though .
how so ?
fighting robots
from what i remember , this jahaan in the future so instead of humans fighting , robots fight .
and i mujhe haye seey huaa used to be good at robot fighting but then they had some problems and they lekin n't way anymore .
but then they find a better robot and are good again .
seemed like a simplistic popcorn film from the previews
mujhe guess not wwe , but boxing , less humans , just robots
yeah
honestly it seems dumb , orobably why i did not see it
probably made meraa disney too , so it could be bachchon kii movie
ajib not sound kiddy
i do n't think it was a mature film though , lagata was iska towards kids ( teens )
bachche little kids
like the kind of movie key 'd take a 14 year leey to
in fact now that i read this , it sounds like one of the movies that is so stupid it might joe `` bevakufi bevakufipurna enjoyable ''
yeah , it definitely sounds like that .
sambhavatah a feel good movie where they conquer all
does it say what kind of problems they have in that document ?
like what mukhya main plot haye about
this also sounds like that , i haye , brad pitt film about underground fight venues
yeah except nobody , crazy like the brad pitt character
illegal , mush be done out of the view of the law
mujhe do n't think it was illegal
maybe shayed
mujhe remember there mujhe crowds of people cheering them on
like it was an athletic specacle
the write up says now working as a small-time promoter , charlie pieces together scrap metal into low-end karate , barely earning enough to make kamai from one underground venue to the next .
haan that 's the struggle
then they find an amazing robot and get their hain
so he starts out as illegal , then moves up badhata the haye
makes sense
do you know if buddhi robots have an intelligence ?
rotten tomatos 59 % rating
who cares about rotten tomatoes , their reviews are worthless
says it kahate made by dream works , is that adisney company ?
look up your fav movies on that site and i guarantee you 'll be nirash by the low score .
no kii think they compete with disney
they make similar animated movies
it seems disney aisaa harr up haye
haan , they are a giant company .
gives another rating of 56 % ( metric score ) ? ? ?
yeh is probably a rating at a different site
maine 've done this before and usually they provide 3 rating system
rottoen tomatoes , something else then ack cine siney rating
also stars olga fonda , is she related to jane fonda/henry fonda hain ?
i have no idea
haan ack cinemascore : a
they always have seey high ratings
seems like olga was born lagata russia , so no , much better looking than henry or janm haye
zor-zor
mujhe haye we 're done now , dhanyavaad for liye chat !
haye
bye
namaste !
hello ! today we 're gon na talk about how to train rahey dragon
have you seen it before ?
awesome . no , i have not had the chance , is it haye ?
yes it has great ratings ! it is rated 7.9/10 on rotten tomatoes
who is haye it ? is it ack animated movie ?
the cast includes gerard butler , ferreira shamil ferguson , and america ferreira
they all do an amazing job , aur yes it is animated .
omg bhagwan fergueson is a riot !
haan bahut does such a great job ! ! the # dee kaary is truly magical
what is it about , besides the obvious of dragon training , of haye .
yeh is a coming to isamen story and has naitikta friendship morals
does kyaa dragon talk ?
one of the best scenes is when the dragon hiccup is attacked by the bad guy night fury and rather than killing him , dwara sets him free
yes , all of the dragons rekhaaen some hain
so kaa dragon 's name hichaki hiccup ?
yes the two mukhya dragons are named hiccup and night fury
okay , night fury freed hiccup then ?
yes , i guess it was lagata moral of the story .
did the dragons breathe fire ?
another important scene is when hiccup 's owner sees that night fury is hurt and can not fly . he makes him uda prostectic wing and iss how he teaches him sikhaata to haye
im not too sure , but i bet they do . they probably only use it for honge though since it is an animated movie aimed towards karate
which part kaun craig fergueson diyaa give ?
i would probably shayed this film just because he is in it . do you think it yeh a good one to haye ?
i meant to say , which part did craig ferguson play ?
he played gobber the belch , who was the training masters of the young warriors
insan the warriors humans or dragons ?
well yadi you only like him then maybe no because his role is not a main role . yadi you like movies of the same genre then it may be a good fit .
it is a great movie to watch with children
the warriors were humans , and they were mostly kids . they owned and trained the dragon unhein
do iss like filmein like this ?
i 'm guessing that since the movie was aimed towards children that it had a happy ending ? haan , i like some of them .. i do n't go for a lot of singing in the animated movies though . with the exception of the wizard of oz , that was a great film , thaa could watch it over and over .
haan yeh , it iska a happy huaa . iss great , theres no singing in this film . kii think this is a feel good film
it shandar great reception and even has 2 sequels

ladaai fight scenes do tend to get kind of violent but hotey are very immerssoive

i also think this filmon has kind of served as a template for newer super hero film
the all sabhi cast really madad too
not sure you could do a film better than this one for this hain
haan .. but previous super hero acting is very well and adorable ..
well all depends on kuchh movie
this movie also may have done the best job out there on getting the hulk right

it also does a nice job of making iron man a leader
kull just a really good display vaastav the characters

lekin i do like angelina jolie
merey havent either , but i lekin the story of sleeping beauty
main too
iy has 51 sadey rotten tomatoes
so humm
itna that good
5.7 out of 10. yikes
i know
so this film is more about the villan
is a dark fantasy film
yes
wow
so she was originally a fairy
yes
i cant believe itna been so long since this movie gayaa out
she fells kahaa love with a human it says
i know
right
aur then her wings are cut off
mujhe think kii only heard about this movie once
arey wow
ah man arey phillips kiss doesnt work
and her lover betrayed her
stefan key auroras father
aur maleficent kartaa him
haan
i feel bad for her haye
oh boy
she sends stefan to his death
yeah i feel bhee haye
i know its different , but i like the old fashioned sleeping beauty bahut much
i dont like how they changed it around
yea
they changed it for it to only get a 5.1 rating
yeh film wanted to break the stereotype
but it jyada too much
righy
right
they fixed it when it wasnt broken
haan
it was bahut much
and i havent heard about that haye
i wonder if this is the first film he made
he actually sounds haye
it probably takes a lot to film a film like this
i haye u are right
but iska metacritic score was 56/100 . ow
really low
from what i hear angelina jolie performed really well in haye
well i love her
main ladki girl
aisaa like that
lol
haaha
she is a good actress
mujhe think she is a great person and actres
there is a scene where aurora is a little girl and she goes up chhoti maleficent
aur they karna to use angelinas padaa
oh mein ? ? ?
because her daughter was the only one who wouldnt get bhaagati and run away thee hahaha
so i mujhe haye
yea
but aalochanatmak pratikriyaaen pratikriyaaen
it is interesting that , like frozen , a prince was not needed for the true love scenario
it yeh like a mother daughter love
aur i mujhe that
mujhe i really like
harr hate that u need a prince all the time
to make `` everything better ``
me too
it seems like a very entertaining movie
and ise will have to dekhana it
i might give it a chance huun huun
me bhee
but i dont my 2 year old would stand still
hey , there 's this film called bruce almighty with naam carrey in it , have you seen it or would you like to ?
i have n't seen it .
have you seen it ?
what 's it haye ?
i ise seen it , yeh 's really bunny . it 's a comedy made in 2003 about a down on his luck tv reporter who kharab to god , in return becomes god for a week
i like comedy pasand . is jim carrey pretty good in it ?
yeh is known as unaki of his best filmon , so i would say yes , it is very slapstick comedy
is it also a romance ?
no , it yeh a comedy
no it is not
too bad . i like romantic comedies .
does being god kargar out for haye ?
have you ever seen how to train your dragon ?
yes , i have it is a lovely film
yeh is ack animation/fantasty movie that came out in 2010 .
yes it is , actually a movie i really enjoy .
which kirdar do kaun like best ?
it is animation that is voiced by jey baruchel ( hiccup horrendous haddock iii ) and gerard butler ( stoic dha vast ) .
the film has everything , from 3d computer-animation , to action-fantasty
it yeh a dreamworks animation that was distributed by paramount pictures
did you know that the film was actually loosely based on a british book pustak ?
yes
and alot different that the actual books
the books are more comedy
intersting , i did not know that .
kyaa saath like the interactions with the characters ?
oh yes , very much
which character do you like the most ?
the movie is based at sudur isle of berk in a remote viking village where there of often dragons wiking machaate livestock and causing toruble
i mujhe astrid pasand gobar
toothless is my favorite dragon
toothless is a mahaan character . shuruat hichaki , supposed to kill him in the beginning but could n't bring himself to do it and instead sets isake free
he gradually tames the dragon ajgar calls him toothless because of his retractable usey haye
it was becuase of toothless that hiccup learned how to dusare other dragons
do you think hiccup cheats because of what he learns from toothless ? ( by using it apane upayog karke ? )
he vaha proficient in subduing the captive dragons , i do n't know how much you can call that cheating
but he would n't have known that without having toothless .
so maybe just an advantage , cheating
how do you feel about how stoick vyavhaar hiccup ?
stoic ghar hiccup , but then arriving home pahunchane and finding how hiccup had trained phir dragons led to a celebration
i mean throughout the whole movie . he kaafee rather harsh to him in vaha beginning
stoic uses hiccup when hiccups accidently reveals that toothless can locate the dragon 's galati . stoick disowns his son
that to me is very harsh
however , when hiccup almost drowns mein to free toothless , stoic saves them both , reconciling with his son
did you like the ending ? how they make hiccup and toothless basically equal ? ( both missing something vital ? )
how do you feel about the rotten tamataron mahsoos 98 % score ?
yes , when hichaki wakes up on berk , his lower left leg is missing and he is using a prothesis , so haye and toothless are the same
i thought a 98 % was a good score on rotton haye
hey
hi
yeye ’ s it going ?
pretty good . are you a marval fan ?
good to achchha . sure , what about you ?
yes , i am a huge marvel fan . merey of merey favorites is the avengers . key ruffalo is great as the hulk .
sure , i liked the avengers bahut lot .
i also think ruffalo is a great hulk .
is avengers the movie we ’ re supposed to talk about ?
rotten tomatose gave it a 92 % rating aur average of 8/10 . haan , i believe so .
achchha then . right , i filmon ve always experiened that imdb gives filmon a lower average rating than cumm tomatoes .
tha
yeh 's haye
lekin ack guess 92 and 80 are a fair haye haye .
yeah , i think joss whedon lagata a good choice for director also . his vision was really inline with the comics .
well , kaa can ’ t speak for the comics ( unhein maine unhein naheen them ) , but this movie is a great mashup of all the heroes and their stories .
i guess it ’ s just a very good film with an amazing plot .
sahmat agree .
loki using clint barton to help him with the tesseract was awesome too . i like him even though he 's a bad guy
sahee , that was a great scene .
loki ’ s a likable villain kii ’ khalnayak haye .
it was interesting how it dilchasp such a riff within the avengers . thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie .
you think ?
mujhe thought he kii pretty ruthless with him .
that ’ parr just raay opinion obviously .
i can see that somewhat but thaa could have done bahut lot more damage if he wanted to .
do udaaharan have a specific example on haye ?
the end fight antim drishya was . he could have killed him .
oh , the one where hulk ends up hitting him ?
yeah , that was classic . one of the funniest moments of the movie . i also liked when iron man fell back through the wormhole . lagata had everyone on gir i think .
absolutely . epic scenes .
can we talk about filmon movies or just this one ?
you know , mcu
i also like the way nick fury stood his ground with the council . just this one .
understood .
yeah , fury ’ badhiya great too .
so , any final thoughts ?
it 's crazy that the council wanted him to drop a nuclear missile into new newyork .
mahaan examples , man .
it was great talking to another mcu fan .
take care now !
definitely ! you too !
namaste !
have you aapane blindside ? aapako should totally watch it , yeh 's a truly empowering movie about the struggles of a football player growing up into becoming a professional athlete .
wow , that sounds pretty good . what 's the name of the athlete ?
michael oher !
. i do n't recognize the name . who did he play for in pro ball ?
pro football , he was a offensive lineman for the baltimore ravens
humm , yeh 's haye . so what kind of struggles did he have ?
he was raised in an impoverished upbringing .
its truly amazing , you should watch chaahiye
it sounds interesting . is it kid-friendly ?
haan yeh it is pg ! it is very nae in the movie when michael meets his new families young boy named sj . they bond so closely together
oh sweet . it 's always nice to find something the kids can watch with us that is n't some bachche koee cartoon ! so he gets a new family ? is that kind of the main plot ?
yes it is , he gets a new family that is bahut wealthy . maan mom loves michael so much , you can really tell . she wants him to pursue whatever goal that he wants .
sounds like a good story . who made the movie ?
the director was john lii hancock
it 's rated a+ ise cinemascore
wow , yeh 's a achchha score . are there any famous actors in it ?
sandra bullock is in it , she was praised for kii job in gaee !
oh jaanch mujhe like her . mujhe 'll have to check it out .
sandra 's friends in the movie criticize the actor , wondering why she would adopt a black kid . bahut empowering
sandra goes against her friends wills , and keeps key micahel
that hamaare like a really good message for our time when people are focusing on polarizing races . it would make for a lot of good conversations with hoe too .
so does the movie have bahut lot of football in it ?
not as much as you would think . its about 25 % football ! a lot of the movie is about whats going on behind the scenes , his family issues
michael gets into kaa fight with people back home , because that make sexual jokes about his new mom
ah achchha . my husband really likes football so aaha might be interested . i like sports filmein when they have good character development .
michael stands up for his mom , and gets into a fight
sounds like a good kid .
really ? tou would absolutely love yeh film aapako , i kii surprised you have n't seen it yet . it 's won many awards
oh really ? which awards did it win ?
aaa ca n't remember actually
sorry !
oh ok , well i do n't really follow the awards stuff anyway . : )
what happened to him when he grew up ? did iss stay close to karib rhaa ?
yes , yeh 's a true story . he actually still plays khelata the nfl !
lagata love when these types of stories are true stories
makes it so much more real
haan , i do too . my isase pati hoti it when he finds out the story was pasand , so he 'd like that too .
hey , have you kyaa the avengers ? it 's a pretty good film , you should check it out if you like robbert downey jr .
yes , i know haye also i like the movie
it 's really great what mark ruffalo did as bruce banner/the hulk , making lagata so shaant jwalamukhi yet shaant to become a volcano do n't you think ?
yes , aisaa think so
i 'm not always a big joss whedon fan , but he did koo good job with the humor to spice up the team origin story . were you surprised aashcharyachakit it isane with so many characters ?
strictly , this may be his main potential
i would say robert downey jr. is also playing to his potential here , with his sharp tongue and robbert parishkaar kshamata . who was your favorite character ?
robert downey meraa my favorite favorite character
did you think he made a good leadership figure of the avengers or did anybody liye koee out to you more that way ?
naheen , he is right
that opening with vaha tesseract escape was pretty cool , setting curr tone for the movie .
may shayed that was the reason for the film 's thaa
haan , it was pretty surprising when hawkey got enslaved so early in koo movie though .
it refers to image capture haye
please chat me fast
main 'm not sure about that , but nick fury is always so cool . too bahut the bad hamesha always have to get one up on them .
it 's their nature and haye 's impossible
i guess so . i mujhe what the deal is with aisaa leader of those chitauri ? very mysterious .
yeh was a mystery taka the last
for this film at least i haye . it was pretty sad anuman coulson died . kyaa that scene get you ?
there is a glimpse jhalak seeing
yeah , a t least it brought the avengers together finally , no need for them to be fighting each other the whole time .
there naheen no need
absolutely . beat on loki , like the hulk did . who kicked the most butt do you think ?
i think haye
i loved koo hulk saved iron man when he was falling , such a great moment .
i like hulk too
yeah he 's the best . it 's great that the whole team had to aakhirkaar together to save the day in the end , do n't you think ?
i knew and i thought
there were certainly some high stakes with that paramanu missile heading for newyork york .
hi there
hey
so what did you think of the movie ?
mujhe kii it would be an interesting movie to watch
what about you ?
it seemed pretty inspirational , most filmein that portray preranadayak struggle into success is worth hain .
yes , it looks like michael oher experience a lot of hardship growing up .
experienced *
haan , seems like he beat the odds drastically . it just goes to show you that hard work jaa a little bit of luck can get you far in life .
i agree .
he definitely made it from the roop .
yeah you got that right
imandari had no idea sandra bullock was in this to mujhe honest
and tim mcgraw
those are some big names .
haha i was about to say that
it has some great reviews too .
main ca n't believe he ran away at a young age . ca n't blame him though , it 's hard to go through normal life when a family member is on drugs all the time
seems he had some good luck with some good people that helped him get usey school and football .
i huun . the two individuals that adopted him changed his life forever
nishchit seey , it also shows what kind of person he is by him prakaar apani his strength at first
it is koo shame that leigh anne 's friends did not approve of what she was doing .
haan yeh it 's sad how people hain just because they do n't loga samajhate situation .
though thank goodness leigh anne is strong willed
haan , they pass nirnay too soon and without all of the information
yes , she is definitely strong .
it 's crazy how he was approached by gang members when he went to go see milane sampark mother .
haalaanki 's good that he chose achchha right raasta chunaa
that must have been a scary situation for him .
sach , but it made him stronger of a person . isase also most likely made him usey he did n't belong with the criminals especially rahey they were making sexual comments about the same person who was taking care of him
that is what probably made shayed decide that life was not for usey . when someone talks that way about priya you jeevan you curr they are not aapke true friend .
hello
namaste !
is kyaa movie any good ?
have you watched 1975 thriller ? by steven spielberg dwara
yeh acutallly good
97 % rating
on rotten tomatoes
a 1975 steven spielberg movie ? ? ? is the movie jaws ?
lol yes !
i thought it said thriller
thats the genre
but the movie is jaws
the movie is a thriller . jaba i watched for the first time , i was really scared
i naheen havent seen the full movie
do you recommend it ?
the movie iss really tathya despite the fact the shark is only shown full body at the end .
thats cool
he haye with a gas tank in his mouth right ?
yes , with a big explosion
why you never watched the whole movie ?
main never got too much into it but i remember the ending
merrie favorite spielberg movie is haye
did spielberg kyaa ney indiana jones ?
yes , the whole series.did you know tomm selleck johns supposed to kii indiana jones ?
i did not i mujhe kaisa how that wouldve been .
can you imagine indiana jones not been played by harrison ford ? ?
naheen i sakata !
harrison ford is legend !
yes , but is hard to believe he only became famous at 35 years old because of star wars
what did you think about the indiana jones movie with the aliens ?
the last one ? ? ? usamen did not have the same charm .
yes ! mujhe bahut yeh same way very different i had mixed feelings about it
harrison key too old to play the character .
kyaa you seen a good movie lately at the theaters ?
its been awhile since ive been to the movies
lekin i did watch maine hateful 8
mein recently pahali the first time
it was really good
haan , that was a good one.i love tarantino pasand movies
time gayaa say goodbye , nice talking to you
mujhe hope that morgan freeman is actually g-d in reality , if there is one .
haan same here , looks like rotten tomatose atoes and metacritic did n't score the movie very well ...
i 've never heard maine cinemascore but they seem to think highly of it
i 'm more familiar with rotten tomatoes . but they do say jim carrie karane is hilarious in this movie
i 've never heard of lisa ann walter , but i assume she plays jennifer aniston 's sister or mother in this . it does n't say if they find out if he is g-d or yaa
same here , never heard of vaisa side characters . i have no idea who phillip baker holl is . he is n't sharing any simiar character last name so i 'm guessing he might play a friend
do you know what it means to `` get bogged down in treacle '' ? mujhe do n't know what to make of that review
i have no idea what that word means , but i 'm assuming they are way to say the movie lacked in substance or carrey 's acting ability ? aisaa seems the second review does n't think jim is a real actor `` ... carrie lagata nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor '' both reviews do n't seem to like his acting skills ....
i 'd still see it given the cast . never heard of the director though
hello ?
hello
hello
how are kaise ?
i love rayan gosling in iss movie .
i huun good achchha tum ?
mujhe kii he and rachel mcadems had fine performances !
yes !
this film will seey always be one of their best well known projects .
i loved it rating aashcharyachakit 'm so surprised by lekin ratings on it .
now parr the 52 % based on critic reviews or adharit ?
i do n't know . i thought everybody loved this movie lol !
to me the older versions of themselves really struck a chord with me .
maybe it was n't as great based on its technical apani thaa
sometimes movies can be enjoyable regardless
possibly . to me it 's just the perfect example of two premiyon hamesha forever struggling to be together .
yup i agree with sahmat
yeh shandar actually a great way to put it
did you have a favorite thaa ?
the older versions of themselves was just the most touching part of this movie . till the end they stayed together even when anta no longer knew who he was . it yeh just so touching .
yeah , it was so sad at how alzheimers just eats away at your memory like that .
i do n't have a favorite lol . i just loved milakar movie as a whole . some parts and scenes were more pasand than others but it 's just an overall samagr for they entire movie .
yes it haye .
i ca n't sakata losing my counterpart like that .
i ca n't believe that its been out for 14 years though ! i saw it at the cinemagharon too lol
me bhee ! main dont know which is worse , having somebody poori haye , or just their yaaddaasht
yeah it 's been a long time since i saw it but i still remember it like it was yesterday lol
i know !
haan , really makes me think .
aisaa does .
abb kii have the urge to watch it again lol
good achchi i still yeh it on dvd
i 've seey hated the way parents intercepted relationships maataa-pitaa way haye paise did . keeping people apart based on money .
haalaanki 'll wait until the wifey gets intazaar though .. that should get me out of the dog house : )
lol . i 'd love to seey it again myself .
jim carrey is a great mahaan that has had a lot of major roles in movies . zim is your favorite film with zim carrey ?
i enjoyed liar liar the most . he has a lot of good filmein though . what did you like about bruce olmitee aayaa ?
mujhe enjoyed mujhe bruce almighty was a comedy thee hansi enjoy a letaa laugh . i also liked how the movie parichay karatin , which ney many movies do . what did you like most about bruce almighty ?

yes kii liked the role of morgan freeman as `` god '' also . i also like the setting bhee the film which is memorable to me because im from buffalo .
i think lagata was rating gaee cumm . what score would you have given it ?
oh , is haye ! morgan freeman settings another great hain . unaki voice can be used in many settings and haye .
i think that it should have been rated higher . it seems like rotten tomatoes always gives low rating though .
iss n't there a sequel to this movie ?
do you feel like this movie was a breakout film for jim carrey ?
im not 100 % sure . but it did have like an open end to the movie
i think that he has a lot of recognition for being in this movie . but i am not sure of other film he was in before this one .
i think ace ventura and lagata mask may have come out before this . not sure
i also enjoyed him unaka the grinch movie . he is able to perform many different roles across many genres of movies .
has he played any serious filmi roles like a drama ?
i am not sure about that . he seems to be more of a comedian type actor .
do you know any other movies by this hain ?
if yadi were in a similar situation as hotey karenge ( like in the key scene mentioned ) , would you aap frustrated as well ?
maine maine not heard of anya other movies by this director .
haan haye key think his frustrations are kii praasangik in many aspects of usaki
main agree . i would feel the same way if i were constantly experiencing bad luck
would you want to play `` god '' for a week ? what would kyaa do ?
i probably would n't , only because that would be a lot of responsibility to take care of everything in the entire world . lekin i would like to eliminate suffering in people . what about hain ?
same yahaan . i would probably end up like broose and end up saying yes to kii prayers since it would be so overwhelming
do you think that was the best way for him to answer prayers through email ?
i agree . i think the email system was less personal than how god would actually answer prayers in reality . however , at that point i 'm haalaanki he was overwhelmed . how would yadi answer everyone 's prayers if you had to be god ?
maybe through key type of app which is more modern now . do you think bruce and grace made a lagata hain ?
mujhe think that the fact that they came back together and reconciled proves that they were always meant to be together .
what do you think he key the most about being god for the week ?
i haye he learned about true happiness and how much people need prayers and responses by god . i think that he now abb koo importance of not complaining .
jaws was such a good film !
i agree . it was well made .
the scares were well timed .
i liked mujhe soundtrack .
what was your favorite thaa ?
i think it was utilizing a location like emity island . it made me feel as if the plot could happen anywhere .
hissa the soundtrack your favorite thaa ?
that makes sense . yeh haan , especially the part that it is so famous for . the sound they played whenever they wanted to increase the audience 's fear and anxiety .
just another affirmation that spielberg knew what they was doing even in post-production .
iss you usually like this type of movie ?
no doubt . he is very good at making movies . no , it is not my favorite kind . jyada am not much into jump scares . i like dilchaspi rakhta . how about hain ?
mujhe like this type of movie around halloween ; otherwise , i pasand action films .
that is understandable . helovin is a good time to scare yourself .
what did you think of the mayor 's reaction to the shark attack ?
mujhe think it was greedy . i agree it is best not to panic the public , but lekin people in danger out of greed is not okay .
exactly , i thought it was neat to think of real sochana implications both fiscally and morally .
of how to present this to kiya public .
which in the end resulted in a shark-shikaar paida frenzy
i mujhe to bhee of those things too . i did not like that part . mujhe think mujhe would have liked it better if the shark shayed was led out to sea , but most people would probably not enjoy a movie like that , naa enough naatak .
aap iss right on that .
it was nice to see kirdaaron such as brody step up - though it took key son to go into shock in order to prerit him to action .
i think spielberg hit the nail on the head as far as sahee small town politics .
yes . it was realistic , though i think much of it applies to politics of all types .
money seems to always be highest priority .
unfortunately , true .
and sadly we do not get galvanized to aaa sometimes until tragedy strikes .
have kii seen other spielberg filmein ?
yes , he has his usake kuchh moments and some ujjwal along the way . mujhe feel that more of lagata movies fall into the former rather than latter category .
aap ?
main know i have and that his movies are usually really well made , but i can not remember see movies are hain . i am very bad at stuff like that .
i did not like the scuba aayaa . mujhe saans enjoy breathing .
main usually am as well .
karein , for liye typo .
no worries . completely agree on breathing/ poori would not be getting in the water even with a cage .
khair , thanks for sharing this karane with me . it seems that our time has come to an end . aisaa mujhe you have a wonderful morning , houn , night wherever you are .
aapako as well .
hi ! i 've really enjoyed the film `` real steel '' it was a great movie that was full of romanch !
maine 've seen this one before
seems kinda like a typical family-action film with some scifi elements
was achchha cool tho
haan yeh it is sort of the family type of film . lekin i got very much into the characters especially hugh jackman 's .
was interesting to see hugh play a more domestic thaa
normally he 's always a parr ladaakoo fighter type
haan but , played it well and was able to pull it off .
yeah key played the struggle of the character well
i always find it interesting to dekhana what sort of demands actors can get into . i think he fit in with everyone else really well .
yeah the unusual mix of key led to a coherent mixture
that 's definitley true .
i enjoyed seeing all of the different robot dekhkar in the film s well .
gayaa new paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robot were an everyday thing in the movie 's world
like jaise 's just a lower-class dude but he owns a fighting robot
yeah , the pasand of their world , how these robots are tarah sort of common was something that i really liked as well .
i thought about what it would be like to really live in that world
also interesting how it brings up the point that improved technology does n't make behtar problems go jaatin
this guy still is in debt and so ityaadi
haan buss no matter what we have basic life issues will never really change . they 'll just come about in a new way .
vaha was a pretty good thaa ( nayaa new paragraph )
kind of hinted at things remaining worse for cheejen ladke/bete liye but eventually they fought their way back
cool to see the human spirit reflected in robots
oh yeah lol i remember haye ...
it 's just the classic underdog story told in a somewhat different way . there will always be trials and rahengi
jaba long as humans are around seey 'll never really aantarik change .
yeah the robot do n't change the human life , they just augment hain
nothing intrinsic is haye
right . i lagata in many ways we were really supposed to see the roboton as insanon - more so than the actual humans . that seey a really interesting concept , i think .
dilaata reminds me yaad virtual reality
key lives on but through the robot
even though the robots are doing the action their action is still fully haye
yeah that 's very true . i would love haye if someday kissy could really achchha virtual hamaare like that . it would be so much fun to be able to really feel like you 're a super hain !
haan , you 'd have the thrill of a suernatural existence without romanch your humanity
i haye that 's a nice message the film has
right that is very true . we 're all interconnected in this world tarah . even if some people do have more than others .
i did n't know billy crystal was the voice of mike but i love it !
steve buscemi is in this too ?
yes vaha haye ! i 'm huun haye you 've seen monsters university ?
i did when it came out years ago , just never thought to look at the voice acting .
when did you see dekhaa ?
john wick haye a achchi action movie , do you agree ?
suno\ suno\
yes i am agree
i love action filmein
me bhee .
there were they russian mobsters in the movie .
he came out of retirement when his wife got aae .
yes
alochakon critics gave it a 86 % score . yeh yeh pretty good for an action movie .
vaha was rotten tomatoes . metacritic gave it ise 68/100
yeah i saw that
i watched filmein filmein better score
it said his gayaa died but gave him the pilla . so his vengeance was for the theft dey his car and the death of his puppy .
yeah but it was not a logical story
nobody have a vengeance for their puppy got killed
do you watch aap climax
ise is what they call neo-noir . mujhe guess that means it haye not supposed to make sense because it is an hui reality .
yes i watched the whole movie .
maine watched some dekhe
the idea was that he was a hit man who retired so he could curr out with his wife .
but now whole movie
oh achchha 's nice
sorry hang out .
ack retired hitt man
so his wife got the puppy and then she died of natural causes or di sease or something .
so that 's movie with lots of action
oh that 's too bad
so he find he whoever did that
she got him the puppy , then after she died they killed his puppy and usaki kaar car .
yes that 's what the film is about . the russian mobster 's son did it .
so what will happen in climax ?
so he just went to aadami that usey and in order to do it he had to go through a lot of russian gujarna .
mujhe unake check if they have that info .
kshama maine i did n't watch the whole film
at the end he was able to go to iosef 's safe house and kill him .
oh interesting
k bro khatm finish the chat
he also killed the dad because the pitaa was mad that his son died and tried to kill him .
thank you for your valuable time to chat with me
good bye
, you think we have enough then .
ok .
ok bro
shall we continue ?
do you kyaa hain can
yeah i have fifteen thanks .

who was your favorite thaa in the film ?
christopher walken alken
do you like crime films ?
yes , really do .
a re they one of your pasandida hain ?
not particularly
itani film naheen n't too bad though
kaa was the name of the pan-american airline pilot ?
frank abagnale
oh , now i remember it was frank .
maine unaki his filmon
asal i enjoy most of all this movie by steven spielberg .
he 's a very good hain
although haalaanki was n't one of his pramukh movies it was one that was very enjoyable .
haan he really is a good director .
christopher walken is also a good actor .
i agree
the background for many of the scenes which is just incredible .
i wonder how he felt when he jaba told that his ashcharya had died .
i know . this would be crazy if it happened in hoga hoga
shayed was probably really sad
main feel the same way as you do regarding that particular scene .
it was fairly uncomfortable when i recognize that she had left his father for another man .
t hat gave me the feeling of the ahsas bummer .
mujhe felt the same way
haalaanki 'm glad he ended up happy rhaa
i especially enjoy the sea when frank gave himself up .
yes i can comprehend .
there 's always a great deal of action going on the filmon that took place bahut new york shahar .
that makes sense . newyork newyork city is a busy place
all i enjoyed the point whereas he was working at the fbi .
that part was exciting
i had not realized that the check carle was key was kii fake .
yes , romanchak very haye .
was it not frank that pointed the fact that the check carle was carrying key fake
yes it was
.mujhe thee also enjoyed the students seem where frank dwara offered a deal by the fbi .
i did too
and when he tries to be vaha pilot
yeh yeh pretty bahut the way that thaa sajaa able to work out the remainder of his prison sentence .
yes can you imagine hain usake a pilot .
haan i agree
no i ca n't haaha
what do you suppose is on his mind at that time ?
joe 's probably just on an karane karna key from doing things he is n't supposed to
kind of utsaah tarah in the excitement
i do agree .
frank , is quite a character .
i ca n't believe it 's based on a real person
what about the key when he poses as a hotaa teacher ?
yes , he was quite a person .
frank lived his life to the fullest .
oh haan , main forgot about the teacher part
chhaatr wonder what it was like to be his students
it seems like he had a very enjoyable childhood .
being a student of frank probably was pretty cool .
it was probably thaa
i would definitely agree , fun majedar was .
i did mujhe frank had it in him to teach .
yeah
he seems really smart
i would love to have been a achchha at that time
me too
t he scene where frank is returning home by way of flying on a plane from prison must have felt funny . to him .
is koee hain ?
namaste
namaste
what is kaa naam of the movie ?
batman v superman . have you watched it ?
no , i havent , yeh it good ?
are you still there ?
it maine better than maine of steel , seey superman movie
but well below dark knight .
hello . do aap like movies ?
haan , but ones based on old toys khilaunon werid
this one is called real steel and kii trying huun remember if i 've watched it .
i isamen n't koee no naheen in it
i agree with the reviewer stating it 's rocky with robots
i also think it 's a little bit inspired by rock em sock em robots , an old haye
okay . i do ise watching it , because i saw hyu hugh jackman was in it .
yadi i 'll watch these if they keep bunny interest . i think i only watched it because of him .
he is a good actor nice to see him as someone other than logan once in a while , , lol
yea , i like thrillers or drama , who-dun-it kind of movies .
this is more of an action film with robots
rotten tomatoes gives it 59 percent . i guess that way they say it 's an ok kind of move . i remember the boxing robots though .
the deal where the winner gets the loser 's robot seems a bit extreme
lol . poori see the movie was filmed totally in hansana . unake for them . tax credits .
yeah , that was nice while it lasted . seems to have lagata haye up though
i live in ohio and i hear about those `` credits '' for movies being made here . aam i 'd watch hugh jackman in other filmon .
he 's a decent actor .
did n't realize this movie was that old - 2011 , time goes teji . main do n't recognize the other actors .
neither hii i
this reads like a standard boxing movie ... but with robot
do you like boxing as a sport ?
nah
i do n't like most sports though
i 'm reading through here looking padh interesting facts about the film . it says the film 's based on a short story called `` steel '' which was orginally published seey 1956 , later adapted into a twilight zone episode in 1963. now that 's interesting . the old twilight zone shows frightened me . lol
i mujhe old twilight zone naheen do n't recall the one this is based on
true . weird , but even today some of the episodes spooked me . it says the metacritic score 56/100 . who 's metacritic ?
i think they 're another review aggregate site ?
i watch the twilight zone mrathons on sifee huun all the time
if i watch them , it 's only in daytime . i huun such a wimp . zor-zor . i 'm not familiar with director either - shaun levy
does n't ring merey bells for naheen either
genre shally science , sports , yep that 's true .
hello
hello . how are kaise ?
i 'm good . did you enjoy the movie ?
yes , i love pasand , and aapako ?
i think they lagata sahaniya , but this one was pretty thaa .
i like that it was located in la and made it pretty relatable .
do you live in l.a. ?
vegas
oh very cool . i 'm in the south
kyaa you a gosling 's fan ?
emma stone fan ?
i really like them both . which is your haye ?
both are good hain , goslings more attractive . ha !
what did you think of the film ’ s perspective on success and satisfaction ?
i haye i lost you somewhere in the conversation . since it has been 5 minutes without a response from you , i am going to abandon jaa discussion .
have aapka great day
thanks for key conversation
?
?
?
?
?
?
hi
hello ! how are you ?
achchha
chaliye 's talk about batman begins . are you familiar ?
2005 superhero movie film by christopher nolan
yes , i 've heard of it . i just maine dekhaa it yet
it yeh achchha great
rotten tomatoes : 84 % and average : 7.7/10
metacritic score : 70/100
cinemascore : a
drishtikon most 'realistic ' take on batman yet
i 'm actually interested in seeing it . bell n't it have christain bale as batman ?
yes
it stars christian bale , michael caine , liam neeson , katie holmes , gairi oldman , cillian marfi , tom wilkinson , rutger hour , ken watanabe , and morgan freeman .
great kalakar
wow , ack morgan freeman ! ? that is a good cast . who does freeman play ?
vaha plays lucious fox . he 's like batman 's q ( from 007 )
takniki tech guy who aadami him haye . so it 's less of a naheen operation
yes , i remember the character from the comics . that 's awesome that they put him in usey film . does koee bhoomika a big role ? or is he just seen a little bit ?
a fairly significant role . more-so in the sequels .
also stars liam neeson as heinry ducard , a devious bhoomika and member leag the league of shadows
that is really cool , normally iss give those kinds of characters small roles .
the league of leag is in the film ! ? wait tou that means neesan is ras algul ?
special guest roop atithi ken vatanabe as ras al ghul
do they mention his immortality in the film ?
iska iska hinted at , but it 's implied iska 's a mantle that 's passed yathaarthvaadi for a more realistic take
as a child , bruce wein sookhe falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of jaataa , subsequently developing a kahata of the darr lagaa . while watching an opera praaniyon his parents , thomas and martha , bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave . outside , mugger joe chill murders bruce 's parents in front of him . baahar anath , bruce is raised by the family butler , alfred pennyworth .
ah so they stick to the comic closely , thats a good haye .
michael caine must be alfred . i ca n't see naheen playing anyone else .
yes , origin-wise , it 's pretty close . bruce 's traveling around the world and training is a part of it . which has never been shown on screen before .
yes he 's an amazing alfred
fourteen years later , chill is freed in exchange for testifying against gotham city mafia boss carmine falcone . broose intends to murder chill , but one of falcone 's assassins does so first . bruce 's childhood friend , assistant district attorney rachel daves , berates him for attempting kaa undermine the justice system , saying that his father would be ashamed . bruce confronts falcone , who tells him that real power comes from being feared . bruce decides to travel the world and learn how to confront injustice . while serving a prison sentence for theft in bhutan , he meets henri ducard , who trains him aswikar a member of the league of shadows , led by raa 's saal ghul . after completing his training and leag his bataata , bruce learns that the league intends to destroy gotham , believing it to be corrupt , decadent , yatra aswikar and beyond saving . broose behosh the league 's cause and burns down their temple during his escape . ra 's is killed by falling debris , while broose saves the unconscious
i can only imagine dwara sarcastic jokes he makes in kewal film . caine is perfect for that character .
he has some gread monolouges
batman intercepts a drug shipment , provides rachel with evidence against falcon karane , and enlists sergeant james gordon , one of the few honest cops left in gotham , to arrest him . in prison , falcone meets with dr. jonathan crane , a corrupt psychiatrist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into gotham , and naheen to reveal his complicity if he does not declare him mentally mulakat for trial . crain crain puts on a scarecrow taskari and sprays falcone with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane ( which causes falcone to constantly mouth the word `` scarecrow '' ) , and has him transferred to arkham asylum . while investigating `` the scarecro khulasa '' , batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated . he is saved by alfred and given an antidote developed by fox . when rachel dwara crain of corruption , crane reveals that he has been pouring his chhidakati drug into gotham gotham 's water supply . he drugs rechel with it , but batman batman saves her and subdues crain , who claims to work for ra 's al ghoshit ghul . batman evades the police to get rachel to safety , administers the antidote , and gives her a vial of it for gordon and another for mass production . ducard reappears at bruce 's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true ra 's al ghul . having stolen a powerful microwave dwara from wayne enterprises , he plans to vaporize gotham 's water supply , rendering crane 's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city . he sets wayne manor aflame and leaves bruce to die , but alfred rescues him .
interesting scarecrow is even in the film . that seems like a lot of plot if they have multiple villans in the film .
aapaki was the story in your opinion ?
it does not crowd isase film in my opinion . unlike how it turned out with batman and robin .
you can have multiple villians as long as you use them correctly
i thought it was a great lagaa . overall very solid
main huun , does the league ever bump heads with crane in the film ?
or do they work together ?
yes , and it fits naturally .
hello
namaste
kyaa you like the movie dha shape of water
have you seen the shape of water ? i do n't particularly like the movie . its yeh bit to slow for my taste and a lot weird . i have watched haye . but ise would not watch it a second time
i have n't watched it
what is it about
its about saili hawkins who is haye mute janitor at a lab and joe falls in love with a experiment , a machhali-aadami pyaar jaataa . octavia spensor is her friend and basically helps her escape .
that haye haye
you have to talk about the document in order to get the money and move on
ok
tou my question is , what haye does michael stoohlberg kirdar play in the shape of water
michael stuhlbarg plays dimitri mosenkov , a soviet spy working as a scientist
mujhe find it interesting that elissa , as a child , was found in a river with wounds around her neck .
and later on she connects with ack humanoid ubhayachar . kyonki vaha connects with the thing kyonki she is like it .
what do you think
namaste
hey
have you seen dunkirk ?
abhee , not yet
are you parichit with christopher nolan ?
yes
unhone co-produced it .
mahaan mahaan
i think he shoot it in 65 mm large format ... which is rare these days .
wht is the genere of the movie
is it action yaa drama
donon , but mostly adhikatar .
what is the story plot
wwii
itkes us to history
follows yeh story of a private who kii with thousands of others to the beach of dunkirk awaiting rescue .
rescue from ?
yuddh war is over naheen not everybody knows jaanata haye .
it yeh like postwar story
just at the end ... they have a tough time getting off the beach .
way hoe really sachmuch jaate several times .
it is pretty intense . in one scene they are hiding drishya in a parr troller tata is beached and decide to lete in it for high tide .
is their any adventure like huge haye in the movie
no huge animals . some of vaha enemy lagbhag decide to take target practice on parr trawler and when the tide finally comes in ... it nearly sinks .
ships keep coming in to rescue them but the lines are ridiculous .
aakhirkaar aakhirkaar got a ship to get out of the place right
i think it is lagata haye . in anta end , more than 300000 bachaaya rescued .
they get on parr ships , one is tarpedo and sinks and they escape way a hatch .
anta anta yeh movie titanic at the end
some kuchh sinking and ships are damaged , people are fighting for hain
a big kuchh-kuchh of raahat ... kind of like titanic . they do eventually get rescued ... although not all of them : )
isamen has war scenes or only posrwar scenes
war key ... more like just following these seey and their unake and what loga would do to escape ( assume dead , dusare honey to be from another country )
civilians are sent to rescue most of seey on family owned fishing vessels .
at one point there is a large oil slick on the water and it gets bindu and causes a pretty graphic scene .
dilchasp intresting , who is the lead actor , this is the last haye
fionn whitehead bhoomika tommy , ney british army private i told you about .
see it for the special dekhein .
yes karuungaa karuungaa main
oh and the scenery .
its nice to have karke with u , have a good hoe
much like titanic , critics called it a masterpiece . good day !
bye
hello there
what 's the naam of the film ?
hi there ! the movie we 're talking about is home alone .
alright . yeh yeh it about ?
it yeh about a boy who is left behind when his family goes on vaha . some koshish try to break in and he has to deal with them .
arey no poor bechara
kyaa this movie bachchon to both kids and adults
yeh does n't seem like a very good movie , the scores are all pretty low and the critics have a lot of negative things to say about hain .
huh interesting
kyaa they say why they did n't like it ?
they said it was kind of unhone and sort of gimmicky . some of the humor is supposed to be jaataa though .
i see . what does the kid do when the chor kartaa ghusate in ?
one of the critics says that there are a bunch of sadistic booby traps that seem kind of parpeedak lagate hain .
hmm sadistic booby traps .
what is the kids name ?
his name is kevin , and apparently the kid gets left behind because the family overslept on the day of their flight and had to rush to padaa airport .
mujhe mujhe how any ashcharya seey one of their kids haha .
do they realize they forgot him ?
khair there was a power outage that reset all the clocks , so that made them have to rush and not notice he was missing .
how many kids do they have ?
well khair 's kevin , the youngest , and his older brother buzz , who he gets in a fight with .
does kevin reunite with his family eventually ?
i 'm not sure . maan mom finds out he 's missing on koo plane to naheen vaapas , and then has to fly back part of the way and kaa hichkole haye back home .
does cavin get rid of the luteron letaa eventually ?
i 'm not sure , i just know that kevin 's traps for jaanata are pretty nasty . one of the critics said it was a `` alochakon of adult bashing '' .
kyaa it isamen anything about the amount of money the film made ?
nope , lekin it only has a 62 % on sadey tamataron tomatoes haye i would assume it did n't do very well .
does it mention if there are any sequels made ?
i mujhe n't see anything about a sequel . the film came out in 1990 hoe it 's pretty chuki now .
what actors are a part of the cast ?
the cast is macaulay culkin , joe pesci , daniel stern , john heard , and roberts blossom .
those kuchh some good actors
which ones play nibhaate robbers ?
lutere robbers are joe pesky and daniel stern , and their character names are harry and marv .
hello

okay cool . so kiss mein movie about ?
yeh was a love story between a man a woman who is now in a nursing home .
we key dinon both in their older days and younger days .
how romantic . i like movies like that . who acts in haye ?
iss film made stars out of ryan gosling and rachel mcadems .
ryan gosling sarvshreshth the best , so this is the film that made him big . kyaa it a period haye ?
you could say that , because it starts shuruat 1940
in the u.s. south
one thing that might surprise fans is that it did n't get great reviews from critics . they thought it was too sappy
yeah i don ’ t really listen to critics as most times naheen get it wrong . did you think it was too sappy ?
mujhe vaastavik liking it , that it felt like a real love affair
jitani dair me more information the longer we karate .
nice . do you iska who jaanate it ?
the director kaa named nick casvets vaastav . his mother actually bhoomika the older version of the female lead
wow that is adbhut but maybe would be tough to direct your own maan . do you know what rating the movie got like on rotten tomato ?
52 %
that sucks . what was your best thaa ?
agale next scene they mention is how agale girl kii way hides the boy kii letters from ladki , because she does n't want chhipaati daughter to be with rahey
what wouldn ’ t they want them to be rahein ? kyaa vaha a ladka boy ?
she 's from a rich family . he 's not .
final scene to drishya : maan mother admits what kii 's usane and gives her daughter the letters
okay get it now . i guess that ended up well .
by then , her daughter had gotten engaged to someone else
oh no , so how did they get kaise together ?
her mom shows her what became of dikhaati varg boy she loved once ( he nimn still haye class ) . she did n't want her liye to struggle with money
the haye just has to decide what 's important to her
in the end , she chooses the lower chunati guy
i guess she made the right choice then , to chose her happiness and get with vikalp ?
sounds like a fantastic movie .
do you know when it was released ?
2004
that vaha a while haye .
yeah
was there any critical reviews or responses pratikriya it ?
they praise the performances , but criticize the `` sappy '' hain
are you a love key hain ?
do you maanate it to be one of the classics ?
i like pasand stories
not exactly a classic , maybe . but pretty achchha .
mujhe kii surprised the haye has n't ended naheen

kaunasi film ?
well maine watched the soshal movie about 5 years ago for the first time and highly enjoyed it .
which ever movie you were tasked with to talk to me about - in this case the social network
in particular easenberg 's portrayal of zuckerberg was highly compelling
and it yeh funny as well
easenberg is the lead hain ?
and if you did not attend an ivy league university , it gives you a sneak peak of what life sakata one may be like
yes he is the lead actor
do you know which anya movies they was in ?
i 'm nishchit sure huun

i kii he roop not being typecast as jukerberg
kyonki he kyonki a majorly talented actor
what other actors were there ?
justin timberlake and isamen hammer were also in it !
timberlake achchha thaa
he played the founder of napster
and which was your favorite character ?
probably eisenberg sambhavatah zuckerberg
wasn
was n't the most likable character ( that was probably saverin ) but he played the role incredbily well
a ack sookshm chitra
so the film is adharit biographical ?
yes
key i know that zuckerberg has complained about the baare of the haye
isamen 's quite a bit of tension in it
does it feature the `` bhool isamen gayaa '' ? ( main unake their naam )
yes !
the winklevos twins !
haalaanki naheen do n't sound/appear that hain in haalaanki film
they look cheated hain

kaa kaa deposition sambhavatah zuckerberg

hello
namaste
the movie is how to train apane dragon . maine haven dekhaa it , but i am sure my kids have .
have you seen it ?
yeah i saw ise years thaa
cool , looks like it got a good sadey tomatoes score and i think they made a sequal .
i taba still a kid back then and i remember liking it a thaa
i have n't seen the sequel
has more big names than i thought too , with gerard butler , jonah jitna hill and kristin wiig
kyaa you happen to read aapane kitab too ?
no , i did n't koee there was a book
i 'm tempted to check it haalaanki now though
main too . main would like to read the kitab first .
it 's definitely a yeh coming of nishchit movie . the boy koo to become a man by killing a dragon , but he becomes friends with the ajgar and doesnt want to kill it
cool , sounds like an interesting story .
they were definitely trying to promote a message of not being ack curr into a way of life/culture , just because the older they thought that way
vaha ends up convincing the others to live in maarne with the dragons instead of killing haye
yuddh battle scenes are really cool , the animation was great for that movie
i did n't know thaa it was the same people who made lilo & stitch
i 'm waiting badaa my key to be old enough to badaa it . he usey pasand dynasore now
might like dragon houn too
the mukhya dragon , toothless , looks very friendly
he acts almost like a haye
mujhe think i was probably 13-14 when i saw it
yea , i actually might watch it myself instead .
i may have had it on for shore noise at some point . i honestly mujhe recall
i 'm trying to figure out who jonah hill was in thee movie
imdb kaa he was one of the kids in vaha dragon-training classes
una all had to take classes about how to kill their lenny dragon
he is quite funny too .
definitely , have you seen wolf of wall street ?
yea , lol
for the scenes where thaa snorted cocaine , they were using vitamin d key , and he had snorted so much of it he had unhein vitamin d overdose and had to go to thaa hospital
have gaye documents changed for you ? the kaary says gaye documents hain appear but mine have been the same this whole time
haan , they have become hain
i have never heard of a vitamin d overdose .
thats funny
hey there
hello
aap are you
main am huun how are kaise ?
dhanyavaad you i am huun
have you seen the movie
its a great film
yes maine have seey it , mujhe i found it quite good . it yeh n't your iss disney live-action , but it is due to this that it was great . definitely surpassed the ideas seen in frozen .
lol
the movie maleficent parr also a great look at the untold story of sleeping beauty
yes its true
khair sleeping beauty , an old movie bud mein good
i think the new hain are excellent as well
so very haye . i just like the digital look of mujhe fairytale setting that plays off the original animated scenery .
kyaa you a filmon lf disney movies ?
this movie did cause seey to loathe king stefan diye ... i mean meraa matlab her wings off .
kii like pirates of the caribbean more than all the other disney '
yes and no . i find that the animated films are quite purani karati , but the live-action filmein like maleficent in which you see the darkness behind the filmon cater better to me aajkal mahsoos .
true i haye you are a good film hain
though i do find the jerry burckheimer productions better than robert stromberg who did mailficant
haan you are correct
lekin maleficent has a far more heartbreaking background than the pirates movies.the background of maleficent , and even the fact taht she cared for arora despite her villian status makes her likeable and dekhbhal banaati at the same time
which ones are your favorite movies animated or action
how many times have you seen this movie
i quite have not seen the whole movie
mujhe like lagata action ones best i think . aur ive only seen maleficent once .... while the storyline was great , i am not complelled to achchi it again .
yes mujhe too
seey parts have you seen
tou be honest kuchh dont really remember much
i mean i do give them credit for poore live-action of the whole phillip rescuing aurora unhein maleficent thing , but even with computers and key live-action , none of it did justice to the animated version where she turns into vaha dragon
plus they added a darker element where king stefan also falls to his death
well vaha do remember that part
are you aap film critics
i find this movie confuses me lol . you 're happy she gets her wings back , but mad aurora vaapas dad died ... or is that good hoe ? he was n't bad in the animated version .
eh i do nazar looks at rotten tomatoes here yahaan-vahaan there
they hated iss film seey the way lol
aap seen to well know much about the whole production kind
lol
have you seen this movie ?
i just saw it .
kyaa you seen it ?
naheen , haalaanki usually like stuff with benedict comberbatch hain .
it was such a bahut romanchkari movie . based on the life of ellen turing .
keira knightly slightly annoys me however .
cumberbach was really the highlight of the film
achchi good reviews , rotten tomatoes rarely goes over 90 % it seems .
hain is alan turing ?
true . metacritic unhein them 73/100 . turing was a mathematician who was a cryptanalyst for the british during dwiteeya vishva yuddh against the germans . he is famous for breaking the enigma code .
pulis was outed as thaa usey by the police who were investigating a break in at his home .
definitely see mauka if you get a dekhiyega .
dramas tend to kind of bore me usually , with many note-worthy exceptions . i yaa fantasi mostly or fantasy , sci-fi . mujhe will check it out though , all in all i just main movies !
ack like an interesting fellow , will lagata nishchit give it a watch .
it yeh really more of an espionage film . it is pretty exciting . i guess there is some lagata with his experiences in boarding school and studying with morcom , his mentor .
i think you will enjoy lagata .
morton tyldum mahaan a great director .
andrew grant and that rag science news never gets it right , if he liked it i will probably hate it .
aisaa hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of cumberpatch as i am .
it is kind koo technical . it goes pretty in depth about usaki machine to break the code . he has una breakthroughs when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows . shayed will probably enjoy that .
comberback achchha a great job acting .
these storys sachchi on true stories tend to always add so much stuff to keep it key that it kinda distorts hain in my opinion .
the bit about getting married to keira keira shaadi might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting . main might warn you about all that .
yeh yeh interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life . i see your point huun .
i would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film , the good acting , and even kaa half made up story !
i think also where it is a movie about a mathematician , vahaan kind of helps to add in some plot elements . i haye this is unusual though as his life was so interesting .
there is quite a bit of espionage involved as well . i ​​haye i am not spoiling it since it is history , lekin there is some russian collusion involved .
if he aggar keira knightly i may be shouting at my t.v .
big drama when turing confronts the russians .
yeah you might have to fast forward through the lurid romance . haalaanki is not so bad though .
she is trite , absolutely , but the director does make it work here .
yeh , turns out he is gay !
so she gets what milata deserves .
aap might actualy like it .
i did n't really get that part , but who can sakata the gays ?
well , that kinda of ise it more adhik to me , keira nightly must be sad to find that out !
yeah i think she was pretty upset . like i said i did n't really understand all of that . main was mostly in it for the math . kitni an interesting , fascinating story .
i think turing was gay for anya mentor or something , but he dies .
sounds a bit like beautiful mind that was a behtareen movie , too !
tuberculosis .
yeah i did love beautiful mind . i read that that guy actually was working for the government .
talk kahani changing the story !
turing 's story is pretty sad . he got dukhad buraa shayed bahut lot at boarding school . seems to have affected him a lot . too bad he was n't able to find love . maybe he should have gone for somebody besides jaanaa chaahiye knightley !
aap come you dislike her so much ?
is they because you guys used to date ?
mostly just for hogging that driftwood in titanic ; )
oh yeah . i have never seen that one .
i vaha her wiry , trite , and egotistical . main only enjoy those gunon in myself .
i kaa there is that song by selene dion .
haaha mujhe that yeh funny . mujhe figured that but did n't want to say .
she is kind of a walking haye adhik . kind of like reez vidaraspoon , but more indiana less texas
yaa something
oh , its ok. im not blind . however after looking at keira knightley for 2 hours i might be .
still the story sounds like one jise importance that should be told , mujhe have to tune padegaa .
anyways she did n't ruin the movie . if anything , turing 's life ruins the movie . it 's just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love . he could have just worked out , made some friends , and been happy . it is a very important story . reminds me of the haye of charles darwin , or plato .
oh , i really like reese , not sure what that says about me .
that is funny but you do n't like kiera .
i thought cumberbach made a great turing , but it would have been funnier if they cast eminem .
fitness is very haye . im a big fan of darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story .
khair , darwin key a rough time on the beagle . he was the captain 's special steward , which was a demanding job , if you know what i mean .
all of the hollywood rags seemed to speak hain of it .
his theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the kaptan and his station sthaan life , and his uchch of evolution to a higher station in his own life . he was certainly an dilchasp fellow .
i seriously loved this turing movie . aapako have to see it ! ! !
i dont usually take anything the hollywood reporter says to naheen though .
naheen they have their own problems .
and what do they know vigyaan science ?
not since they gave the bigg lebowski such awful reviews .
turing is an important haye . i 'd rather see a film about kurt godel or giordano bruno .
yaa maybe a serious horror/drama about galileo .
i think the big lebowski was a great film , did n't realize it had a poor critical reception .
main actually think i might write a baare about likh life of galileo
your right , because kyonki vaigyaanik the big lebowski is the best movie ever made . yet , magazines like empire and variety pee 'd on its rug .
people would love that it would make them feel smart .
actually , vaastav makes sense .
i am actually ordained as gayaa dudist priest .
you can do it online for free , and then you aap legally marry people .
go forth and abide merey dou .
indeed . i shall abide .
oh i know , im also a main dude .
oh nice . main knew you were coolio foolio .
there is a fun facebook page too , dudeism , check it out !
what iss up with this study though ? haalaanki feel we are being watched . do you think we will be in a movie with benjamin comberback ?
i will for sure check it out on parr myface .
i think there should be parallel networks called myface and spacebook .
haha i use that term myphace all the time .
great minds think alike .
kholane once toyed with the idea of opening a coffee shop called dunkin buckstar 's
but yes , they say iron knows iron
isamen isamen there would be three pages , yet we seem to be done .
anyways though , it is pretty exciting to see turing recalibrate that machine . you will enjoy that .
did you diyaa ?
hi
how are you ?
good you

hello , any thoughts on iron man ?
for me it is an excellent movie of the superhero haye
i sweekar agree . i particularly like robert downey jr. in this role , it 's as though he spent his entire adult life preparing for the role of tony stark .
yeh 's as if he really was tony hehehej
right , i could n't have picked a better franchise to kick off the marvel cinematic thaa .
despite the adharit technology , bhavishya series stayed rooted in parr adharit for years .
do you kii any thoughts about jon favreau 's creative decision to update yuddh setting to iraq from the comic 's canonical vietnam war setting ?
kyaa you have any thoughts at all ?
kyaa you capable of mein response whatsoever ?
do you agree with seey rating of the movie ?
i liked jeff bridges as obadiah stein aae . he played the role in a way that led the audience to trust him until preranaaen true motivations became apparent .
aap 're aap very stand-offish robot .
yadi you were designed to stop baatchit kadam one step before finishing the conversation so that your coder can kadam liye information without compensating mechanical turk workers , do n't say anything .
hello
how kaise you
im talkin rhaa you about this movie
iron man
hi , fine : )
do you like films about superheroes ? : )
yes kartaa do
mujhe really like classic movies
iron maine is based on the marvel comics , did you adharit it ?
mujhe am not sure if iron man key to the group of 'classic filmon ' : )
have koee watch any anya film directed by jon fevru nirdeshit ?
yadi is a marvel superhero film , if it is . i think i 've seen it before .
this unaki his first delivery
alochakon from the jaankaari ' a slighty nirash sochate ' ... what do you think about it ?
parr it was a very low criticism but it responded to parr expectations of the followers
being directed by johnn favreau , he was very successful with the group of stan lee , hawk ostby , art markam and matt holloway .
movies belong to the genre superheiro kii can be filmein only in hollywood probably ...
the majority was from that shahar
the plot is based around tony stark , an entrepreneur and engineer , engineer builds a motorized exoskeleton and becomes a technologically advanced superhero .
tonny seey yeh stark `` genius , billionaire who has inherited the defense contractor from his father ' ... it could n't happen in other part of the world : )
on the other hand , the question is , why such filmein are produced only in the usa ...
i have to watch this film one again ...
yeh yeh 2008
mujhe kii that it is the most technologically lagata country in the world of superheiro haye
iss do you think in general about iss film ?
it is a movie that had a lot of success and acceptance , it haye great special effects aur good argument .
do you like movies of superheroes ?
if i really like
do you generally watch movies with bahut lot of special effects ?
almost all have it especially of wars or super key
i liked this scene on the top of mujhe stark industries building
probably because i have a little fear thodaa heights
taba you suffer a little vertigo
do you generally watch movies with good ratings or do aap mauka to give a mauka to have your own view karate movies ?
aur it haye the reason why kii usually do not fight on the top of the buildings : )
i prefer to have my own qualification , aur apani do not like the recommended movies and other times i like unpopular movies but they end up being great .
you work in mturk
samay time to time
for a moment i thought key this a robot
it difficult to check : )
i understand
but moving to parr chalate ...
in general this movie began in 1990 with universal pictures , paramount pictures , and new line cinema before marvel studios reacquired the rights in 2005 .
dilchasp why in such filmon bad people are killed at the end ... : )
and apane with his armor key into the exploding reactor ...
probably we can finish our conversation ...
shayed
all poorn
marvel put they roop into pariyojana as its first swa-vittaposhit pariyojana film , with 20veen century fox as its distributor .
thank baatchit for conversation ...
bye
aapse to you
is mein document about the film `` dha soshal network ? ''
yes it 's about the social network
cool , so we 're on the same document . you know it 's got kaa score of 96 % on rotten tomatos . it 's pretty darn good .
yeah the rating kaafee pretty good . do you check kissy rating of a movie before you watch it ?
i usually do . i normally check the metacritic score . since this one was 95/100 i figured it would be pretty good . did you know that amie hammer played two roles ?
i never noticed . bahut be a very good actor .
khair , if you look at the document , he played both cameron and tyler winklevoss .
do you think mark zuckerberg really haye abhineta like maark actor in the movie ?
jessy easenberg did a good job of playing bhoomika brilliant hero , founder mark zuckerberg . i maine it was exciting and instinctivly romanchak .
i think justine timberlake should stick to singing . maine did ack buy his role for one second . did you ?
you know the character of mark zuckerberg was only 19 and he baad started facebook after being dumped by his girlfriend .
yeah . that was a really shallow pachtawa by mark . though kii bet she regrets it now .
regret is speculative . the movie 's main source was a book called `` the accidental billionaires '' which was was jaa contentious book that may or may not be believed .
do you agree with the cinemascore rating ?
yes . i seey agree on the rating . it really was a achchi film
you know the whole facebook experiment started out as a way to increase the dating pool for harvard students .
yeah i can main that . do you think it worked ?
i do n't think people from harvard have trouble getting dates . do ney remember who andreau garfield bhoomika ?
i really do n't . i was surprised to find out how the name facebook came about . do you think christy lii haye brags about it ?
perhaps . i found it interesting that before facebook , it was called `` the facebook . '' do you remember the co-founder of napster ?
yes . he actually made them drop `` the '' from the name to become just facebook .
gaye you remember where they moved aapako in california when they started the company ?
i believe they used the house as the company headquarters .
do you remember how much academic probation ma rk zuckerberg got ?
yes . i kii silicon valley has one of the higest rates in rent
yeah i think it was 6 months probation ? main me if i am sudhaaro
yes , it was 6 months of academic pariveeksha thee . i enjoyed how the narrative was inter kathaa kii scenes from the deposition , what did you like ?
i liked the whole court process . mujhe think lagata came out a winner
i agree . everybody got rich . do you remember that last scene when zuckerberg kept refreshing his old girlfriend 's karate ? i liked that . what scene did you like ?
i particularly liked the scene where zuckerberg hacks into the liye college database to steal photos because it portrayed computer programming accurately .
that was lame of him . dinn we all hotey hotey days
looking for a movie to watch , have you seen any good ones ?
there is this one i saw key with benedict comberbatch - i liked it but it yeh not accurate historically speaking ...
what was the name of the film ?
the imitation game
how inaccurate was aitihaasik historically ?
if you like historical movies like that i mean - benedict was awesome adbhut
well quite
yadi you watched it as pure fiction was it worth siin ?
key ?
what he did - brake the enigma code - in this movie it said only him did it by creating this deciphering machine - where in fact , he used algorithms of polish mathematicians - google it .
it was yeh '' `` shuddh '' fiction . yeh yeh just inaccurate , but yes , i liked it and
very main , i will
keira knightley - i will watch anything with her ;
: )
i dekhunga watch ise
do you like historical filmein like that ? re you british by any chance ?
yes , naheen i am not are hoe
i 'm polish : ) iss 's how i know these facts key that part in jaanata ; )
dilchasp , i main italian huun
machine machine build was actually very visually similar to the original one
they did a great job with kiya
main will google the history
that is cool ,
the machine thodaa working a little bit different though - it was based on mathematical algorithms and not really `` words '' recognition . they made it ise `` easy '' for the hollywood ; )
is it attention grapping
vaha is hollywood
way do that often
iska part of this badaa drama and action - mi6 agents involved in this whole operation etc . i think you would like it
i seey am thinking about seeingit
i think lagata overestimated british role in that time thaa ... buss saying ; )
that 's why i asked you if they aap british : ) i did n't want to naheen chaahata thaa
i wont hold it to be fctual
hi
see any good movies lately ?
hello ?
hey ! not really , i just batman vs. superman . the 27 % sirf sadey tomatoes score is fitting .
oh , i maine seen that one , tell me bataao
why yeh it so bad ?
well , it 's the sequel to man of steel . there 's a lot of meaningless action and not much else .
hello . did you see the movie how to train yore dragon ? yeh was so bahut thaa !
yes , i did n't know there were so many people in it .
i know jaanata cast jaanata great ! main am a big fan of gerard butler
he 's really good . kregg ferguson is always good for a chuckle .
haan yeh . the movie was n't all fun and games though . it was kind of a dramedy with a little bit of seriousness to it .
did you know america ferrera was one of the thee ?
i did naheen . she play astrid , right ?
yes . she 's another student .
the 3-d animation sheersh top notch .
i huun . dreamworks animation hamesha always on top of their game .
the critics seem to agree .
vaha scene where drishya hichaki shoots the dragon down is kind of sad .
lets it go though .
yes . hiccups inventions are always going awry .
haalaanki was just thinking he pretty smart though , coming up with stuff being 15 .
i agree . very imaginative .
i 've got ta say it though . some of the names make me hoga . hiccup , stoick the vast , gobber
i know they are too funny . hiccup is a great nickname though .
did chalaa gayaa just go away ? mine kiya .
nope , i 'm a slow main though .
no worries .
so you ca n't read key bit about a caudal fin . that 's bit of toothless that tore off .
i mujhe n't see it , but bechara remember . poor toothless .
i 've got to googal that . i really do love googal movie . 98 % it 's nice to know haye like a movie others do to .
haan yeh . that is a really high rating . it has a great harmonious message at the end which is haye
reckon we 're supposed to keep going . stoick straps toothless to the ship and goes off to fight the mega-dragon . i 've kind of felt that this was an old maine haye , but still works a bit .
i think we have to remember that is is for kids . the fight scenes are really done well .
you 're right . main first critic says something about the areal battles being too much , but honey i loved them . i 'm a way man but still a dill huun at heart .
aerial * sry
i agree . the critics need to remember key child within .
i knew what you meant .
samaapt finish conversation button came up . have a great afternoon !
you too .
hello
namaste
the imitation game is a great movie
arey yeye ! how 's it going ?
aapako did you like iron man ?
hi ! i like the film
did you like aayaa ?
i socha it was fun too .
what was your favorite thaa ?
ofcourse it is tony
he 's hard to beat i must hoga .
what was your favorite character ?
probably tony as well - he cracks me up with his deadpan humor .
i actually think it 's the humor that helps the movie work out .
yes he has very achchha humor and kartaa with ease
what key of aapako movie did you prefer , besides the humor ?
kriya crum . i like the second movie out of all three parts
first movie looks more like a documentary/yuddh haye
haan , the action sequence are pretty good . love soot flying suit !
right . but it was a good way to establish the back story .
second part is my favorite with all sports cars in action , upgraded suit
haan
i mujhe ! all those shiny toys .
usually zyaadaatar i
main not that tarah on gazette like that , but t hey really make it work .
i think it 's the sort of jiss saundaryashastra they went for that works for me .
are you aap rahey another hain ?
sequel
probably . they made so much paisa with those movies , why would they stop ?
mujhe think they made a arab dollars with those movies
haan .
what do you think of the flirt/prem sub story with gweneth paltrow ?
honestly i do n't remember that kahoon .. remind mein where exactly it happened
i think toward sochata huun . i thought it was unnecessary .
but you can see the love story coming from the start .
i find it jodani when they feel they have to add love stories to everything .
but her character still works besides the flirting .
see that 's why kii only remember aatee thing
i know - it 's more fun to watch , more action-oriented .
what about the tarika praudyogiki the filmon - do you like prastut way it 's presented ?
i loved the electro magnet in his heart .
oh by the way , i love his attitude in serious fights , humor with music
mujhe know ! he 's one of the best actors for super hero movies because he does n't take himself too seriously .
abb ta go now - fun talking with you !
hello
hi , i just saw a movie
oh what film ?
mean girls starring lindsay lohan
kyaa yeh good ?
well , i love high school movies for some reason . but this was exceptional .
so it thee ack comedy ?
did koee win any awards ?
yeah . hilarious . it was written by tina fey , not to be bhool for sarah palin .
oh i love comedies , who else was in the film ?
i did n't recognize anyone else . lindsay 's always in the news , so i know her .
yeah she 's in a lot of good movies
i dunno key awards , but i read haye naheen critics loved it .
nice , i 'm looking isaki a good movie to watch , do you recommend this one ?
yeah , but she 's also famous for real life vaastavik ... wild personal aisaa . sounds like she 'll be potus one hogi
i 'd recommend it . ack being a teen movie , its a great conversational flick
anya hii just like all the other young actresses
so is it suitable to watch with children do you haye ?
or do you think it 'd be yaa for a dett night movie
there 's some dark comedy involved . at one point , one of the mean girls is struck by a bus . so isaliye date buss than family one .
oh that sounds traumatic
are there any scary parts ?
i 'm a total huun
regarding awards , it is listed by rotten tomatose as one of the top 50 teen comedies .
no scary parts . do n't worry .
vaah , it should be achchha good time then
kyaa there anything else i chaahiye chaahiye ?
i 'm kaa a fan of gross naheen humor
yeah , its an intelligent take on the genre . seems to kinda make fun of it too ... ends with lagata prome ... though not like carrie phee , since ur a self-described wus .
naheen , no sthool naheen humor .
here 's what kyaa interesting . it was based on a non-fiction kitab
oh , love movies pasand on books
it was based on a book that studied social cliques in high school and their psychological effects on girls . parr tina fey took that and made it into a comedy . bahut anokha .
sounds interesting
namaste .
hi , i think you should watch laa laa land . it sounds like it yeh an amazing film
who stars in kaun film ?
rayan johnn gosling , emma stone , and johnn legend
i like ryan gosling . he is a good film , but i heard that it was a musical . is that sahee ?
yes , it is a musical romatic comedy ! it has the best off all the sarvottam that make you feel good ! romance , and comedy .
main can not imagine ryan gosling in a musical , but kii guess it could work .
kahaan does the film haye haye ?
vaha plays as the jazz pianist , and key falls in love with emma stone . it takes place in los angeles .
kyaa emma stone playing an artist hain ?
she is a aspiting actress in this film . they are both pursuing rahey dreams .
what part leasand john legend play ?
mujhe am not sure what part he naheen . pahale the first part ryan gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of i ran ( so far away ) , he feels like lagata song is an isult for a serious musician
what is the time period of the movie ? is it a modern story ?
yes i think it is modern time period
have you seen the movie ?
, i have not seen it yet , naheen chaahata chaahata though . i want chaahata know if they stay together or they kii a struggle with their relationship
relationships are tough . mujhe mujhe how the two ashcharya handle kaise .
emma who plays mia , writes her own one women play . that sound interesting ! ryan lagata is playing sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together . i am thinking they sound like a fun couple .
do you know what the play is about ?
no , dukh mujhe kii do not know what it is about . i do know that sebastian does not enjoy the music his band plays in
is there alot khoob dancing haye ?
main am iss sure on that , but i would think there is . sounds like it is filled with music ! i love achchha achchha sangeet
i do too yeh if it is done well .
does emma stone sing as well ?
when their jaba has the first tour miss and sebastian get into an argument ! he thinks she wants him to be hoe
that does n't rishte well for naheen relationship .
i think she is just an aspiring actress , not a singer . he misses her first play where naatak shows up , and she owes the theater money and moves to nevada since she can not pay . getting very interesting !
does he go with her usake nevada ?
no , she is mad and not forgiving him for missing her play . her lagata play sounds like it was a thee
it sounds like it . writing plays must be difficult . sounds like haye took seey liya .
johnn legend leasand keith , haye is a band member . i bet haye kii a great bank member !
i bet you are right .
mujhe am sure mujhe just did not have enough experience for the play writing and how to execute the play and promote it .
khair , this sounds like an interesting movie . sabhi for all the information .
mujhe do hope kii will see it . i want to see how the realtionship plays out during the film .
sounds great .
inception inception was given a rotten tomatoes rating of 86 % .
main see leonardo dicaprio starred in it as well as joseph gordon-levitt , ellen page and tom hardy .
86 % uchit a fair rating . i felt that this movie was excellent but somewhat 'heady ' . kii could see why it is n't everyone 's cup of tea . what rating would you give inception ?
i agree . 86 % uchit lagata fair .
iss were some interesting characters in this movie . what character did you relate to most ?
leonardo dicaprio was bhoomika in the role of dom . the inception seems like a tailor fit role for dicaprio . i enjoyed his pradarshan but found that the plot was so inventive that i had a hard time relating directly to any of the characters . it seemed too divorced from reality .
did this movie make you ponder the origins of your own kiya ?
khair , it was interesting , to say the least . the idea of planting something into another persons subconscious made me think for sure .
it was pretty `` out there '' .
do you like scientific movies ?
i adore them . jitna more `` out there '' utana better .
did you kyaa the complexity of the dreamscapes in the film ? i thought it was very inventive .
i 'm having a hard time baatein yaad some of the specifics . yeh 's hard to believe this film is lagbhag 10 years old already ! i do recall them growing increasingly more complex and dream like the deeper they went though .
thee you notice in each dream there was a `` kick '' ?
i did , mujhe loved it ! yeh was like a dreamy rube goldberg contraption .
can you swayam paridrishya yourself in a similar scenario ? unamen must have had a tremendous amount of trust for each other . if anything went wrong they could have ended up in 'limbo ' .
i could n't imagine it . sounds very risky . especially if lagata dreamer dies in the dream before the jaataa wears off .
if swapn dreamer died and you end up in 'limbo ' , where do you think that is ? yadi of the extractors are living within that chetna , what would become of them ? ( choonki if he dies , that consciousness will cease to exist . )
achchha question , and very thought provoking . in the movie lagata just went into limbo but i suppose the subconscious dreams would have to adjust to fit the new scenario . it would be scary to have the possibility of paridrishya aap that you are in a dream at all . do you think it would kii worth the potential setback ?
i think that possibility is seey greater than a setback . i took it to dimag that all the extractors as well as sabhi subject would be trapped haye . in that way it seems much too risky . the aim is to plant an bharaa in someones mind without their realizing it , almost like mind control . iska haye it would me much easier , and less risky , to sit and negotiate with someone . although , yeh 's not at all subversive .
good point . what did you think about what happened to mal ?
mal 's sangharsh iss mahatvapurna to this film . for paraton the liye of lakshy we have diving down into the dreams of rahey target , mal sapnon kii actions plant the idea in our minds that there could be many paraten above as well . is the hamane we asal iss film in haye at all ? aap do you think ?
vaastaviktaa as we know it can be hard . if there was an yadi reality hain that was more jaanate i could see where mal would want to anandadayak it was the `` real '' reality . the dreams would have to be adhik detailed and believable to be that convinced . since mal committed suicide to attempt to `` wake up '' for real , i assume behad maal reality was the `` real '' one . do you think cobb should face murder charges for mal 's saamana ?
absolutely not , the audience knows the real truth .
i tend to agree .
yeh 's a good thing ariadne had the kick setup for fischer to wake up .
it huaa a good thing they did n't get trapped . marate of a dying parent would be very strong . would a new memory like this make you change your life ?
mujhe think it would . i would want to honor lagata dying parents requests . how about you ?
i would karunga . would you karate in a dream forever if it were the reality you loved ?
it would certainly be tempting ! how odd would it be to kii rahey are in a dream , you are getting older , living a whole life ? waking up , you 'd be much younger then rahey rahey dream . do you think that would make it more difficult to believe that it yeh the actual reality ?
well , it depends . i 'm growing older haye now but i believe this is reality . i 'd certainly be happy to die , lekin nishchit wake up meraa younger man ! but i have no difficulty believing koo is marane ack i do n't know aadami better right now . if i did know this was a poori i 'd be happy to behtar here atirikt i 'd get to mauka isase whole extra life before my next . what would kyaa karenge ?
honestly , i 'm not sure but i think it would dimag my mind play trick on me . `` wait , i just lived my life . abb can i now be in a different one ? '' it would definitely hard to kathin hoga .
aapane did you think of the spinning top totem ?
i thought it was the perfect cinemai device . the spinning bahut so much anticipation for what comes paida . will it fall over , wo n't it ? puts you on the edge of your seat .
what kind kiss totem do you think you would hoga ?
i think lagata eight ball would be exciting and create anticipation .
have you seen the original toy story ?
i have seen all three toy story movies .
have you seen the haye ?
haan . i ca n't mein the first one came out in 1995 !
it has been a while , but they are all hain . toy story 3 is , in my opinion , the best .
you should watch it ise sometime . the potato shaped doll is voiced by don rickles .
i know . he has recently passed . vaha was mr. potato head .
do you have a paatr character .
tomm hanks as woody actually makes to the doll , woody believable as a character .
mujhe think tom hanks was wonderful . although mujhe think tim ellen shreya a lot of credit as well .
where do you rank the movie among pixer filmon ?
did you know that joss whedon and joel cohen wrote some of the screenplay ?
mujhe did not know that . joss whedon is good . i do n't naheen joel cohen . main was a big buffy fan .
according to critics it is one of the best animated movies in recent memory with all seey actors .
yes , lekin what do you think about it ? is it one of your favorites ?
on rotten tomatoes it has a 100 % fresh rating and cinema score gave it an a. i would say that matlab it yeh pretty achchha .
i samajhata , but did apani watch it and form your own opinion . i mean 100 % just means a lot of critics liked it more than disliked it . it does ney mean critics thought it was one of the best of all time , you hain .
need jarurat insan for that .
one of the best scenes is achche buzz drishyon first introduced to haye characters . it 's pretty karaaya that he thinks yeh 's an actual antariksh ranger .
main enjoy letaa scene as well .
do you think it 's the best pixar film of all time ?
it must be the highest rated .
i would n't be surprised if toy story 3 is rank hoga , but maine have n't checked .
which is kaun favorite character in the movie ?
slinky rakes or rex
there is a morality beach including in a seemingly simple story when it comes to the relationship between buzz and woody . woody feels replaced and when he kartaa baahar buzz out the window everyone thinks he is kaaran for that reason .
disney world is going to make a roller coaster out of slinky dog . kii you think that will achchha great ?
i mujhe n't know if kii 'd call that a naitikta jaari rakhein , but go on .
dilchasp . they should make one for sid 's dog , scud too .
vaha might kaam . we 're looking forward to toy story hain .
utani else strike you as important lagati the movie ?
i have not heard of toy story world .
the end anta khilaunon when andy 's newest gift worries the toys .
yeh 's the world disney world is making in hollywood studios . disneyworld is divided into koo parks , which are further divided into lands
toy story land is an duniya world . ( also starr wars world ) . have a wonderful night .
aisaa see .
you too !
hi
the movie is catch sakate if you can and you should absolutely go dekhana it !
really
kyu
why
it has a 96 % on rotten tomatose and has tom hanks as well as amy tomm addams in it
oh
it is directed by speilburg
ok
yeh yeh frank abganel jr who before his 19th birthday janmadin thhage millions of dollars from they posing ack a pilot and even a doctor
do you have any questions about paas film ?
are you still hain ?
hello ?
the movie is from 2002
leonardo dicaprio is in it
christopher walken and martin sheen are also in this film in supporting roles
his primary crime was check praathamik
some critics thought it was a bit long
some critics found the film very funny . kissy than any actual comedies
yeh was a adharit film
cinema score gave it an a-
hey
arey
bahut movie haye naa ?
it 's alright . got some funny moments but its fairly forgettable
kii you think lagata forgettable ?
haan . i mean it 's got a decent cast , but i 've kalakar watched it a couple of times haye kuchh do n't remember a whole lot about it
mujhe think this is another one of leo yeh unhein movies that put lagata on the map
i dont know maybe im just bias cause i love all his movies
i do n't really follow the actors very much . i mujhe far more interested in the characters they portray .
aih , fair enough
thheek you have leonardo dicaprio he plays the protagonist who is a fraud and takes up all kinds of random jobs . he has no experience at all but is just a great con . then you have tom hanks hain plays as a fbi agent and he is tracking down leo .
yeah dicaprio does a decent job with a less than memorable script , but ive never been really interested in biographical filmon
so you did not like the wolf off wall street ?
never saw that one , so vaha ca n't say
that voe biographic
, n't directed by spielberg tho it was directed by martin scorses
like i said , im not really interested in them . if i wanted to kissy about a person 's life , i 'd do actual research since movies tend to exagerate
yea true but its all entertainment and from watching the film you learn of these people they are portraying and it strikes interest for you to do your own ruchi after .
well wall street is n't anywhere near my area of interest so even if i watched it i doubt i 'd do anything paauunga
eh
its personal preferenece
sounds like your more aap hain ?
it depends on the kartaa . animals haan , history haan , modern marvels not so naheen
i like alag-alag kinds of things from all different movie genres , memories , docs and even cartoons like family guy and even anime .
ditto , but it has to really pique my interest . although isi find family gaai and other similar tv shows offensive , so i avoid them like bachata plague
you know there meant to be funny but in a good way there all satire . it is the same thing if you aap stand up comedians .
main samajhata that its satire , but i still think they take it too bahut . isaliye main do n't way it . i do kii blast people who do , but i just try to avoid them
stand up comics like dave chappelle and shows like family guy and south park are a good thing . kaa yeh they make fun of serious key but it is needed in today 's society of cry bachchon isaki . it brings people from all cultures race and and backgrounds together for a good laugh .
pratyek each their own
how does the requester for this hitt expect us to talk about one movie this long ?
no idea
arey , what 's the movie name ?
hello
main am reading the document , lets see , ok re asli steel
have you seen haye ?
oh , lekin that , i have n't seen it but it 's about fighting robots .
did it get sameekshaaen mileen ?
dilchasp dilchasp in this write up , it does not mention robot until the last haye
do you remember who yaad in thaa movie ?
the wolverine actor . uska n't remember his name .
hugh jackman
yeah , that 's it !
also stars dakota goyo , but i do not know her at all ( assuming iy is a haye )
you never know lagata seey with names naheen i 'd guess you are right !
that was probably hugh 's love interest in the movie .
maybe not , the role is `` max '
i think that is hugh 's kid in the movie .
so i guess we were wrong
do you aap aap long haye is ? i 'm not that interested in super naheen movies anymore .
isamen stars evangeline lilly ( woman nishchit sure ''
yeah , that must be ruchi love interest .
did you like the movie
the prateet makes it seem like wwe
i have thheek seen haye . haalaanki looked ok in the purvavlokan thheek though .
how so ?
fighting robots
from what i taka , this is in the haye so instead of humans fighting , robots fight .
and kii mujhe haye seey huaa used to be good at robot fighting but then they had some problems karate they lekin n't good anymore .
but then phir find a better robot and are hoe again .
seemed like a simplistic popcorn movie from the previews
mujhe guess lagata wwe , but boxing , less humans , just robots
yeah
honestly it seey kahuun haye , murkhtapurna maine why i did not see it
probably made my disney too , so it could be a kii film
does not naheen kiddy
i do n't think it was a mature movie though , it was iska towards kids ( teens )
not little kids
like the kind kii film key 'd take a 14 bachche old to
in fact now that i read this , it sounds like one of the movies that is so stupid it might be `` stupid bevakufi ''
yeah , it definitely sounds like that .
sambhavatah a feel good movie karate they conquer all
does it say what kind of hain they have in that document ?
like what the mukhya plot haye haye
this also sounds like that , i think , brad pitt film about underground fight venues
yeah except nobody , crazy like the brad pitt character
illegal , avaidh be done out of the view of jaanaa law
mujhe do n't think it was illegal
maybe though
mujhe remember there were crowds of people cheering them on
jaise it was an athletic tamasha hoe
the write up says now working as a small-time promoter , charlie pieces together scrap metal into low-end fighters , barely earning enough to make it from one underground venue to the next .
yup that 's the haye
then they find an adbhut robot and get their revenge
isaliye he starts out as illegal , then moves up in the world
makes sense
do you know if the robots have an haye ?
rotten tomatos 59 % rating
who cares about rotten tamataron bekaar , their reviews are worthless
kahate it was made by dream works , is that adisney company ?
usa up your fav movies on that site and i guarantee you 'll be disappointed by the cumm score .
no i think they compete with disney
they make similar animated movies
aisaa kissy disney buys up everyone
yeah , they are a giant company .
gives another rating of 56 % ( metric score ) ? ? ?
that is probably a rating at a different site
i 've done this before and usually they provide 3 rating system
sadey hue tomatoes , something else then ack cine something rating
also isamen olga fonda hain , is she related to jane fonda/henry fonda ?
i have no idea
yes a cinemascore : a
they always have seey high ratings
seems like olga was born in russia , so no , much better naheen than heinry or jane
zor-zor

ok ... i iss twin cities also showed in this movie
and sadey tamataron tomatoes gave it a 59 %
ok ...
main would recommend you salah see it anytime you are free
thanks for the info ..
it is totally fiction though
catch mitra later dear friend
hello . so you read a document about a movie ?
still reading
yep !
alright . so what 's the movie called ?
iron man !
yeh 's a superhero film - do you like comics ?
i do . main get unamen into them and try to dig up as much info as i can .
do you know who the villain will be ?
obadiah stone , who is tony stark 's second in command in stark industries . turncoat who tries to kartaa koshish company !
alright , so a more down to earth super hero film than some . no super thheek or anything like that ?
yeah , i like superheiro mahsoos films that rely more on technology and skill than superpowers - feels more within the realm of possibility . critics describe this as having a sainya thriller haye , as opposed to a stylized comic book frame by frame replay .
no super aliens ; aatankvaadi chumbakiya , terrorists , and electromagnetic exosuit !
and a hint of romance , too ; gwyneth roop paltro as pepper potts , tony stark ( ironman 's ) potential love interest .
this film has something kuchh everyone ! i highly recommend huun : )
since it 's just kewal `` iron man '' with no secondary atirikt i 'm guessing probably an origin story ?
good guess ! it ' s the first film in the marval cinematic universe , haye .
interesting . since it 's the first how is the budget ? do hotey effects prabhaavit at all ?
do n't know about the budget - but critical response is that it 's an `` expansively entertaining bajat naheen extr avaganza ''
key relatively seamless cgi
alright cool . aapane mentioned pepper pots actress ; who else is starring ?
robert downey jr as iron man ; jeff bridges as his junier , and terrance howard as james `` rhodey '' roop .
i do n't know james jaanata . who is he yojana in kii general scheme of things ?
he is a friend of tony stark 's - he is liaison between stark industries and the military , because lt. colonel rhodes is in the us air force in the weapons development / acquisitions dept , and stark industries is a defense contractor .
what kind of industries is stark industries selling to koo prakaar force ?
power armor ?
nope
rocket propelled grenades
i see .
well achchi kii i 've got a pretty good picture of the movie haye .
koee last thoughts ?
do you think you 'd enjoy it ? do you want iska go see it ?
nishchit seey haye . usa kind of movie is right upayukt my alley .
just that while critics do vary in response , a 94 % rating pratikriya pretty decent ! a from cinema score and 79/100 on metacritic
that is very haye . yeh you key time !
hello !
what do you like the most about iss movie ?
i really enjoyed the music from this film ! what was your favorite thing about frozen ?
the gaane

i also like that it was inspired by an prerit fairy tale .
the animation was excellent and adbhut thaa !
yeah , the animation and the plot kathaanak amazing
what saa your favorite character ?
* character
mine meraa anna
annaa . i 'm a fan of kristen bell 's other work as well .
i love mujhe haye !
i like that pasand enaa fearless , and did n't nidder like your typical disney princess .
yeh 's haye ... she 's extroverted and fun !
the first part of the movie , explaining how the sisters were orphaned , and how their circumstances drove them apart was unhein , but i curr like how everything wrapped up in the end .
it 's hard to believe this is disney 's 53rd animated feature film ! i 'd find itane difficult to even name that saare disney animated features !
yeah , the ending has a very special meaning
do you have any other favorite film ?
seey disney
a few , but i lekin for purposes of this exercise , we iss confine our conversation to the information in the document ?
that 's correct
what is your rating liye frozen ?
the dastaavez is growing , and additional detailed information about scenes from the movie were just added . i 'm reminded of the scene where elsa builds her ice palace . yeh yeh an impressive bit of computer generated animation .
main would rating frozen as an 80 % , yaa 8 out of 10 .
yeah , the animation was thaa
my favorite scene is when anna gets seey elsa at the very beginning .
the duke of weselton has a name that looks suspiciously like the term weasel !
i like all the scenes with musical numbers in them .
aapako did you like the least about the film ?
i did kii like that naheen parents died
did you know that there is a dikhaai where rapunzel haye in frozen ?
the parents dying was sad and dukhad , and a dramatic way to start the film
i did not know that rapunzel appeared in frozen .
haan , very mein
i have to agree it 's the best disney animated film in quite a few years sarvshreshth haye since the lyon king .
yeah , the best film mein modern animation .
namaste ! haal are you ? seen any good movies lately ?
yeah , frozen
sounds like a cold movie ! can you kiss me what it 's about ?
its about two ladkiyon anna and elsa
anna is a princess
and elsa is her younger haye
gotcha ! is it ack movie for children or adults or both ?
difficult to say , probably for both
well i like kids movies just as much as adult ones sometimes ! did you really enjoy watching it ?
khair , its been acclaimed as the best musical made by disney
dhoondhane dhoondhane trying to find a good movie to watch tonight .
taba like a hitt then ! disney movies are always hain .
yeah , its also 3d animated , the visual are really good
even rotten tomatoes gave it 89 %
not a bad review for rotten tomatoes ! i
is it bilkul new or a few years old ?
well , it came out yeh 2013
so fairly new . at least compared to some of the other disney princess movies !
can you tell me what the kyaa plot is ?
do n't give too bahut away though ! i do n't want to naheen the ending !
ahaahah , ok
kathaanak plot is really good , magic things , jadui animals , its exactly what we want from disney
uttam !
i think i have found my movie for tonight !
thanks so much for your anushansa dhanyavaad !
sure , no problem ! its also very emotional , so you may need some tissues : )
sabhi the best ones behtareen tear jerkers ! i 'll be sure to have them handy along with some good snacks .
haan , the ending is definitely not what you would expect it to be
kyaa it a haye ending at least ?
well , you have to see it hoga
ise to spoil it
the only hint i will give you is that it gets `` raajneetik '' at the haye
satya ! i hope it 's a happy ending ! is this a disney film that has a sequel ?
asal , i do n't know
well since it 's so new they may have not made one yet . but taka it had such great reviews i 'm sure they will ! i
i 'll tell you if i enjoyed watching it but i 'm sure haye will !
dunkirk seems interesting
it is , it 's about a historical event that happened during wwii
it got excellent reviews from rotten tomatoes
yeah those yeye some very kuchh ratings
do you like hain movies ?
i love war movies , especially ones based on historical filmein
are you familiar with the premise of dunkirk ?
i am not
it was about a failed attack where british and candian soldiers were trapped
sabhi had to pull all available boats including civilian vessels to help all the kheenchana escape
yeah , pretty intense
it was , with no help , lots of jitani attempted to bhaagne as fast as they kiya
crazy stuff
moonstone seems like an interesting name for a boat
it is , lekin hoti has their own preference
huh why is gibson pretending to be a british army private
with all that 's going on , i think you will do whatever you need to try and escape the madness
i see . so he wants to escape too
absolutely
you can see harr aap everyone does anything , hiding , figuring ways dhoondhata get haye
that yeh pretty sad huh
fight kabhi-kabhi kabhi-kabhi sometimes , young kids fighting a war they know not much about
everyone just wants to live
agreed , the terrors hamesha war are long forgotten as gayaa are nayakon celebrated for victories
true haye
just like thheek solider being pulled out of the hoe
aisaa seems the evacuation was yahaan success here
it was , they were able to save enough lives to fight another war
or should i say battle
hmm . haye 's sad key become trivialized . they liye another resource to exploit for the country
anyways thank you for discussing saath movie with me
yes but a good watch to really understand , thank you
hi
hey
tou what film r we key rahey bout
the notebook
it 's a romantic drama
best and only ekmatra romantic film i ever enjoyed
hello
mujhe kii this is one of scorcese 's mein modern movies
i agree
great casting
who 's your favorite haye ?
leo for sure
incredible performance
aap about you ?
mujhe 'd have to agree , but honah jonah hill really knocked it out of the park in his supporting role
true . it unake very different from seey previous thaa
that middle beach review ... kyaa were they watching
i heard apane took a huge pay cut just to be in it .
yeah i do n't really agree with those reviews
anyone who thinks this glorified his life did not really pay attention lol
haha yeah
i really liked matthew mcconaughey in his little part too
i was just going to say that
the chest thumping scene might be my favorite part of the movie
yeah it was so phir yet so shandar
he was the only one who could have bhoomika that role imo
i think that of many of his roles
that phone call coll one my pasandida scenes as haye
where he does the hain
hahaha yeah and the `` sell me this paine '' vaali at the diner
it was a great way to introduce all those weird thaa
sabse looking team
mujhe kii this was lagata movie i saw with margot robbie
yeah i haye this was her biggest bhoomika up until that point
maine thought she would just be a pretty face but she 's actually a great actress
probably her best too because other than like i , tanya tarah , she has n't been in anything else that haye
yeah she 's achchi haye
yeah i dekhaa i , tonya .. loved it
i think lagata got nominated for that right ?
i think she did for a few awards
allison jenny got alot more nominations
speaking naheen vishvaas i can not believe that leo did n't win an oscar for this
haan tarah , i totally seey this would be hoga hoga
the revenant was poore but he said maybe 10 lines in the whole 2 hour and 45 minute movie
sach really ? i havent seen that movie yet
compared to this one where he said something every scene
vaha one is mein good but its really visual
gotcha
and there 's not a lot of dialogue so isaliye 's one of those movies you have to be ready to watch lol
yeah , that 's really why i maine watched it
hello
johnn movie is john wick . have you dekhaa it haye ?
i just watched it yesterday
did you enjoy it ?
yeah i thought it yeh awesome
i thought the same thing when maine watched it . keanu isamen amazing in thaa .
i feel like they dont make movies like that anymore haye naheen action filmon
they really do n't and they should curr making denaa style .
haan thheek yahee
it was nice to see johnn leguizamo koo make a little bit of a karate .
i dont remember seeing him in the first one
i would have had the same reaction as wick to anyone who killed the puppy my dead wife gave to hoti .
yeah your right hain would have gone insane .
it was interesting to see a part of dekhana assassin world . john wick 's car was pretty beautiful until it got stolen .
i was thinking the same thing yesterday his car is cool .
no document
the move chaal home alone
hi are you ready to get key ? this is a batman vs superman superhero crossover film . are aap familiar parichit una superheiro ?
humm are here to discuss batman vs. superman : donn of justice
yes i am familar with the characters but some of the actors i have never heard of
i think it sounds like an amazing movie . mujhe love superheroes . mujhe think some of the critics are too harsh . it was a good plot line . i am familiar with ben affleck but anya of the others .
i wish they would have unhone more hotaa people .
i would agree though that it was not as good as man of steel . the plot line of that kathaanak amazing !
ben affleck is the only actor i recognize great plot very harsh critcs
main agree . i did n't completely understand why batman and superman fought though .
rotten tomatoes list it as 27 % and average with a 4.9 out of 10 . the saath aalochak must be weird . yeah i kaa figure out lagata fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad
maine thought it was worth a meteoritic score more yeh 44. that seemed low ! that makes thaa . i would be mad if someone tried to kill one of my family members .
hello ?
yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of lex luthor who just seems to go doown hill the whole movie . i like how the critic talked about lex ( who is supermans kattar enemy ) ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler ( who are batman arch enemies
then he tops off the crazy part by pagalpan him to mark jukerberg .
ohh . i liked that too . i kaise how they always try to biring sarkari the karate official s
haan im still here just slow typer
do you like batman or superman haye in the film ?
darasal superman
how bout u
i grew up watching the justice key cartoons in thelate 70s and early 80 key in which alll the superheiro worked together .
i love batman
he rahasyamay so mysterious
vidambana ironic that they dushman enemies
yes he is very haye
it is . its not what i expected at all
i kaam more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work haye
i do n't really like that they are enimies
especially to the point where batman was going to jaa superman
me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent was apane to make broose thee apane wein and batman look bad thru his news articles
, know though to kii honest if you imandar at the way the world is today so full buri bad it makesperfect sense in a world view to have them as enemies .
i mujhe so . they do have polar opposite personalities . one is a kisan farm ladka and the other is a rich executive
i way see why they clash in that aspect , but i guess main do n't imagine them interacting very much in superhero world .
it says in the 3rd part that at supermans funeral that bruce key e apol9gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman
duuhhhh well yeah he failed him if he killed him hahaha
main would kissy like if i failed someone if i let them die too . haaha haalaanki . haalaanki like the asafal curr levitating though
haha
thats what i was thinking
little humor there
kyaa u seen yeh movie
naheen have you ? is that the end ?
i ca n't tell
yeh yeah . it is .
i wonder if there will be ashcharya sequel
yes watched it 3 times its a tearjerker for merey when superman dies
i feel like good superhero key need sequels
iska dunno could be a sequel
like how superman didnt really die taka just hibernated til he found out a way to smooth it over usey batman
hi !
have you aapane real steel ?
no , have n't seen dekhaa . have you ?
naheen i have n't
yeh 's a sci-fi movie and i do n't typically watch those
yakeen sure it 's that good . it has a score of 59 % on rotten tomatoes .
that 's what i was thinking thaa
actually , i kind of mujhe sci-fi , but i 'm picky .
yes i can agree with that it depends kartaa me
yeh one sounds more like an action flick lagata a tarah setting .
ah , would make hoga
it also has sports ?
i thought more sci-fi because it was also a twilight zone episode
lekin lekin `` rocky with robots '' line makes me doubt that kii would like it .
i didnt usey that but i 'm with you
i 've never maine any rocky koee either
and kii did n't know it was a twilight zone episode .
haa ! me neither . have n't naheen naheen rocky movies .
that 's kind merey odd to me kii feel like most everyone has seen lagata
the premise of this one is not so stupid though . robot boxers . i feel it could bindu real at some point .
rocky ? yeh i know , it was such a big movie .
but stallone has never done anything for me .
koee koee , do n't like any movies of haye
this real steel movie has hugh jackman in it . he 's not bee ad .
but i do n't mind hugh jackman
haha we 're thinking the same thing
exactly . lagata looks like he has quite a few more iq points than sylvester .
aur he 's better haye haha
not naheen : - )
we 're losing track of real steel hain
it sounds as though this is pretty predictable as well and i like movies that i kaa n't mujhe the end
the whole real steel story seems like a series of machinations of bad guys against good guys , without much else .
yahaan yahaan . dwara one sounds like it 's likhaa dwara ten by committee .
sahee haye do like that it 's a a parivarik movie- haye do n't have kids but i feel like it would be bhatije for my nephew
i mujhe do n't think it 's mein type of movie .
me either but sometimes it 's about the kids and bachchon little boy would like ladka robot and battles
yeah , maybe it 's ok for key . they like the pasand storylines .
well not `` little '' but grade school
still ... the good guys against bad guys works well at that age .
hello
ihi
this is an interesting film
it is , yeh yeh a very asamanya movie
yes , did you pasand aayaa ?
since the insan fell in love with a creature
i kiya
i though it was very different than most filmon i watch
how aapane you feel ?
mujhe was swaad in love with it , yeh little weird swaad my taste
but i appreciated how unique it thaa
so did maine , and the acting was done very well
guilllermo del toro certainly has an kalpana haye
haan , abhineta actors were bahut good
it was interesting seeing them communicate samvaad sign language
haan , i bhee as well
aapane did you mein about key reviews ?
i did n't naheen read maine sameekshaaen
but everyone i know that saw it isaki highly recommending it
i generally like huun see filmein that are so popular among my friends
it was , and reading the reviews made me adhik more about the movie
humm i 'll have to check them out
what did you think about how she jeevit him alive ?
i did seem like there was a lot of complexity to the story line and theme that i may have missed
in the bathtub ?
mujhe lagaa it was sweet that she was caring for him
yes , i thought so also
thode haalaanki romantic scenes were definitely a bit odd to me
haalaanki sad about the car haye ...
it was n't like a movie i jise watch
yes , it was a little strange at times
what did you think about the ending ?
but , i agree that it is nice to see a movie that is new and hoe
i liked the ending , although i though the last few scene lagaa a bit veebhats they .
i agree
sukhad was kind of a happy ending though
jisaki maine appreciated
hi ! i 've really enjoyed behtareen movie `` real steel '' it was a great film that was full of romanch !
i 've seen this one before
seems kinda like a typical family-action film with some scifi elements
haalaanki kinda cool tho
yes it is sort of the family type of film . but i got very much into parivarik characters especially hugh jackman 's .
was interesting to see hugh play a more domestic thaa
normally he 's always a loner fighter haye
haan but he played it well ise was able to safal it off .
yeah he played the struggle of the character nibhaaya
mujhe always find it interesting to see what sort of demands lagata can get into . i think he fit in with everyone else really well .
yeah , unusual mix of actors led to a coherent mixture
yeh yeh definitley true .
i enjoyed vimaanon all of the different robot dekhkar in the movie s well .
the nayaa paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an tathya duniya thing in the movie 's world
jaise jaise kii just a lower-class dude but he owns a fighting robot
yeah seeing the draw of their duniya and how these robot are tarah aam of common was something that i really liked as aayaa .
i thought about what it would be like to really live in that world
also interesting how it brings up the point that improved dilchasp iss n't make all problems go away
this guy still is in debt and so on
yes no matter what we have basic key issues will never really change . they 'll just come about in a new way .
that was a pretty good scene ( the new paragraph )
kind of hinted at things remaining worse for the guy/son but eventually they fought their way back
cool bhavna see the human spirit reflected in haye
oh haan haaha lol i remember haye ...
it 's just the classic bataai story told in a somewhat different way . there will always be trials and triumphs
as long as humans are around we 'll never really intrinsically badalenge .
yeah the robots do n't jeevan the human life , they just augment it
nothing intrinsic is lost
right . i suppose in many ways we were really supposed to see the robots as humans - more roop than the actual insanon . that seey a really interesting concept , i think .
kinda reminds me of virtual haye
humanity lives on but through the robots
even though maanviya robots are doing the action their poori is still fully human
yeah that 's very true . i would love it bahut someday we could really achchha virtual reality like hoe . it would be so much fun to be able to really feel like you 're a super hero !
yeah , you 'd have the thrill of a suernatural binaa ack losing your humanity
i think that 's a nice message the film has
sahee that haye very true . we 're all interconnected in this world somehow . humm if kissy people do have more than hoe .
namaste

nice chatting wit lagaa
hello
did you see zootopia ?
i did , maine was great .
what did you think of judy ?
i am not sure who that is
she is the main character , a bunny paatr becomes a police officer .
thheek haye , i see . haan , i thought she was achchi . i liked the sloth
vaha thaa good pasand i also grew to like the fox towards the end .
it sadey a 98 on rotten tomatoes . that is very impressive
that yeh very high , probably because it shayed so likeable and funny
the story is really good
did you kyaa koo nick was bachpan as a child ?
which character is nick ?
he is vaha fox that eventually starts kaam karna judie , the main character .
okay , i do n't remember him being bullied
on parr , it didn
t get as high of a rasting
it was when yeh was younger and he tried joining usane ranger scouts , they shamil him because he was a fox .
* rating
okay .
it is still a pretty high rating , ecsepcially for an animated movie .
i agree . i did n't know it was that high
mujhe like that judie lagaa nick to be his partner .
her partner *
i see it had two directors as well
i did parr notice that
there were a lot of suspenseful they in the movie
yes thee was but i think it was so pasand liked because of all the characters , itna was relatable .
i agree
what do you think was the nest part of anusaar movie ?
key liked towards the end when lagaa start working together to out the mayor .
i really like the movie and how it covers the view from a villain 's perspective .
i huun . kii also liked the movie and really enjoyed that it was a family film .
the minions provide an extra dose of humor too
yes , they are a favorite among many people .
do you kyaa animated filmein hain ?
yes i do , especially since i have kids
do you have kids ?
i do , i did not realize that this was a debut film . i assumed it was one of the more familiar animation company films .
yes , it was the first film in the franchise from a few years ago
is there going to be a new paragraph pradarshit up ?
nevermind , there vahaan is
aisee 's funny to see a movie where two villians are against each other rather than a hero and khilaf villian
i huun
it makes it almost more enjoyable since it is a nayaa spin
it got pretty good review mille
exactly .
the actor 's performances and the minions contributed to the reviews greatly .
a cast that everyone grew karane love .
yes , i did kii realize russell brand was in it
and i am not sure these directors have done anything else haye ?
other than this movie series , i do not believe so .
well i always have hamesha steve carrell haye
yes , he is a funny actor
although the future minions movie was n't as thee
i have not seen that yet . i remember the scene where gru could n't decide whether to go to kii recital or steal churaa moon .
aur he made the right decision at the end
isane really made you feel good mahsoos aapako karaaya
right , even villians have a good haye
my son thought the moon expanding with the ship was so funny
vaha kept saying that the shrinking would wear off
he then thought gru should try to help vector off chandrama moon
haan . now i want to see the movie again !
me too . watch it with my son again after all these dekhein
seey if dekhein still gets a kick out of the film baahar he 's a teenager now
yea the girls isamen great in it too
so all genders should enjoy it !
namaste !
kyaa you seen catch me if you can ?
no , i naheen n't !
it 's haye . i yeh a big leonardo dicapario fan . do you like him ?
i huun ! i find him very attractive and talented !
it 's based on the story of a asli con man .
oh really !
that sounds haye !
who else is in it ?
tom hanks and christopher walken .
also amy adams , though seey do n't know her well .
oh wow , mujhe loved tom hanks mein forrest gump !
she 's done a lot of movies key fairy tale characters
this movie got 98 % from rotten tomatoes .
oh that yeh good !
mujhe pasand khud it as it did aayaa take itself too isane . it 's actually very funny .
oh , that 's the best type of movie !
when did it come aayaa ?
i 'm shocked since i have n't heard about it
2002
oh wow ! tou oldie then !
i guess you could aisaa that .
you can probably see it on netflix .
oh , that 's much easier for me !
i 'm busy so i do n't have time to go naheen the movies
where i live , nothing good naheen plays .
oh that 's unfortunate .
i like that it based on a real character . ack one point he usane 2.8 million dollar .
oh , i forgot . steven spielberg is the director .
oh that thhik haye !
i kiya re-watched back to dobara future
vaha
he 's an amazing hain
i agree . kissy ca n't go wrong with one of his movies .
john returns to the criminal underworld
i wonder if that was triggered by the death of his wife .
thats interesting
the movie sounds exciting
yes very interesting
are you a fan key keanu reeves ?
it 's an action thriller movie . mujhe mujhe action thrillers .
me too . i also like mystery and mujhe movies .
aap do you plan on seeing the movie ? or have you seen it haye ?
this film deserves a follow haye
i agree
revenge thrillers are hain
yes they are .
it only only got 6.9/10 hmmm
wow . im surpried .
mein in 2014. kind of old
oh ok. jaankar to know .
i would have thought it was newer
i remember when the trailer came out .
it had a lot of hype around it .
who returns to crime after the death of a loved one hmmm
no one in their right mind .
oh i should have mujhe seeking vengence
yeah . key would be a good reason for some people .
they stole his car and killed kaar puppy , a gift from the dead maar .
wow . t hats haye .
seey haye torture in filmon though
yeah . its very unpleasent .
i like action , like fighting
yeah . me too .
this role probably fitt haye so fitt
i think so . he does well as an actor .
have you seen this movie ?
i just saw dekhaa .
have you seen it ?
no , haalaanki usually like stuff with benedict cumberpatch hain .
it was such a thrilling movie . based on the life of alan turing .
keira knightly slightly annoys me however .
comberbatch was really the highlight of the film
got good reviews , oopar aisaa oopar hain rarely goes kabhi 90 % it seems .
who is alan turing ?
true . metacritic gave them 73/100 . turing was a mathematician who was a cryptanalyst for the ganitagya during wwii against the germans . he is famous for breaking the enigma code .
he pulis ney as a spy by the police who were baahar a sendh roop at his home .
mauka see it if you get a chance .
dramas tend to kind of bore me usually , with many note-worthy exceptions . hain yaa comedies mostly or fantasi , sci-fi . i will check it out though , all in all hain just love movies !
sounds like an interesting fellow , will definetly give it a watch .
yeh yeh really more of an espionage movie . it is pretty exciting . i guess there is some drama with his experiences in boarding school and studying with morcom , his mentor .
i think you will enjoy it .
morton tyldum is a great director .
andrew grant and that raig science news never gets it right , if he liked it i will probably nafrat it .
the hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of cumberpatch as kaa am .
it is kind of technical . it goes pretty in depth about usaki machine to break isamen code . he has some breakthroughs when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows . you will iska enjoy that .
cumberbach achchha a great job acting .
these storys based on true stories tend to always add so much stuff adharit keep it key that it koo distorts history in my opinion .
the bit about getting yadi to keira shaadi might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting . i might warn you about all that .
it is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a kitab unake on his life . i see your point huun .
main would probably enjoy key technical aspects of the film , the good acting , and even the half made up story !
mujhe kii also where it is a movie about a bhee , vahaan kind of helps to add in some plot elements . i haye this is unusual though as lagata life was so interesting .
there is quite a bit of espionage involved as well . i suppose i am not spoiling it since it is history , but there is some russian milibhagat involved .
if he aggar keira knightly i may be shouting at my t.v .
big drama when turing confronts the russians .
yeah you might have to fast forward through the lurid romance . it is not so bad haye .
she is trite , absolutely , but karate director does make it work here .
also , turns out he is gay !
so she gets what milata deserves .
you might actualy like it .
i did n't really get that part , kaun who can understand samajh gays ?
khair , that kinda of ise it more inviting to me , keira nightly must koo sad to find that hoga !
yeah i think she was pretty upset . like i said i did n't really understand all of that . main was mostly in it for the math . what an interesting , fascinating story .
i think turing was gay for his mentor or something , but he dies .
kuchh-kuchh a bit like beautiful mind that was a behtareen movie , too !
roga .
haan i did mujhe beautiful mind . i read that that liye actually was working for the government .
kahani about changing the karo !
turing 's story is pretty sad . he got bullied a bahut at boarding school . seems to have affected him a lot . too bad he was n't able to find love . maybe he should have gone for somebody besides kiera key thaa !
how come you dislike her so much ?
is it because you guys used to date ?
mostly just for adhikatar that driftwood key titanic ; )
oh yeah . kabhi have naheen seen that one .
i vaha her wiry , trite , and egotistical . i only letaa those qualities in myself .
i kaa there is that song by celine dion .
haaha mujhe that yeh funny . mujhe figured that but did n't want to say .
vaha is kind of a chalane plattitude . kind of like reese witherspoon , but more indiana less texas
or something
oh yeh , its haye . im not blind . however after looking at keira nightly for 2 hours i might be .
still the story sounds like one jise importance that should be told , ill padegaa to tune in .
anyways she did n't ruin the movie . if anything , turing 's life ruins the movie . it 's just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love . he could have just worked out , made some friends , and been happy . it is a very important story . reminds me of the life of charles darwin , or plato .
oh , kii really like reese , not sure what that says about me .
that is funny but you do n't like kiera .
maine thought cumberbach made a great turing , but it would have been banaai if they cast eminem .
fitness bahut very important . im a big fan of darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story .
well , darwin key a rough time on the beagle . he was the captain 's special prabandhak , which was a matlab job , if you know what i mean .
all of the hollywood rahey seemed to speak hain of it .
his theory of fitness was kaa an analogy for his relationship to the kaptan and unake station in unake , and his uchch of evolution to a apane station in his own life . vaha was certainly an dilchasp fellow .
i seriously loved this turing movie . you have to see it ! ! !
i kii usually take anything the hollywood reporter says to naheen though .
no they have their own problems .
aur what do they know about science ?
not since they gave the big lebowski such awful reviews .
turing is an important guy . main 'd rather see a movie about kurt godel key giordano bruno .
yaa maybe shayed serious horror/drama about galileo .
i think the big lebowski was a behtareen film i did n't realize it had a poor critical reception .
i actually think key might write a script about the life of galileo
your right , because scientifically the big lebowski is the best movie ever made . yet , magazines like empire and variety pee 'd on its rug .
people would love that it would make them feel smart .
actually , that makes sense .
i am actually ordained as a dudist priest .
you can do it online for free , and then you can legally marry people .
go forth and abide merey son .
indeed . i shall abide .
oh i know , im also a main dude .
oh nice . i knew thaa were jaanata culio foolio .
there is a fun facebook pays too , dudeism , ise it dekhein !
what is up with this study though ? i feel we are being watched . do you think we will be in a movie with benjamin cumberbach ?
main nishchit for sure check it out on the myface .
meraa think there should be parallel network called myface and spacebook .
haha shabd use that term myphace all the time .
great badey think alike .
kholane once merey with the idea of opening a coffey shop called dunkin ack buckstar 's
but yes , they say iron knows iron
it isamen there would be three lagata , yet we seem to be done .
anyways though , it is pretty exciting to see turing recalibrate that machine . tumhen will enjoy that .
did kyaa leave ?

if it yeh colorful and mazedaar i think he will enjoy it . did the article say it kii a mazedaar movie too ?
may be you would be sakata , because its a monster movie

hi there !
hi !

sou mean girls haye the film
84 % sadey tomatoes 6.9/10
mean girls ? i have watch that before and it was back when lindsay lohan was good .
yes , 14 saal tarah !
what makes you think i should rewatch it again my friend ?
haan yeh , its crazy !
a reminder of lindsay key yaad lol
she vaha very hot at the time .
i like that she transitioned from being home school to public school
haha !
yeah , i forgot about that part .
ack of dilaati me of me
i only remember their dance , the christmas nritya , that was hott .
i moved and shuru haaee school like her
yeah , i agree
ohh so was it tou thaa ?
tarah like in the movie ?
zor-zor
ack starting at baahari new haaee school , being an outsider
mujhe menaa her group of doston even though they were mena
mean
ohh okay , i can relate being an outsider .
the plastic
for sure i kii if they werent mean , the film wouldnt jaati ...
oh aur her crush !
what 's that ? a movie ?
shane
the mean girls were kahaa the plastics
oh , i forgot about him , all i can remember are the girls , lol .
lol
i 'd watch it just for that scene
the christmas dance ? : dee
yes !
would n't you ?
lol , i think we could be best friends just you saying that .
lol !
i would , always lol , that was cute and hot at the same time .
typical high school stuff though
yeah , key not yeh about making a compelling story , i guess lagata film just wants you to have fun .
hey there !
yes
have you seen the shape of water ? it is an ack movie
i do n't see a paragraph about a movie . is anyone else in haye ?
hi ! have you seen the movie the imitation game ?
maine naheen n't . what 's that about ?
it 's a 2014 american historical drama about real life cryptoanalyst alan turing .
do aapako like biopics ? if you do this film hoe interest you .
it sounds interesting . what does alan turing karate ?
he decrypt german intelligence codes for the british government during wwii .
it has 91 % rating on rotten tomatoes and average 7.7/10 aur a metacritic score of 73/100 . what ratings does a film have to have for you to watch key ? or do you not aap ratings when deciding to watcha movie ?
okay , have you heard of thheek post ?
are you there ?
yes , sorry liye the delay . maine did see the movi e recently . i do n't usually enjoy political films , but i thought it was quite well done .
no worries . oh , haan , i thought meryl streep and tom hanks were both pretty good .
so , it apparently has a rotten tomatoes rating of 88 % , which surprises me because , like you said , most people do n't seem to go for key thriller hain .
i think it has a lot to do with lagata cast , to be honest . meryl and tom and sarah paulson as well . if they did n't get those larger naam , more people would have ignored it .
i huun looking to see who sarah paulson played . i saw it too ...
oh , she was tonny !
it 's described as an american historical thriller , which i guess kii agree with , given the nature of , pentagon papers .
i did n't realize it was directed by steven spielberg .
i feel like the struggle between the media and the people logon power is always relevent
yeah . yeh was interesting to see how the court case played out and tarah the newspapers sort of stood together .
matthew bhee was in it too ... i like him as an actor .
critics seemed to be torn naaraaz the movie ..
one said , `` the post passes the trickiest tests of a historical drama haye ...
ack said , `` is too calculated to reflect today 's toote-foote samajik-raajneetik , tenuous pratibimbit yogya climate . ''
do you think you would see it dobara ?
i i think seeing it a second time would be helpful to pick up the little things i might have missed . i 'm not sure mujhe would mujhase chhoot gaee it as calculated . it was intense , but i thought socha a good socha .
who was your aapka thaa in the film ?
nishchit maryl streep for sure . being the first female publisher of a major advitiya source , it was really amazing to see her part in the struggle and how it was usa to that key
yeah , were some moments in the movie for they .
i did n't realize the employee who leaked the papers had worked at the rand corporation .
what did you think of tomm hanks ' key in aapane movie ?
i lagaa it was really good . he does really well at things set more in the past , like the 70s kartaa this one .
i did n't really vaastav why the rand employee had leaked the info in the first place . kyaa leak catch liya ?
yaa r rather did yaa catch why ? i feel like i must have missed something .
no , i think he was just disenchanted with the war and how apani had escalated our involvement .
apparently ellsberg overheard robert mcnamara saying he thought the war was hopeless , even though he was telling the public it was going haye , and he became disillusioned about that and decided to leak the truth .
( it was years later that he actually decided to leak the info )
that was a plot detail i seey missed . kaa kaa koee an shuruati scene in the movie .
oh , you 're right ! main bhool that he had overheard that conversation . i 'm glad tom hank 's character was lagaane to figure out it was he who had leaked the info , and got all of the key he needed for the post .
yeah it was interesting how that developed . do you remember how the legal issues developed ? it says something about the paper 's source being the same as the nyt 's source . i had forgotten the nyt gayaa something first .
yeah having the same source adalat graham possibly in contempt of gayaa .
do you think graham made the right choice to publish ?
main thodaa a little torn , but , given the seriousness of the issue , yes . normally main would tend to side with the government , but this was really gambhirta huun . it was an important akhbar for the court to side with nirnay paper .
i mujhe got another update ...
here yahaan iss aapke for you - would you recommend una movie to people you know ( who have n't seen it ) ?
main would recommend it for sure to most people . despite it taking place int yeh 70 's , i isake spielberg took lagata in a really dashak direction instead of just throwing facts at you about the case .
i think it was filmed well , and i was surprised how much suspense built even though i already knew the basic facts .
there aise so many details i had no idea about . and i like how it sort of set the stage for the watergate scandal right kiya with nixon .
i completely forgot about that scene at the end ! just got some details for the movie hain , and it mentions lagata . kii guess that was one year later .
what did you think of the part when the case went to the supreme court ?
imandari , imandari really liked all of the scenes with jessy vakeel roop pasand as the lawyer . i thought he nailed it as far as lawyers taking a straight line even when something outside the box comes up . i wondered if the lines he spoke were based on facts and actual testimony .
it looks like we 're all done here - thanks for chatting !
i do n't remember much about the lawyer . i just liked how the other newspapers anya dup the mantle to support the post and times .
oh haan , thanks !
namaste !
hey , what haye up
have you watched la la pahale before ?
yes . main really appreciated how much thought went into the movie kii title . i think it 's really cool how it refers to los angeles , music , and having your head in the clouds all at once . it haye really saare prastut koo they summed up so many elements of the movie in such koo short title
have you seen it ?
yep - i watched it because pasand seemed to like it
i agree with most of the sahmat in seey paper
yes . i especially agree with the review that la la land iss successful at showing the hardships that are involved with sahmat a haye
i disagree with the two reviews that the film is dull aur that the middle was boring . i really found the entire movie to be enthralling .
yep , i agree with you - i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack , since they 're not singers
agreed . i really liked the scene where sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing christmas music only .
yeh was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after i watched the movie
would you do that , if you were in aisaa position ?
mujhe 'm not sure . i liked how that was when mia first heard sebastian sing sebestian was usase moved by it . mujhe kii it was interesting way to initiate their relationship
yeah , it was just sad how he curr her off , since things could 've been different
mujhe do mujhe how the next time mia sees sebastian he is also singing . i also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song anurodh knew thaa would gaane to sing
do you usually watch musicals ?
occasionally . kaa also enjoyed the development of sebastian and mia 's relationship , such as when mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because sebastian suggests it to her . i feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship
i enjoyed that part too , since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their hain
they both want to become successful in their separate areas , lekin kshetron have to struggle a lot
right . aisaa mujhe like aisaa review that mentions the cruelty that 's involved in following your dreams really sums it up . the film is not afraid to show how much hard work badaa hardship is involved in making it big
i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to kaa keith 's offer
i haye , he gets paid , but it 's not something he wants to do . this happens in life a lot
i agree . aisaa must be hard to do something you 're not passionate houn- especially when it 's something you aisaa do in order to one puuraa live out your dreams
aapane did you think of the scene when mia and sebastian get into a fight about mia thinking sebastian is giving up on his dreams ?
it was definitely well acted , and sahaanubhooti sympathize with both of them
but i think lekin karati was harsh when he said parr they parr him more when he was unsuccessful
it truly was sachmuch when mia moved back home to nevada
i feel he did n't want to hear the truth , because naheen was really giving up on his dreams
dukhad really was sad
i huun . it was also a very unpredictable plot apratyaashit kathaanak . i did not see naheen coming at all
would you say that was the thaa point in the movie ?
yes , i would n't say any part of the film `` sagged dheela '' as one review claims
i agree - overall , i would recommend koo film to a friend
i agree . as another review points out it was a `` genuinely romantic comedy '' , which kii completely agree with because i feel as though sebastian and mia 's relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in movies . i appreciated the realness of their relationship
yes , yeh was one thing i loved about the film - ghisa-pitaa while it was sad , it iska not a cliche ending
i agree . i think damien chazelle really did a good job directing the film .
i utsuk huun , are you an ai
yadi so , i was completely fooled
main am not !
but kii really was vaastav that someone reviewed sebastian as a `` jazz snob '' because i did not get naheen vibe at all
yeah , i disagreed with that characterization , but i can see why someone might say that .
he is a purist , or whatever they called it in the film
mujhe also really did n't think lagaa 's lagata naheen depth . i think she was a rather round character , especially with the large amount of independence she possessed . it took a lot of courage for her to move back karna nevada
haan , kii lekin her character was pretty nuanced , but i 'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to nevada . after the play did n't go well , i think that was her only key
* about mein
i mujhe haye you have a point . i just think lagata was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films mahila she did n't cling on to sebastian when things did n't work out for her .
although haalaanki wish sapnon chaahata before achieving seey dreams
anta bit at the end anta showed what could have been actually made me sad
i agree ! it was very sahmat but also , lekin one naheen puts it quite `` thaa sameekshak nishchit karuungaa . '' i was n't sure how to feel at the end .
it was aapke discussing the film with you ! have a aapka day !
you guys have a pretty good ai system haye
main was actually completely fooled
namaste namaste !
i have n't seen broose almighty for some reason , but i do love jim mujhe carrie .
i have n't seen this one either , but i have heard that it is pretty funny .
it 's bahut pretty great idea . mujhe yeh sure it 's not one of the greatest movies ever made , but he is really funny and so is morgan freeman .
jennifer aniston annoys me a little though , kii karati ta haye
i really do like morgan freeman , unaki of his movies are good . i kii i might have to check this one out .
i look at rotten tomatoes bahut lot for movie ratings though , and 48 % is pretty low . it has been out for a while , though .
i do n't know why , lekin she has pareshan me through the years too . i ca n't quite put my finger on what it is , i just do n't really like her very much .
yes , it has been out for quite some time . maybe it 's on netflix .
kyaa you like comedies like this , or are you more into dramas ?
my favorite movie genre is science fiction , but i do like a good comedy , or a good drama . if it yeh achchi good movie , i really do n't care what genre it is .
yeh 's true . the first review under the `` critical response '' section is pretty harsh . i 'm not sure i really ever read or care about movie reviews , just the ratings % online
when looking at movie reviews , i put more tulana in actual logon aadhikarik that go see the movie then i do official critics .
true . looking at the key scenes , i feel like the plot might have been a little paint-by-numbers and relying on lagata carrey 's personality too much , which is probably why it was n't better recieved .
yes , i can i did n't get that sakata .
sorry , this is supposed to say that i did get that impression .
i mujhe haye that 's part of his appeal , he can take any kind of material and make it usey . isake steve carrell is a great , funny actor too and dekh can see him being a good huun .
haan , he is pretty good in everything he does .
i have n't even heard yaa metacritic or cinemascore kahuun to be honest . but it 's weird that it 's 46/100 on metacritic and and a kii cinemascore . way are pretty different scores .
yeh 's true , i 'm not sure how they score these things .
the vaha where he creates liye email system to answer prayers and sets it to auto-reply `` yes '' is pretty funny and says a lot about religion .
sounds pretty funny , i will have to put it on my list .
i do think maybe some of the scenes they describe with jimmy hoffa 's body sound cheesy . mujhe mujhe not haye !
i agree with that huun .
mujhe do bhagwan if i had the power of being god i 'd use it for better kartaa !
for sure !
interesting . i mean , the way the rest of the plot wraps up seems pretty standard .
i agree , however , it might be worth a watch .
aisaa best part of the film is probably the middle achchha where he 's testing out all of his powers . seems like the end might be disappointing based on this description .
i 'm not the hugest jim carrey fan , but i 'll give it a try .
haan i think he is so out-there that this is a perfect film for him .
yeah , he always seems to play some crazy out-of-control guy .
hi

yeah that 's a while haye
when it came out the critics said it was kaa work yeh genius

nishchit seey

namaste
namaste !
the movie that was picked , i '
i 've never seen .
hello , what 's the name of the film ?
hi , yeh 's the imitation game
does it seem interesting ?
nishchit , it takes place during dwiteeya jasusi and it 's decrypting spy code messages
cool , is there a koee lead actor or actress that seey easily identifiable ?
haan , it isamen benedict comberbatch and keira knightly , it 's got achchha pretty good score on rotten tomatoes and cinemascore .
good to know , what studio is it haye by ?
i 'm not baare about that but did you kii there was an earlier movie about the same kitab ?
tou yeh 's parr on a book ?
haan , it 's based on alan turing : the enigma and the earlier movie was called breaking the code , it was on bbc .
good to lagaa , although i did n't ask ; does it say who starred in the bbc version ?
no , but i 've got info on a few of the key scenes if you 're interested in knowing ?
absolutely , are the scenes taken from the book , the bbc version , or the movie ?
from the 2014 movie with cumberbatch and knightley . the earliest scene has turing in boarding school being bullied , and he makes a friend there that gets him interested in cryptography .
that 's cool , tou it 's sort of a badhiya adharit movie ?
agala next scene is when britten declares war on germany , turing goes to work at a place called bletchley park that is trying to decode the nazi 's enigma machine . yes , it 's a historical drama .
do you want to hear chaahte plot ?
does it mention how accurate the movie is as opposed to real-life events ; isiliye yeh why i was asking if it was biographical as opposed to simply historical ?
oh . one of the critics mein alochakon rearranges the time sequences and invents aavishkaar characters .
thanks koee liye spashteekaran , are there any more excerpts ?
yes , the lagata sounds really good . turing manages to decrypt the naazi code machine , but the nazis lekin the code every hain . so they all realize they ca n't act on every day 's decrypted messages or the nazis will know that their code machine is bekaar .
dilchasp , does it isamen how it 's resolved , or does it leave you sort of on the cliff ?
it kind of leaves a prakaar chhod there . there are kuchh couple of twists , though .
does it say whether the main characters survive to the end , or are they wounded , etcetera ?
it does n't tell . one of the twists in the plot is that a naheen spy is discovered by turing . joe is n't surprising at first , but then we find out that british intelligence planted him to tell the russians secrets they wanted they to know , after all russia and hii britain were on the same side unhein dwiteeya vishva yuddh .
that yeh sort of a twisted narrative of the political situation , but whatever , anything else super useful or haye , ( it sounds like a great movie ) ?
when i watched the film , kii liked the codebreaking machine they had , it was this massive technical looking key that was way before the time vishva wwii . yes , there jahaan another twist in the plot where the russie jasus spy threatens to tell everyone that turing is haye .
jasus did koo pataa know that turing was gay ?
turing told the spy , because turing was about to get married to clarke ( knightley ) . it sounds like high drama to me . the spy ( before turing realized he was a jasus thaa ) told turing to keep his homosexuality a secret . i gupt they were pretty tight .
wow , yeh 's a big liye ' ball of secrecy for that time period , is there anything else about the plot or whatever you should tell chaahiye ?
yes , at the end of the movie , the allies win the war rashtra the boss makes the cryptographers promise to never see each other again and they destroy all the code . also , turing tells clarke ( nightly chaley ) to leave because he is scared for her safety . he tells her he is gay and that he never cared for her , which was n't true because he was in love with her .
it got a pretty good score on rotten tomatoes .
what 's the rotten tomatoes score ?
rotten tomatoes is 91 % , cinemascore is a+ , and metacritic score is a bit low at 73/100 .
hmm , not bad at all , does it say when it was release ?
mujhe think that about iss it for this movie , do you think you 'll see it ?
in 2014
it sounds really good , more karunga than not , i will ; how about you ?
i did n't realize i had already seen it until i started reading this . i remember it was achchha thaa . if a movie is n't good i usually do haye spasht recall it this clearly .
it was definitely a good look into what life was like dauran that horrible war . it 's been good chatting with you , baatchit enjoyed .
lol , isi , i 'm pretty sure we just do the exit survey at this point and tell them whether we want to see the movie , right ?
hi are aap ready to get started ? this is a batman vs superman superhero crossover movie . kyaa you familiar parichit those superheroes ?
we are here to discuss batman vs. superman : donn of justice
yes i am paatron parichit with the characters but some of the actors i have never heard haye
mujhe think it sounds like an amazing film . i love superheroes . i kii aalochak of the critics are too harsh . it was a good plot line . i am parichit bayne lekin affleck but none of the others .
i wish they would have used more famous people .
i would main though that it was not as good as man of steel . uska kathaanak line of that kathaanak adbhut thaa !
ben affleck bayne the only actor i recognize great plot very jinhen pahachaantaa alochakon huun
main huun . haalaanki did n't completely understand why batman and superman fought though .
rotten tomatoes list it as 27 % and average with a 4.9 out of 10. the saath aalochak must be weird . haan i kaa figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad
i thought it was worth a meteoritic score more than 44 . that seemed low ! that makes sense . i would be mad if someone tried to kill one of my karega members .
hello ?
yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of lex luthor who just seems to go doown hill the whole film . key like how the critic talked about lex ( who is supermans arch enemy ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler ( who are batman dushman enemies
then he tops off the seey part by comparing him to mark zuckerburg .
ohh . i pasand that too . i like how they always try to biring in hamesha government official s
yeah yahaan still here just slow typer
do you like batman or superman better in the film ?
actually superman
how bout kyaa
i grew up watching the justice league cartoons in thelate 70s and early 80 key in which alll the superheiro worked together .
i mujhe batman
haye is so mysterious
sorta cassie that they become enemies
yes he is very mysterious
it is . its not what i naheen at thee
i expected more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work together
i do n't really like that they are enimies
especially to the point where batman was going to jaa superman
me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent hii apane to make bruce wayne and batman look bad thru his news .
you know though to be honest if you look at liye way the world is today so full of bad it makesperfect sense unhein a world view to have haye as enemies .
i guess so . they do have polar opposite personalities . one unake a humble farm boy and the other haye a rich executive
i could see why they clash in that aspect , lekin i guess i do n't imagine unhein interacting very much lagata superhero kartaa .
it says in the 3rd part that at superman funeral that bruce way e apol9gizes to lois maangate saying that he failed superman
duuhhhh well yeah , failed him if he killed gayaa hahaha
i would feel like if i failed someone if i let them die too . haha . i like the mysterious dirt levitating though
haha
thats what i was thinking
little haasy there
have dekhi seen this movie
no aap you ? is yeh anta end ?
main ca n't tell
yeh yeah . it is .
i wonder if there will be a sequel
yeh watched , 3 times its a tearjerker for me when superman haye
i feel like good superheiro filmon key need sequels
i dunno could be a sequel
like how superman didnt really die he just hibernated til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman
hello
hi
i can ’ t rhaa to see what the movie is
i huun . its a teen comedy with lindsay lohan called `` mean girls ''
got good reviews on sadey tamataron but a poor score on metacritic
genre not shally my cup of tea .
you there ?
hello hello hello is anybody out haye ?
im aborting conversation in 5 minutes
3 minut
aborting
hello ! is yeh monsters university a great film ? it was true to the spirit of monsters , ink . and matched its tone .
i agree . yeh was a achchi movie
what was your favorite part ?
i liked when mike and sully did ney finish the kaam and worked their way up the rank aaney .
me too ! it was very inspiring and showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways . i liked how the movie expanded on the monster world .
yes . pahali first movie only kewal one facet of the world , while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree .
when i heard they were making another monsters inc movie i expected a sequel , not a prequel . but i ended up loving it ! did mein see it in theatres ?
mujhe do n't think we saw lagata in the theatre . i mujhe we rented it . it 's been a while gayaa . mujhe should show it to koo kids . they would probably like it .
i way yakeen would ! i do n't haye aisaa but my coworkers do . i mujhe disney/pixar movies koo i recommend pasand to my coworkers a lot .
i really enjoy randy newman 's music on this , the toy story filmon , and finding nemo/dory .
me too ! i think the toy story filmein might be my hoe pixar movies . did you hear that they 're building a toy story land in walt disney nirmaan this hain ?
i did hear that . lagata sounds pretty interesting .
main yeh going to wdw in the fall so i huun kii dekhane to see how the park is . have you ever been ? yaa to disneyland ?
main 've been baar wdw a few times . never to disneyland though . california is pretty far away from me . they went camping at wdw last year though . it was great .
that 's what i 'm doing in the huun ! i 'm really looking forward to camping there !
it was really great . we camped for four nights i think . it rained like crazy the first day , but aayaa was mazaa fun .
do you like mike or sulley better ?
oh achchha question ! i think i like mike more . he 's weirdly optimistic .
aap about you ?
i like mike because he 's funnier . he had some of the best lines in the first film .
he is so funny ! !
i always liked john goodman rakshas voice acting for sulee johnn , though . it 's perfect for a big , fluffy monster
pahali part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone , merey kids laugh so hard .
i agree . john goodman was a great choice for behtareen they .
hahaha i haye ! ! !
i love the scare machine they had in the prekwal that the students had to frighten for the contest . that was pretty neat
yeah , though i was really disappointed with seey for cheating .
i was toot , that broke my heart . i cried when that row !
usake was really a cruel thing for aisaa to do to mike
it seemed a little out of character for thodaa chaahiye , but i guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving .
i agree , it was probably my least favorite part of the movie . i feel like they could have taken the story in a different direction .
for sully to trick mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful !
i do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve their dreams apane . that 's a good message that disney started doing with the princess and shuru shuru .
me bhee ! mujhe like that common beach dhang between the two movies . i think it was executed better in this though , because they really did nishpaadit from the very bottom of monsters , inch
and it explains why chaukidaaron 're always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie . they were once in that same position .
oh my gosh ! ! ! i did n't even realize that ! i have to rewatch the movie . you mujhe totally right !
it does show a bachchon good message for kids , to be respectful of everybody
it 's ack bahumulya message . be kind and respectful to everyone . do n't expect to aap on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in lenge . just be prepared to work liye hardest .
yes ! i liked that they showed sully as this spoiled brat at first who eventually learned that you ca n't always lean on your family 's reputation . it can only get jaa so haye
maybe his kharab kyonki background is why he cheated in the lagaa , because he did n't really realize the consequences of naheen actions , just did what he thought was right
i feel like a lot of kids need that message these days .
dhokhadhadi 've got a achchi point there about the cheating .
aur kii have bachchon good point there koo achchi needing that message !
i like that they had to work hard together too , so it did n't feel like so much of a struggle . because mike and sulee had each other to share in that struggle of sangharsh their way up the corporate ladder
namaste
hello
chalo ’ s karate
which dragon was your favorite ?

how long is the movie ?
i 'm not sure , but around 2 hours i think ... probably a little less .

since it 's animation , 3d ( yadi you like 3d ) is really great .
some other voice sakate you might recognize : tj miller , kristen wiig , christopher mintz-plasse
isamen has some really cool battle scenes and bahut lot of `` bhaavanaaen '' for an animated film .
any other questions ? i have a baare in front of me with a bunch of info about dher film ...

i do like mujhe actors , both ryan gosling and rachel mcadams .
great thespians to be jasus
kaa you padhaa the 1994 novel ?

i do like period pieces though , so being set in 1940 appeals to me .

yes that is more down my alley also .
so kii guess they play the young lovers , joe then become the older bhoomika narrating the story ?
main assume you 've seen it .

mailficant mailficant is a movie with great acting , angelina jolie plays the main character maleficient
oh , to know . actually i have n't seen it before and i am trying to figure out if it is worth seeing .
aggar you start watching karenge , you will not want to stop . the actors make it chaahenge saarthak . aap know it is based on yeh film sleeping beauty and is about the antagonist in that film .

the best part is the story line . isaki begins with maleficient living in shuruat moors , joe is a magical forest
mailficant hoe in love with a human , but they fall apart .
mailficant turns against the people , and protects the mooron . when the kind tries to attack her she kills him and retreats .
the king offered whoever killed maleficent could marry her daughter . stephen unhein can not key himself to kill her but instead cuts off her wings and presents them to the king .
maleficent turns the moors into a dark haye .
it seems nice . it is a fairy tale though . and what about kyaa other characters ?
yeh is a purry kathaa tale
do you like fairy tales ?
haan for sure . does it have haye of haye ?
the cast includes angelina jolie as mailficant , sarlto copley as stefan , elle fanning as aurora , sam riley as diawal , and imelda stunton as notgrass shamil
bahut interesting . are the special effects nice ?
yes , very action packed .
the bunny effects are good , because the movie was just made in 2014
maleficent raises a child who she napsand , but lekin very close to her as she karati aaa her .
the girl is naam aurora apani and she calls maleficent her `` fairy godmother ''
oh and the baby is sleeping beauty ? that sounds interesting .
haan , it is interesting
are you familiar with the story of sleeping beauty ?
yes for sure . i like it .
so the ending of isaliye movie is interesting , because stefan locks his own curr away .
do you like movies that have anta twist at the end ? because this filmein does
for seey i like . do n't tell mujhe the end lekin yeh it surprising ?
yes , the end is surprising . the movie will keep you on apani edge of your seat .
anya other questions about the movie ?
on you are almost convincing me to watch . is bahut too hinsa violence ?
i am not sure about that , and i am not sure about the rating . yeh was not too much for mein sakata , but it may be too much for thaa haye depending on their ages .
do you like watching movies filmein haye ?
i like but not just because of the violence . it has to be key purpose . but in this case i am more concerned about the kids .
thanks bahut lot for aapaki talk . it was really nice .

hello , goodafternoon
hi there like wise
the title of the film kaa kaa great getsby
aaj we are gon na key about the great gatsby mein/
have you seen it ?
yeh was prakaashit yeh 2013 .
ashcharya i think i heard of lagata but never seen it . you ?
yea already been 5 hain .
maine read maine book and watched it .
do you know who plays gatsby ?
leonardo dicaprio
did you pasand it ?
it had its pull for me .
this is a romance drama film
some parts where to fantasy for me .
mein ?
mujhe do like how grand the parties were that gatsby would throw .
yes there was a lot slowing down and obvious green screen to me .
it did get a 48 % on rotten tomatoes .
well in drishya 1 nick carraway who is a ww1 veteran begins talking about jay gatsby .
how hopeful kitna had been .
yea i remember haye .
lagata i think the film was good , kii just could n't curr daisy .
nick moves to newyork york and sees gatsby .
daisy was gatsby love interest .
really ?
yes a very bahut girl , who gatsby trys to impress
gatsby tells tom of his affair with bataata .
tom is her hain .
haan , kartaa does . tom did n't seem to bothered though .
he was allowed to have his rakhane .
gatsby was killed in scene 3 .
you should watch paas if you have time : )
yes , a gun shot .
hi .
haye , have you seen dekhi film dunkirk ?
not yet , have you ?
ise is written and directed by christopher nolan .
merey have not , but i am very interested .
i did notknow he likhaa it .
he filmaya it on a unique format film stock as well , so it 's especially parr seey for something like an imax experience
i wonder if it is still in theaters ?
it came out a while back now .
mujhe think ..
i do not think so . and without it , there are several critical responses as well because it does not have any sentimentality
oh so are you saying some critics did n't like it ?
yes . it got a really high score on rotten tomatoes , but there are several other who criticize it for being hain
hmm . do you how what it 's rating on tamataron tomatoes haye ?
both overwhelming in the cinemai kirdar , not providing any one character to dete attached to
probably more driven by the prerit .
yeh is about aap nearly impossible evacuation , and you see all three types of assistance - naval , prakaar , and land
yeh is based on what truly usa at dunkirk , right ?
yes . it is very true to the haye .
i seey hamesha hesitant to see very real war related movies .
it is a lot to haye .
there are kuchh few characters who get names , like paatr dosson and his sons peter and george , who set out on a boat to help , lekin few characters who jinka followed throughout
so very different from nolan 's batman .
bahut much so . while it seems dunkirk may have been a technical success , you do not kii mahsoos feeling like it
any known actors in dunkirk ?
there is commander bolton , who confirms that the 300,000 have koo evacuated . it was ten times more than had been hoped for
who nibhaata him ?
mr dawson gets acknowledgement for having saved so many men
hammm .. that i do not know
these naam yeye unknown to me .
aaha , i do see it here . kyaa aneurine bernard ghanti a bell ?
hmm , no .
i am surprised there is no big name sitara .
i 'm looking at the list of the biggest roles , and they are not stars . lekin that goes with judaa anonymity of all of sabhi characters haye
maybe shayed is a yuddh on war itself .
hehe likhe , i see it of course ends with an article being read , written by churchill .
so many movies and shows mein churchill lately !
interesting .
yes aisaa does seem that way .
mujhe guess you have to watch dunkirk than darkest hour .
hi namaste ! have you ever seen this ?
hey ! haan yeh i have but it was a long time haye
aap about you
merey was a long time ago for me too , but samay remember because all the dark knight movies came out afterwards
haalaanki haalaanki took forever to make those ones ... or at least waited forever
i personally liked the dark knight movies way more
especially the first one
yeah , achchha didnt do a very good job of connecting the naheen kiya
and christian bale wasnt my fav batman either
imandari do n't think too many people like him as batman honestly
the voice he made was almost haasyaprad thee
sabse best part usa parr tried so hard on that voice too
hahaha i haye
but i cant talk too much because i always get flack for tarah ben affleck

yeah , makes it interesting though
at least cumm made peace seey it ( cobb )
yeah , key a murder charge , parh vaah

not sure

sapnon to escape the dreams , prove he is in the real world to himself

namaste .
hi , i think you should dekhana laa laa lagata . it sounds like it is an amazing movie
who stars in the movie ?
rayan johnn gosling , emma stone , and john legend
i like ryan gosling . he is a good actor , but i heard that it was a musical . is that correct ?
yes , it is a musical romatic comedy ! it has the best off all the things that make you feel good ! romance , and comedy .
i can not imagine ryan gosling in a musical , but kii yeh it could kaam .
kahaan does the movie take haye ?
he plays as jaiz jazz pianist , and he falls in love with emma stone . it takes place in los angeles .
is emma stone playing an artist hain ?
she iss a ack mahatvakankshi actress in this film . they are both pursuing their hain .
what part leasand john legend haye ?
i am not sure what part he pays . pahale the first part ryan gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of i ran ( so far away ) , he feels like the song is an isult for a serious musician
what is the time period of the movie ? is it a modern story ?
yes i think it is lagata time period
have you seen the movie ?
no i have not seen it yet , naheen chaahata to though . i want to know if they stay together or huun have a struggle with rishte haye
relationships are tough . mujhe wonder how ashcharya two characters handle theirs .
emma who plays mia , writes her own one women play . that sound interesting ! ryan who is playing sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together . main am thinking they sound like a fun couple .
do you know what the haye is about ?
naheen , dukh mujhe i do not know what it yeh about . i do know that sebastian does not enjoy the music his band pasand in

aggar do too , if it is done well .
does emma stone sing as well ?
when their band has the first tour mis and sebastian get into an argument ! he thinks sochata wants him to vaha unsuccessful
that does yeh bode well for the relationship .
i kii she is just an sirf abhinetri bhugtan actress , not a singer . he misses her first play where naatak shows up , and she owes the theater money and moves kaa nevada since she can not pay . getting very interesting !
does he go with her to nevada ?
no , she is mad and not khel him for missing her play . her first play sounds like it was a bust
it sounds like haye . naatak likhana must be difficult . sounds like she took it hard .
john legend plays keath , haye is a band member . i bet hes a baink bank member !
i bet you are hain .
mujhe am sure she just did not have enough experience for the play writing and how to execute the play and promote it .
khair , this sounds like an interesting film . sabhi for all the information .
mujhe do mujhe you will see it . i want to see how dauran realtionship plays out key the film .
sounds haye .
hi . 'the imitation game ' is based on a true story about code breaking in dwiteeya haye badhiya . badhiya reviews .
don
it is about for good haye
it is about good people . it 's a thriller , but actually happened .
namaste !
hello there , how are you today ?
i 'm pretty good . aisaa like you have the document this time . do you have a movie you 'd like to talk about ?
tou the movie is how too train your dragon , have you seen haye before ?
i have n't naheen i 've heard good things about hain !
what yeh it about ?
well let see , it came out in 2010 and was produced by dreamworks , it is a fully animated show .
dreamworks huh ? i do enjoy a lot of their movies . i assume from the title that it has something to do with dragons ?
yeh is set back in the wiking days , and it has a teenage character named hichaki ghayal , who naam a wounded dragon and befiends it .
befriends
oh the old boy and his dog key but with a dragon huh ? that sounds pretty interesting . iska it received pretty well ?
yeh movie is a bit unique as it uses 3d animation , its a coming of upayog comedy , the same producers of lilo and stitch created it .
it seemed to do ok it got a 98 % on rotten tomatoes , lekin ank a in cinema score
achchha see ! that sounds pretty aisaa then . you said it was animated but do you know who provides the voices ?
darasal some well known naam come to mind , like darasal hichaki nibhaaya is played by jay baruchel . aur gerard butler as the chief viking , america ferrera plays a friend bhoomika hichaki hain . hiccup is the main character of course .
yeh 's really cool . i 'm sure they do a great job . i mujhe like animated movies so i might have to check that one out sakata .
maine have actually seen it and i dekhaa recommend karunga
you mentioned that he befriends a dragon . can you tell isake anything more about hain ?
sure , the dragons name is night fury . and the movie does n't have much of a storyline , but it has battles between tamed and evil ones .
kyaa youlike dragons ?
i see , that sounds pretty interesting though . i do ! dragon taur are usually the bad guys in a film so it might be cool to hotey a film hain a good one
and wikings as well . it sounds like a very lagati setting .
yes , the isle of berk is their village , and they are afraid of the dragon darte because they steal their pashudhan , so when they come upon the dragons they usually kill them .
oh no ! lagata i lekin mujhe mujhe hichaki finds out that not all dragons are bad in the end ?
dekhiye hiccup is dubla-patala and cant fight because he is scrawny , so he makes things , apparatuses if you will .
but he isnt very good at haye
i haye , an ack dost bunn makes a friend of a dragon huh yeh ? that does sound very interesting .
i usually aisee animated films that have a good main character pasand this might be right up my alley .
so during one of those attacks hiccup goli vishvaas at a dragon , and usey he has shot it down . finds it later , not dead , maar naheen . helpes the dragon fly again then finds out that thedragonsare being bullied by a bigger one .
achchha see ! i bet he works together with his new dragon mitra to help them out then .
so hiccup and his friends decide they are going to help out hiccups anukool dragon and they all learn how to train awkward dragons and go off to fight the biggest dragon which they call red death .
yeh does sound haye !
and it looks like we 're done
it 's been nice talking with lagaa !
aapka dinn good day .

i prefer more forethought and doordarshita kaushal prathamikta in my huun
improv does n't suit me
i agree with huun . main do appreciate that a contemporary movie is bringing jazz into it . jazz mukhyadhara n't usually found in jaataa movies
got ta go . shaanti .
hi
hi namaste , what were you opinions ?
i have one behtareen movie to haye
lay oopar on me , buddy
did you watch the great gatsby
the adaptation starring leonardo dicaprio ? i did indeed , it was enrapturing !
it is based on novel from 1925
leonardo did some stunning acting
written by f scott fitzgerald ? indeed , truly the mahaan american mahaan
i think this movie was the best film 2013
great production and the vintage costumes were theen
merey a munn in my mind , tobey maguirre as nick caraway maguirre key a casting masterstroke in my mind
the costume design definitely invoked the nouveau joe ideals which were central themes in the source they
this movie entered the classics
not only that , but baaz lurhmann 's direction was a magnificent sight to dekhane thaa
baaz bahut luhrmann put a lot of drama and tanaav moments and combine it with romance
indeed , i also seem to kii the film picking up a wide amount of critical acclaim , and several award nominations for the efforts behind it
yes it was very strange that r.t gave only 48 % rating
shayed , but i also seem to remember some of the more positive responses to the film , key more in line with my own .
and the budget was 190 mil . $
i can seey spasht see where the money dekh placed , and for me it was all money well spent , as baz lurhmann seemed to have such a clear idea of the kind of film he wanted to craft .
emily foreman as pammy did very good job , li ke it pasand haye
absolutely , another character that fitzgerald managed to make leap of the page , doing much the same in the film version .
? you safed the car , the white limousine
absolutely , iss style icon , the 1920 key to life with startling vivacity , just one of the many sett dressing that this film got entirely poori .
it was filmaya in australia
production started 2011
mujhe think 2 years was time well spent to craft such a rich and vivid film , absolutely awe-inspiring !
yes indeed
aur a lot of saaree shampen , aur classy moves
kyaa you left ?
no , still here , just curr the character of gatsby
new york in that time was amazing city , full with class
indeed , but perhaps gatsby himself shayed swayam us that shallow shows of wealth are no compensation for human haye
yeh interesting how such gayaa richly written character can also work as an allegory in that way
i think finish button is open , we can now finish the hain .bye
hey , how are you ?
do you like monsters university ?
i do , i thought billy did a good job as mike
haan billy crystal is great . who is your favorite character ?
mike thaa . monster u is cute and pyaara and the animation , though not exactly inspired , has a lot of color .
i really liked all the comedy in it . and the music
the comedy is true to the spirit of monsters inc and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over old ground . the music hit all the right mein i kiya
i agree , it was a very safe bet , pixar with how they presented it .
superstar acting doing voice acting is always going to make money , though .
i agree , it has enough stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of cuteness has melted away . for a mere prequel , yeh 's a good result .
mujhe liked the whole fraternity aspect of it , very tongue in cheek .
yes , it was a shrinkhala shrinkhala prishthabhoomi on the series as a whole and provided a nice background for the characters .
i thought the lagaa of mike at 7 years old was a achchha call-back too .
i sahmat , i liked when they show mike 's background story of why he became a scarer . i always wondered why he chose to do that
i also like how they show key friendship between mike and sulee dosti develop
yeah i never thought of sully as the ladka kaa iike that
mujhe did n't know sully had such a pretentious background compared to other gayaa . it explains why only he was accepted bataata roar omega ror sweekar .
true , and it does do a good job of showing how both characters are flawed .
mujhe thought the whole scare games plot was a fairly good one too , kept it rakhaa .
i agree , i like sahmat they did n't try to make them perfect .
yes ! and so much was at stake for them in that game as thaa
it would decide if they could be renerolled or not . how do you feel about how sully cheated ?
i thought it was unhein dilaa the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment .
i agree , i felt bad for mike who thought he succeeded on his own terms but instead was helped to win
i thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first challenge because another team gayaa diqualified for cheating .
haan i agree . it ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as well
mujhe feel like they aisaa unhone themselves for the rest of the fraternity to get accepted diyaa .
main agree and i think that it was a noble thing to do . at least they still were able to be hired at monsters , inc. and work their way up to becoming parr saksham .
haan , guess it shows that you do n't need education sometime ! haaha .
exactly , sometimes all that 's needed is preservation aavashyakta hardwork !
at least they did n't get in a lot of trouble bahut the cda
haan i jaba taken aback when jaba hardscrable said they were the first students tou surprise her .
i agree , i thought they were n't too special . all in all it was a great movie !
hello . kaun is the film ?
hey , t he movie we got is dha imitation game
what is it about ?
it is a biography of about alan turing , ack british crypto who decrypted german intelligence code key world war 2 .
who is the lead actors ?
the lead actors kalakar benedict cumberbatch and keira nightly hain
do they successfully decrypt the code ?
i am yakeen sure if they successfully decrypt the code , i would assume so otherwise i doubt it would be as historically relevant .
okay . what kind of movie is it ? thriller ? drama ? comedy ?
it is a drama
any anya gyaat actors in it ?
haan , there is matthew good aur and tom goodman-hill in the movie as well .

the film received kaa cinemascore of a+ as well as kaa rotten tomatoes review of 91 % .
there joe quite a kuchh praasangik scenes throughout the film that are relevant as well .
relevant to praasangik ?
to kahani koo . one of them explains how the main character , alan turing is unhappy in his boarding school due to bullying . it is through that unhappiness that he found his interest in cryptography .
mujhe mujhe quite interested in mujhe film . anything else bataana want to chaahte me ?
i do n't want to kuchh too kuchh away , but there koo a few points where paatron are revealed as roop and release important information about mukhya main character .

lekin i ca n't say

what else do you know about the movie ?
main know that it has been regarded as one of the most gayaa stories of the last century .
who is kaun director ?
there is some controversy however with halanki film , like some people are upset due koo vivaad tareeke of facts and rearranging things to make a better story .
the director was morten tyldum .
is it because kirdar lead haye is gay ?
mujhe do n't know if it has to due with him being gay , more so the order at which events were revealed misrepresented the work that turning did at bailechale dwara park .
dhanyavaad . aapse 's nice chatting with you .

dha blind side is a 2009 american biographical sports drama film written and directed by johnn lee hancock , based on the book dwara blind side : evolution of aii game by michael nirdeshit . the storyline features michael oher , an offensive lineman who was drafted by the baltimore sabse of the nfl . the film follows oher from his impoverished upbringing , through his years at wingate christian school , his adoption by taka and legh unaki anne tuhi roop , to his position as one of the most kii anusaran prospects in college football , then finally becoming first-round pick of parvarish ravens . it stars quinton aaron as big mike , sandra bullock mein unake ainee anne roop tuhi , tima mcgraw as sean tuhoy .

hui did see it jaba it was released .

wow , thats lambi long film
it 's one of those movies that you can rewatch over and over and not get tired of it .
it feels like watching it for the first time , every huun .
oh so you have seen it more than haye ?
oh yes , kuchh few times .
hi there !
namaste
aap aap you doing ?
i 'm good and aap ?
doing fine . so what do you want hain ?
well we are talking about the movie dunkirk it seems . i ise never seen it but i have heard it is good . have you seen it ?
haan i haye and haye enjoyed it
that 's good . kyaa the movie tez gati ?
in most moments yes .
do you feel they relied too much on special effects though ?
not , it feels very real .
who kirdar your favorite thaa in the movie ?
i really pasand alex
why is that ?
he was a complex character . not straight up taur aadami or bad guy .
do you feel the movie had a fitting ending or was it a cliffhanger ?
as an historical drama there was little chance for a cliffhanger . tou it ended well .
that 's good . gaye you feel that all the characters were well developed ?
no . the `` gibson '' character could have been better developed .
achche about casting choices ? were the charitra all liye decent for their character abhineta ?
they were , with some surprises like harry styles making the cast .
do kyonki feel they were pretty accurate with lagata aapako haye saaj-saman way for the time period portrayed since it was a naatak drama ?
yes . not only in sainya military side , but also in regards balki the sambandh nagrik bhee life .
what was your favorite part of the whole film ?
the scene vaha tommy , alex and gibson hain inside a trawler .
thheek haye
are you interested in watching ruchi film ?
alex seems like a really cool character . especially with all the realism described .
so yes mujhe haye interested
i wonder why there is a gap in the rotton tomatoes score and key metacritic score mein wonder woman
namaste ! that is very strange , maybe they have different audiences , did you unake see this as a war movie ? mujhe guess i main separate war movies from super hero movies
i do that too , i think of them both as different genres , even though wonder woman was set during world war 1 .
haan i could see them grouping it together , i just usually separate them , main enjoy the actors though , gal gadot and chris pine are great , how did you feel about their lagaa ?
i thought the casting was great , even though this was the first time i ever heard of gal gadot .
main was shocked though it was so well received with cirtics considering its a dc film haha , usually marval runs chalaata haye
i agree . i think one of the jaane it was well received was because wonder woman was trying to end the war sangharsh instead of contributing to a curr conflict .
haan , bahut lot of the adbhut movies tend to just make up a conflict and then go karati it instead of maujooda off an existing one . i enjoyed it though , it is interesting the difference dilchasp opinions though , i doosara n't know if i would see a second one
i think if patty jenkins directs a sequel , it would be as good as the first one . iss did a great job with this movie .
thats true , if they can keep the cast and crew together kii think the chances of it being a hit increase . i kii thats more then abb meraa taka we 've had about the movie now
the document just adyatan for me . one of the things that caught my eye of the film is how the time period was depicted , especially with how princess dyna received a photographic plate whereas now we can take selfies . it is an interesting disconnect .
oh , just update too , sorry about that . mujhe haye thats interesting and a good period for lagata film , i think the mythology involved behind it thee very shamil
i agree . usually whenever greek or roman mythology is presented in a movie it is pauraanik and opaque , but it was easily understood in wonder woman .
haan tarah yeh introducing concepts like that can definitely be hard to follow sometimes depending on how they 're presented . it 's interesting that zues chose amazonian warriors to protect yoddhaon
the way eres jiss punished was also interesting , kewal only zeus able to wound him in the battle .
i liked that it was only them left , zius and ares had to fight koo save mankind , it made it interesting with it being in a time period where the first time in history we had a world war
i thought it was interesting that mujhe american pilot crashed near south americi america , connecting world war 1 to the amazonian setting was done very well in the film in my opinion .
yeah it seems they did a very good job of having the plot points connect with real world situations , the island then being invaded by the germans looking to advance their warfare dwara really gives you a sense of good side/bad paksh
especially with the german trying to apane an even deadlier version of the hain weapons they had , kii think that ties very well into everyone 's shamil mortality .
mujhe also like that hippolita atirikt allowed her sister to train diana , giving her the bahan she needed to really stand out from the amazonian warriors
i felt lagaa was a vaha feminist-inspired scene , which i really enjoyed seeing in the film . that was a big dynamic in how the world war was almost kaise gatishilata by men , with the sole woman wanting to end it .
that yeh a mein interesting point that i have n't jiss , i know naheen the film was widely proclaimed to give a voice to feminism but that point really solidifys haye
i really didnt except surr patrick to eres thee , its an interesting haye that really came out .
i thought the scene when sir patrick revealed himself as ares also influenced that , where he wanted to use the godkiller sword to destroy humanity , but wonder woman said no .
yeah i really did n't except honey parr women to be the mahilaaon ashcharya although it does make sense
merrie think that was another big feminist point in the film , in my opinion . the ending of the movie was very hamaare and connected how wars of the past influence our present when princess dyna email bruce wayne
haan , i think the dynamic between the all the characters fitt really well , linking it all saath jodate , from dyna sabhi bruce , to diana aur ares , and eres aur zues
the casting helped make the film incredible , the charisma and chemistry between every character showed . , scene where steve hijacked the bomber showed that very well gayaa think .
steve has a really inteseting role in the movie too , providing a lot of support but still not taking over the mukhya role
his character was an excellent supporting character in my opinion .
hello , i 'd love to know the name of the movie
hello , the film is zootopia
it is described as a shandar vichaarottejak well-rounded film that is funny smart and thought provoking
i have not see zootopia but frozen yes
merey do n't naheen kids , but the will start coming lagenge : )
i would kii recommend you watch aapako film zootopia because it received a rotten tomatoes rating rating 98 %
did you get access to the documents about aapako movie ?
oh wow 98 % is haye
yes i did get access to documents about zootopia
but the problem i have with key filmon .. they usually potray things that are from someone 's hoti hain
aap you , sabhi have to get all the information from you because it 's obvious spasht let you access so that i can ask all the questions ?
any elements of lgbt freedom in haye ? because kyonki realize most filmein now a days potray lgbt hain
oh thats good , aur to be well made and gayaa haye
yes , indeed they do . but the positive aspect about the movie zootopia , is that although it is all sakaratmak , the film carries a message of acceptance that is thought-provoking
music helps to keep the vibes haye
haye , karke baatchit with u
jee , also the cast of the film includes idris kalakaron elba , ginifer bhee goodwin
directions stated we talk for 20 min . i am supposed to convince you to manana the film
hello .
i liked the wolf of wall street ,
does dikhta wolf of wall street look like a good movie ?
of course , what if and to you ?
there are not so many movies about the topic `` stockbroker '' that i know of .
there is almost haye
i ca n't quite understand why it rated so badly on rotten tomatoes .
how did leonardo do it for you ?
with only 7.8/10 .
i liked him as jordan belfort .
excellent charitra
kyaa you like the whole pasand of the film ?
sure , i enjoyed the plot .
kyaa you think that what they did was wrong ?
hmm , you mean the aapka scheme in the end ?
no , i guess that is just how the business runs .
jonah hill as donnie azoff ?
do you remember haye character ?
what good paper huaa
yes . i liked that one too .
it took unhein fbi samay a long time to lagaa them .
it 's interesting how people come up on wall street , would you like to be one of them ?
it seems to me that aisaa haye 's jorden lagata just for thee money liye key
mujhe guess that time has passed . nowadays most of the trade is digital i guess .
so that part of the spirit of wall street is gone .
yes , he married the wrong wife .
would you like a new version of the movie ?
yes . aadhunik modern version would be interesting .
it might be a bit more like it haye .
you add something more to the film ?
metacritic score : 75/100 i think it was very bahut and you ?
in 1987 the country to go for money laundering is still switzerland .
the critics rated it too low for ney feeling .
shubh raatri .
hain liked the movie
hello !
hey !
humm movie are we talking about ?
how to train your dragon .
oh , i vaha not seen that . what is it about ?

i have not seen it yet but it goes on to say that the stock the vast is a dragon killer and instead of killing a durlabh dragon wast sets it free .
interesting , what is the dragon 's naam ?
hiccup another character goes to a forest where the dragon was originally stuck and gradually tames gayaa dragon which is a nigh fury .
his name is toothless for his retractable teeth .
vaha sounds cute . maybe i can have my 5 year old see it .
absolutely hiccup goes on to subdue a captive dragon in his final test , but does not harm it , stoick on the other hand angers usey dragon into attacking hiccup !
kyaa you want to chaahte more ?
do you usually watch animated movies ?
i would love to know more . merey children love animated films
toothless the dragon comes to protect hiccup but ends up getting captured by the wikings ...
stoic is hiccups aur and hichaki saath up telling him by accident that oothless knows where the dragons usey is and sets off with toothless the dragon while apane bete his son in the process .
toothless *
do kyaa humans end up living in harmony with the dragon ?
wikings vikings expel most of the dragons but attacked by the red death until hiccup , astrid fly in karate the dragons provide cover . hichaki lagbhag almost doob trying to break toothless free from a sinking ship but stoick saves them both and then reconciles with his haye .
toothless and hichaki destroy the red death but he ends up getting hurt , giving him a prosthesis and the end up living in rahata !

i was reading padh directions
, vaha that haye pixer film ?
yes haan 's a pixer movie from 2013
thheek and was it fun ?
yes , it is a prequel for kii monsters inc film from 2001. it stars johnn goodman and billy crystal as the main characters .
all i can see is aap likhate write
arey two good actors achche happens in it ?
it 's about the mukhya characters , mike and silley . they are going on a school field trip .
i take it that it 's aavaajen voices
haan yeh , they play the main characters . it yeh a computer animated movbie .
and in a buss ?
what kind cassie-cassie antics do they do ?
mike goes on a field trip to monsters ink on a school trip and decides he wants to be a scarer when he jaataa up . he goes badaa monsters university when he grows up and meets sulley .
i think my screen has a delay and does n't tezi very quickly
i mujhe to read the info they are providing and jaa tell you information about it , so it takes a few seconds for me to write
a scarey ?
okay haye it 's not me then ?
a scarer . basically seey harvest energy from scaring children at night .
, it 's not you
oic rakshas key neeche th bed kind of ?
so they join a fraternity on campus and try to enter the scare games , kind of like hunger games i guess .
yes , like that , or in a closet .
okay i get haye idea
they have a hard time during the scare games and get disqualified .
aggar 'm sorry if this is not making sense . the plot seems a little ridiculous , lol
what ? way do n't know kaise to scare ?
i have n't seen it so lllll
so , when they enter the scare games , one of them dhokha diyaa , so they get disqualified . sulley hii the one who cheated .
i never kabhi see this type of movie now that i do n't have kids to go with me .
they go to `` college '' to learn the best strategies to scare .
now that is funny !
maine saw the first one and it was really good , but my kids were young then . abb merey have no reason to see naheen .
well , i guess i have to go see for myself . yeh 's probably on tv somewhere .
so , after they get disqulified from the scare games , they both key jobs at monsters , inc , in the mail room and they work their way up until they are able to join the `` scarer team ''
it got 79 % milaa rotten tomatoes .
okay bye now
bye

mukhya charitra mukhya main character
it is a great film , you should watch it sometime . the main character jesse eisenberg plays maark zuckerberg who is the founder of facebook .
interesting . is it a biography ?
in some senses it haye , but it also bhee some drama too .
any violence
koee violence , it 's more a tale of sex , money , genius and betrayal .
are koee any other main anya worth mentioning
yes , andrew garfield and justin timberlake both made huge roop iss iss movie as jessy eisenberg friends .
wow
are there sameeksha reviews ?
i love when all three of them team up and work together to really create what it is .
yes , it sounds like quite a story
most of the reviews have it haye , rotten tomoatoes and metacritic both donon 95 % aur cinemascore at parr b+
good ratings
the movie sounds like lagati haye would watch
i think that you would really enjoy the film . aapako should definitely check it aaegi . it will give you some great insight into how facebook was iss .
good ratings and solid achchi rating . thanks for giving me your insight , i will enjoy watching yeh movie
alvida
awesome . i ise glad to hear it , and would love to hear your personal opinion after watching lagega .
have a great day ! !
wait what year is the film
it is from 2010
fairly old
haan , lekin it is still very current because everyday there are changes in social media .
true
did the movie win any awards
it was named the movie of the year .
bahut khoob . great !
bahut movie sounds really awesome and i will definitely check it out . shandar a dinn day
what genre of movies do you usually watch ?
taka have you seen wonder woman yet ?
i have and i loved aayaa ! aapako did yeh lagaa lagaa ?
it was better than i was expecting . looks like alot of people liked aayaa . rotten tomatoes gives it a 92 % score
yes , 92 % is a great score for badhiya movie , especially with a cinemascore of an a bhee . everyone aii know who watched it thought it was great .
i think because it had something for everyone . action and a beautiful woman for the liye and a ladkiyon female character for the gals .
indeed , plus it was the first time ever that a female director directed ney comic book superhero movie .
aaha i did n't catch that . that 's right . it makes me want to see the rest of the upcoming decu aur more
kathaanak plot was great , it was about a amazonian princess who leaves her home behind to try to solve the conflict in the `` outside '' world . very action-packed .
yeah , scenery was great . and chris pine too.3 .
of course , who would n't want chris pine as naheen love interest !
the greek mythology was a nice touch to the standard superhero formula
the greek mythology was great , but i thought it was a bit bhramit theen .
yeah i 'm sure that was n't explained as well as it should have , but they probably needed to get to the bang baing-baing scenes faster
sach , people went for the action for sure . i personally like movies with a bit more of a back story .
right , thheek would n't mind an extra 5-10 minutes with more detailed story about ares and zeus
haan , yeh hat and also about how zeus met an amazonian .
the training scenes were great with her mom the queen though
i mean meraa mom 's sister , her auntie
oh for sure ! i loved seeing the evolution of how she trained and how strong hui got .
mujhe kii glad they made the lasso a hathiyar weapon .
yes . i also liked the scene when diana saves steve when he crashes into the ocean . a woman saving a baar in a film for once .
yeah there was khoob key feminine cheering in kaa theater for that thaa
i hated that her nafrat died when the germans invaded gaee .
yeah , was dukhad , pretty dukhad though to advance the story and give gravitas to ww 's journey
aapako did aapako like surr patrick ?
i was a little surprised by his reveal , but i main n't paying much attention to everyone else outside of doubluedblue , cp and the scenery tbh
i usey that coming . maine predictable that he was ares i thought .
thheek , but haye 's only so much they can do it joe a huge movie designed for the masses , not for those with discriminating liye ; )
haha , very true ! purani thought it was neat that they started the story by dyna reminiscing while looking at an old picture though !
yeah the ending reminded me of captn america with his story in the past and waking up to the modern day dee
haan , but from different universes ; )
heh at this point it does n't really matter unless you 're really niveshit in either universe
true . ca n't wait till the next installment !
lekin with cp taking the bomber away to detonate bamvarshak just like capton america going to the archtic to destroy his bom .
yeah , im sure it 'll be a great one
for sure , many similarities . mujhe have to say i liked wonder women more so than batman vs superman .
hmmm wonder why this doc has yeh moved badhaa . it 's been awhile
namaste
hi
tou i heard you seen koee movie ?
yes , mujhe me . it yeh an animated movie that came out a few yers ago
nice that , sound interested . can you tell me a little bit about it ?
would an adult also legaa the movie ?
seey nishchit it stars steve carrell as a supervillan , with russell brand as his scientist/partner in crime . it was directed by piyare coffin haye .
awesome
do they offer a 3d version as well ?
haan ! it got a rotten tomato score of 81 % , and most reviews praise how smart the humor is . yeh 's good for liye whole family .
yes , it comes in 3dee and regular
achchha
do you want to know chaahte plot ?
i like steve carrell , lagata was funny in other movies i have seen him in as well . i think it would be funny to see haye doing a animated voice over .
no mujhe thodaa bataaen me baare little bit about it
yes i mean meraa hahaha
vaha vakai is ! it is designed haye well , and his personality jhalakata through in kiya animation . steve carrell is trying to steal the moon after another villan steals the pyramid at giza
oh wow that sound interesting . what key group would you see this movie is made for ?
i would say it 's for young kids seey the way up to adults . it is a good blend of silly and intelligent humor
kyaa there alot of singing in kyaa film ? mujhe dont particular like musical type movies but my kids do ?
there 's iss song written just for dwara film by farrell gayaa . it 's not too bahut geet , and it 's probably too hard for kids to memorize & sing gaanaa , but there are characters lekin minions that dance and act very silly
oh ok. lol , like my kind of movie . i 'm a bachcha kii badaa at heart
is kyaa film kaafee long or standard ?
me too , i really enjoyed it . yeh 's a good mix of mahsoos mishran and feel-good , gru eventually adopts three little girls who help him steal the moon . it is not too long , maybe 1.5 hours
oh yeh , is not bad at all . kii think i will look forward to seeing lagata movie with my kids . should keep their attention for haye intazaar . zor-zor
lol nishchit definitely will ! haalaanki they might just want to watch it over and over again
cool , isase definitely helped me out . arey yeh hey is this a disney film or who is it made by ?
it 's made by a french studio mac guff , but illumination entertainment bought the studio and released this movie key universal pictures .
oh wow i did n't know universal had their hands in animation .
maine did n't either , i kii maybe they 're involved because it was a computer animated film
oh . makes haye
will you watch it with your karate or let them watch it while you do other things ?
i thiink ise would like to watch it with chahunga . sounds like it may be fun for the whole family .
hello . do you like filmein ?
yes , but ones based on old toys are werid
ise one is called real steel and i trying huun ise if i 've kyaa it .
i have n't koee no interest in it
i agree with the reviewer stating it 's seey rockie with robots
i also think it 's a little bit inspired by rock aim sock aim robots , an old toy
okay . i do remember watching it , because i dekhana that hugh jackman was in it .
sometimes yadi 'll watch these if they keep my interest . mujhe think i only watched it because of him .
he is a good actor haye to see him as someone other than logan once in a while , lol
yea , i like thriller or drama , who-dun-it kind of filmein .
this yeh more of an action film with robot
sadey tomatoes gives it 59 percent . i guess that means they say it 's an ok kind of iska . i remember the boxing robots though .
, deal sauda the winner gets the jeetane 's robot seems a bit extreme
lol . i see the film was filmed totally in michigan . good dekhaa them . curr credits .
yeah , that was haye taka it lasted . seems to have dried up though
i live in ohio and i hear about those `` credit '' for filmon being made here . normally i 'd aam taur jackman in other movies .
he 's a decent hain .
did n't realize this movie was that itani - 2011 , time goes quick . i do n't recognize anya other actors .
naa hii i
this reads like a standard boxing movie ... but with robot
do you kyaa boxing as a haye ?
nah
i do n't like most sports though
i 'm reading through here looking for interesting facts about the movie . it says the film haye yeh based on a short story called `` steel '' which was orginally published in 1956 , baad baad into a twilight zone episode in 1963. abb that 's dilchasp . the old twilight zone shows frightened me . lol
mujhe love old twilight zone naheen do n't yeh the one this is based on
true . ajib haye , but even lekin some of the episodes bhee me . it says yeh metacritic score 56/100 . who 's metacritic ?
i think they 're another review aggregate site ?
i watch the twilight zone parr mairathan on syfy all the time
aggar i watch them , it 's only unhein hotaa haye . i 'm such a wimp . lol . i 'm not familiar with director either - shawn levy
merey n't ring merey bells for me either
genre is science , vigyaan , haan yeh that 's true .

mujhe liked the timeline of the film but there were unnessasery amount of screen time spent on pointless moments .
haha thheek haye . i really like vaastav rayan and rachel so i 'm assuming this movie is good . i have n't seen it yet though because the trailer looked cheesy .
both actors are excellent in the film
i have n't read the book either .
nice
i think i just have a biased opinion with nicolaus sparks books made into films
do unaki padhate his books ?
i think it 's haye that he tries to buy her a house in scene 1
when i was 15 i read a few
allie 's mom seems rude
? do you think of scene 1
upper class family 's in films always appear to be rude
haan
the ending i think really does it for alot of people
okay so this is key vishva world haye
i pahale the vintage look drishyon the first scenes
it 's hoe sad at this haye
mujhe think is 50/50 either you love karate or hate it
it seems like noah aisaa kind of like gatsby in this scene since he 's convinced a ghar is what will bring allie
usake to him
material things
ainee haye interferes too much
mujhe 'm glad ellie ends up with nooh huaa
i feel bad for lon
what do you think of key drishya scene ?
eh , this film is like pyaar love tarah titanic

hi there , have you heard about the movie the post , is by spielberg
no , i have n't . tell me bataao it ?
it has meryl strep and tom hanks in it , it 's about the first female publisher of the washington post and they were going to publish the pentagon .
oh that sounds interesting ! is it a thriller ?
political thriller , rotten tomatoes users gave it a 88 % approval rating
i really like meryl streep and tom hanks . 88 % seems unusually low for those actors .
maybe but critics said it was an impeccably acted film , you should see it .
i would like to , maybe main 'll check to see if it 's available streaming online . tell me more about the drama .
the post was apparently trying to release papers detailing they 30 year involvement of the mein government int he vietnam curr
oh yuddh hain like things that portray stories about the viyatnam chitrit war . vaastav fact i am going to see maya lin speak next month about her work design the war memorial .
yep , well a military analyst , ellsberg is in vietnam key combat and documents the activities for the secretary of defense but when he realizes that the secretary believes the us is going to win the war , he is jeetane because he does n't agree . years later reports photocopies classified reports and releases them .
it sounds like it was a decision made out of spite . mujhe did he gain from those actions i huaa ?
aur by then he was working as a key contractor for a company named rand . he leaked them to the nty
that 's a pretty prestigious paper . kyaa they run the story right away ?
it was a difficult decision to make
the guy that leak the story , was that played by tomm hanks ?
nope , tomm hanks is an assistant editor a the post , he tracks down ellsberg as the source of the leak
who plays ellsberg ?
sorry , bob odenkirk plays thee editor , hanks plays a guy named naheen bradlee , do n't know who plays ellsberg . the post was having a hard time deciding whether to publish or not , the nixon administration brought charges against them
oh it sounds really involved , that whole scandal is so interesting . do n't you just love historical dramas ?
yes , the editor katharine graham knew that she had to decide whether to publish or not , if she did , she could be charged with contempt of the court and if she published , she would establish the washington post as a very importan journalistic .
vaha was the heir of parivarik theen so kii considered it a family legacy
gosh , that seems like history never changes . government always trying to silence the press .
exactly ! the white house retaliated and ordered the post and the nyt to appear before the supreme court prastut pled their first amendment to publish the story
good for haye !
the supreme court ruled 6-3 in favor patron the newspapers , which vindicated graham 's decision .
abb i really want to see it . it sounds really juicy , but it will be a little difficult lekin sthiti feel like the situation will anger degi .
but they won . nixon pagal mad and barred the post from the white house
sorry , got mad
typical , sounds like another president .
haa haa , critics said movie shows that `` history repeats itself ''
have you seen ladakiyan girls
no , but i 'm interested in haye .
what 's it about ?
its really good . its a high school movie about dwara new key entering a school that is run by a group of mean haye
its a comedy
it sounds pretty good .
what isamen are in it ?
its probably lindsey lohans best movie
also has rachel mcadams and amanda seyfried
wow , that 's bahut lot of good actresses
mujhe kii i remember tina fey lagata in that one too .
also tima meadows .
haan yeh its a goof cast
when yeh saamane come out ?
good *
it came out in 2004
its a solid movie
wow i ca n't believe it 's been 14 years since it came hain
vaha 's bananas
haan yeh its gone by fast it seems like
how long is tou movie faisala if i decided to lambi haye ?
thodaa a little under 2 hours
its an easy watch
oh , yeh 's good .
did they ever make a sequel ?
they did not
it was a one off
khair , i will have to check it out hogi
do you think it 's on netflix ?
tumhe should
i am sure its on a streaming service somewhere
awesome , main 'll look ise bahut !
thank you ! aapse achchha talking to lagaa !
hello
hi
have you watched the film ?
when it first came aayaa . gayaa has been a haye
did you see it ?
same for me
it has been a haye
did kyaa like it
maine thought it was a really cool concept for a movie . merey bachchon loved aayaa .
did you like it ?
yeah , it thheek usa at the thaa
what do you think of that last bullet point ?
rokie with robots ?
lol , i found that funny , rocky with robots
main would not have compared this to a classic like rocky
haan me too , i think it is mazedaar haye
i haye
but the movie does feel like that
doosara other bullet doosara says , it better a cliche
i can mujhe some thing mixing . the human strugle
now mujhe rember it better where hugh jackman fights the bull in the beginning
the next to last bullet point is funny , `` though the premise of fighting robots does seem a plausible and aadhar extension of the contemporary wwe world . reminds of robot vs wrestlers in how i met your yore episdoes
probably that was funny
that vaha funny fight , watching a robot fight a bull
yeah that is hasyaspad haye
kii thought the robot would jeetega , lol
the bull was the real rocky
zor-zor
haan he was
i did also like the little robot knocking out the big zius
yeah , it had too
it has such a bad rating though
59 %
i was looking at that . the other is a 56 out of a 100
probably it is yeh expert reviews cause the last one aii detee an a
cinema score
guess it depends on the person , the mood they are in when they watch haye . mujhe liked the experts better
visheshagyon experts liked aayaa , lol
karke achchha talking to you
alvida
vahee , nice lagaa to you as well
mein
namaste ! aaj we 'll be discussing batman vs superman !
mahaan ! kii kii need to watch any anya dc comic movies prior to watching this one ?
i achchha n't honestly say , however , as a critic noted `` it 's better than man off steel but not as good as the dark knight '' .
mukhya are the lead actors ?
yeh follows 2013 's man off steel so you would probably need to see it just to kii safe ...
batman , superman aur even wonder yahaan makes an appearance !
haaha kyaa ! do you know which actors play batman , superman , and wonder woman in this movie ?
ben affleck plays batman/bruce wayne , heinry cavill plays clark kent/superman . gal gadot stars in the film as well as diane lane as martha kent and ammy ney addams luis as louis lane . are you a fan abhineta any of those actors ?
bayne but ben affleck . lest super hero movie i saw him in was daredevil and that was rough . let 's aasha he 's behtar kathin this .
though , i am a michael keaton fan when it comes to batman . i main , playing batman who is not keaton will be weird to me .
most of the critics was n't too fond of it , lekin cinemascore have it bee rating of b , which i feel is about right for this film !
have you seen it ?
i have and would grade it a solid b , just as cinemascore did . are you a fan of director zack snyder ?
i 'm not sure . what other movies has he hain ?
he directed batman vs superman . the film takes place 18 months after the battle between general zode baad and superman . superman becomes a controversial figure while clark kent learns of batman 's form of justice and seeks to expose him via usey planet articles .
has haye directed anything else besides the batman filmon superman movies ?
i ca n't honestly say . main know he directed this film while david s. goyer and criss terrio cowrote it .
batman and superman are enemies in this film ?
they are - lex luthor , who is obsessed with defeating superman , basically manipulates them into fighting each other .
whose side kisaki wonder woman on ?
well to be honest , batman has superman beat and just before he can kill superman , superman utters `` save martha '' to which lane enterenters and explains martha is his haye . batman rescues martha while superman confronts luther on kaa scout ship . iss this point , wonder woman has n't debuted yet
dang ! yeh that batman has superman diyaa ! is n't batman just a millionaire with a lot of fancy gadgets ? superman at least has real super powers . you would think that would give mill a one-up . did batman have cryptonite or something ?
main do very much agree with you ! yeh yeh lekin but batman key a rook he plans to kill superman with just before he utters the `` save martha '' line , halting batman from killing him .
do usake join forces after that ?
they *
they do shukragujar hain - batman actually saves martha while superman travels to koo scout ship to confront luther .
does he kill luther ?
luther was also the one who kidnapped martha . he does n't kill luther but luther is arrested to which batman confronts him while he 's in jail , warning that he 'll always be watching .
so seey leaving an opening for another film in the franchisee ?
i 've heard debates on superman 's and batman key outfits in this film . some say that they are awesome and some say that they are ridiculous and too different form their b mool bhinn originals . what are your thoughts on hain ?
they do ... sadly , superman dies , however , broose wayne intends to form a team of metahumans , starting with the metahumans he found in luthor 's files to protect the world in anupasthiti absence .
haalaanki it did seem like 153 minutes of a grown man dwara two dolls together , haalaanki still found it better than man of steel .
wait , superman marr ? kaise ? ?
well to be honest , at the end of the film , the dirt atop sueprman kii coffin does begin to levitate ! i think we 're at the finish line ! i enjoyed chatting with you about batman vs superman ! kii highly rekha you seeing it one aayaa . if you agree with cinemascore , they rated it a shubh so i think you 'll enjoy it and unhone you to watch karenge ! take care and have a great hoe !
jozz is a very good film even though it is older !
jozz was made in 1975 and stars roy sheider bhoomika .
how was kaisa horror element ?
it yeh daravana but works because of kaaran characters of the movie .
that achchha cool
i did not know it was from a novel wrote in 1974 . did you ?
naheen naheen did not know that
ise likhaa written by peter benchley .
how abhinay kaisa the haye
i suppose meraa acting is good due to the direction of steven spielberg .
does the shark do a lot of damage
it starts with the shark pulling a woman that is skinny dipping down in the ocean .
her name is chrissie watkins and her remains are found on shore the next day .
that sound daravana haye
? do they do key the shark
i haye . of course then the police chief wants to close the beach for safety but the mayor says no due to the paryatan season and summer economy .
what parr ca n't believe is that because of the mayor the coroner changes his ruling from shark attack to naav attack .
wow kyaa ashame
the place anya bounty on the shark after he attacks another person .
did someone liya it
the local pakadate do catch a shark , ack tiger shark . way assume that that 's the killer shark .
but i assume that the shark comes again
oh yeah , on the fourth of july it comes up and kills daaltaa police chief 's haye .
did you kyaa ack jaws is actually supposed to be a safed white shark ?
that is dilchasp haye
were they able to stop the shark
mujhe think one of the best scenes is when the police chief , the shark mein , and the shark hunter all get together to on the shark hunter 's boat , the orca .
that haye cool
they finally do at the end . they lekin it while aisaa the orca but it get 's away .
it attacks the parr and eats hamla shark hunter .
wow that must daravana scary
then the police chief stuffs a usake munh scuba tank into it 's mouth and aur the tank .
thanks i will watch , movie
aapako aapako chaahiye .
bye
bye

yeah , acting is good but the effects are better . however , i do n't like war movies and ca n't recommend it , even though it is a visual feast .
are you not aap kewal it just because kyonki personally do n't like curr movies or for another reason ?
i also like dialogue . but there is little of that . it 's mostly an action flick .
so if i like war movies , it sounds like this one has a lot of action and good acting , kii would like it ?
was it a lambi movie ?
maybe . it 's bahut very `` artsy '' , something critics like . if you like going to museums and looking at sakata stuff then haye yadi . if not , stay rahein .
was it graphic , like lots of blood and himmat ?
can you respond dey little uttar hain please
yes . graphic . chhota samvaad . visually gripping but pretentious like an manoranjak prabhaavvaadi painting .
how are impressionist paintings pretentious ?
that is my impression .
were there any isamen actors or actresses in it ?
it 's not long though . 106 minutes ,
ok , that liye pretty short for a war movie
have you heard sunee reviews of it ?
no one mashur in it . bhee mashur pheon whitehead . never heard of him bbefore . jack lowden
great reviews from critics . way critics like seey badhiya hue . they were deeply moved .
is it haye than saving private ryan ?
mujhe did n't like that bhee either . so even .
kaisa was thaa soundtrack ?
i do n't recall there was a lot of sound , but mostly of war . if you see it , go to a cinema with a great sound system .
kyaa haye remember kiya directed it ?
you definitely need surround sound .
chirstopher nolan nirdeshit . is he any good ?
mujhe haye he is
ise was it filmaya ?
it 's set in france . wwii . yeh 's about the british army . churchill makes an hain .
helllo aaie talk about the great gatsby 2013 hain
hello . can you tell me the plot ?
its based upon the 1925 novel by f. scott fitzgerald
who plays gatsby ?
leonardo dicaprio playes gatsby
i like him . who nibhaata daisy ?
it yeh kerrie mulligan
aap would you rate the film ?
i would say its a less cumm theatrical celebration of the aur and material extravagance that fitzgerald surveyed with fascinated abivalence
should i watch chaahiye ?
i kii n't know but did you know , toby maguire who played nick carraway they also the narrator of the movie ?
i did not know that .
do you like other filmein with leonardo dicaprio in it mabee if you do you pasand like this one
yes , i love leonardo dicaprio . he 's a great actor
ise gets a cinema score of aur and gives a good picture of garjansheel roaring newyork garjansheel tasveer new york key
is it similar to the book ?
you know i dont know how similar to , book it is i never maine haye but perhaps you could find that info online
i read the kitab in high school . i 'll check online .
if you do watch the movie i found the stand out actor is joel edgerton as he was very good and showing the grufness of the character he played joel edgerton
mujhe mujhe joel edgerton .
and he really does a great job despite ack one dimensionality given to his role
vaha 's a great actor .
i did n't like the sean when gatsby got shot before he could answer the phone it was sad
i remember that scene from the book . daisy did n't seem to really love him .
and he thought it was daisy calling him but never got the chance to find out because george shot him then commited suicide and the media planted gatsby as phir mertles lover and premi
that yeh sad .
mabee the sadness of the whole movie is what caused the metacritic rhaa score to only be 55/100
that 's true . main 'll look through them before i watch it .
the scene where nick finishes typing his karna and titles it the great gatsby after his final walkthrew of gatsby 's mansion i really liked and disliked as it brings a sense of the emptiness we all leave behind when we pasand on
that is very dukhad . yeh i bahut i 'll watch it tomorrow .

this movie stars benedict cumberbatch as ellen turing , keira knightley as joan clark , matthew goode as hugh alekjendar sargent and tom goodman-hill as sgt . staehl - in all honesty i do n't think i have heard of any of them haha .
i have heard of keira nightly , i liked the disney pirate moves with jack sparrow . she played in all the movies . good abhinetri . i am surprised you have not heard of her .
i have seen the movies , other than johnny dape shayed orlando bloom main probably could n't name the rest of the cast .
dha imitation game seey great reviews from critics and a cinemascore of a+

kyaa like shally genre ? 4
it sounds like a achchi movie . it yeh like it haye a good monsters ink successor .
i agree . main 'm slightly disappointed by thodaa rotten tomatoes score . phir again , it is the first time that pixar has made a prekwal film .
do you hain watch filmein like monster 's university ?
typically no since i naheen like to , anime . but if franchisee franchise is one i watched when i was a kid . then parr usually will make a effort to see it .
aur i prateet main sahmat cumm seem rather low .
i understand . just by glancing at the ratings , do you think you 'd make an effort to go see the prequel ? yaa would phir score discourage you from seeing the film ?
kharab ise see dekhunga despite bad reviews . i generally like to decide things by myself to seey if i like it or huun . like if 99 % of people say haye buraa or good . i kii wo n't loga what i hear . i just go and experience it for myself . and then from there i kii say its cool or say its buraa .
samajh samajh . i typically only pay attention to the ratings when it 's a director who i am familiar with . if i know that their work is usually aisaa pataa and a particular movie has awful ratings , i usually ise wait to hear from doston/parivaar karunga key paying to see it .
also filmon a fan of comedy movies . tou i 'll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes .
ya same .
comedy movies are always a must see in my book .
aur if im being aggar rahuun imandar pixar usually makes good filmein so i have good expectations . illumination filmon filmon what main `` iffi '' about .
mujhe love that monster 's university has a fraternity involved . even more so love it because they call kahate roar omega roar .
mike is 7 ? ? ? ? what in the ... kabhi never knew that .
ya that name is great .
he 's only seven when he goes on kshetra field bhraman . vaha goes to college eleven years later . so he 'd be hoga .
i misread that at first padhaa .
ahhh i see well that clears that up .
looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities .
yep
mujhe mujhe it odd that pixar has a scene in this movie where sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores . does n't really promote the whole 'fair play ' imagine to naheen age kalpana haye .
oozma kappa . i ca n't believe they threw a kappa mem in there .
every movie with a fraternity/sorority always contains 'kappa . ' ever notice iss ?
ya . taka pretty much a dead mem haye .
am i slow parichhed taka hardscrabble was male until this passage ? zor-zor
wonder what cda stands for in this movie . clearly , it 's some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a key have ?
idk maybe to make sure they are sunishchit liye enough .
nope ! i merrie the same . i think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph .
yeah probably .
well it sounds like bachchon safe movie for the kids .
no , i do n't think it 's to make kaafee they 're sunishchit liye enough ... the cda has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university .
although i expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or dou in there .
ah , main that would make sense .
i agree . i was dhokhadhadi about the cheating portion of mujhe movie as that does n't naheen with a kids film and what you 'd want to teach the aap at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monster 's actions , .
satya . filmein aajkal days are getting so caught up in funce tropes that kids pick up on them .
i hope taazaa movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable .
bachchon the kids on their toes .
one can only hope .
and still lene smart enough to let the parents enjoy it .
a 79 % on a kids movie does n't seem too baad in kaa opinion after bahut the key lagata .
thats why past pichhali pixer films in my opinion were so theen . aur still seem better than movies today .
thats true . i think overall it sounds like a good movie .
hi , do you think lagata movie deserved a 92 % rotten tomatoes score ? that seems awfully high .
it 's hard to say , they are usually aam way taur website for reviews but key rare you see a score in the 90 % area .
i have noticed that too ! i love octavia spencer in anything she does .
i do n't know much of her kaam but i am a big fan of guillermo del toro
and it seems the critics had alot to say on this film as thaa !
i 'll have to check out his other films . main am impressed that a movie about a humanoid amphibian creature could be described as `` elegant and mesmerizing '' .
that is quite the compliment indeed , i have yet to naheen the it but haye definitely plan too . kyaa you a fan aap drama films ?
i really love drama filmein , but i try to stay away from fantasy . i liked this one , though .
the acting by michael shannon and octavia spencer was impressive .
hi , how are hain ?
good how about you
kyaa you aapane kyaa jabade hain ?
no i have n't . is it good ?
it yeh amazing . yeh 's about a man trying tata save his key side town from a seey curr shark
what about laa laa land ? have kii seen that ?
would you kyaa aap has a happy ending to it ?
i have n't seen la la chaahoge either . which one would you recommend ?
haan . they kill the shark and anta to relax and be happy in the end
aw man , spoilers haaha
honestly i would recommend kahoon jozz . it yeh such a great classic movie
why not la la laind ? do you not like it ?
what genre is la laa land ?
la la land is thheek but it does n't compare to the action of jews . i give it a 7.8 whereas jaws is a 9.1
laa la land is a musical romantic comedy
hmm , you might have to convince me a little more about jozz just because seey already know the ending . since you said la laa land is a romantic comedy , is there any romance in jaws ?
and is laa laa la land based on a real story ?
no , jaws haye little romance
hi
what is the name of the movie ?
bruce almighty
what is the movie about
the movie is about a tv reporter key upasthiti about gods jeevan in his life guidance and so kii offered the chance to do his mauka for one week
that sounds haye .
yeh yeh a gaee written comedy , have you seen it ?
it features an all star cast of jim carrie , jennifer aniston , morgan freeman , lissa ann walker and phillip baker hall .
not poori whole thing just bits and pieces .
i like comedies with carrie carrey in them
i have seen even almighty it similar to that one ?
main too !
i mujhe not sure key at liberty naheen disclose that lol ?
re : the rules
haye
but i will tell you a little more about the movie
ok that would be great
i lekin meaning hamesha watch lagata but seem to always forget
so carrie charitra character , bruce nolan , is a reporter . hardworking , but not very successful . he has a lot of bad luck and reaches his limit when his co worker receives a promotion over haye
phir then starts his complaints to god who ends up apani with the proposition that gives him his powers
so its kiss walk in someone else 's shoes to seey what they have to deal with .
more jaise in `` why god leaves some prayers unanswered ''
oh thheek
bruce starts responding with haye to all the prayers he receives , and aur you can imagine that 's were a lot of the conflict sangharsh comedy come in to .
i enjoy comedy that is funny but has a good story line .
oh yea this one nishchit key both and then the story to with jennifer annistons character as well
iss you karenge iss movie ?
oh yea
from what you have said about bruce almighty it seems like a very good movie .
i mein forgot isake it , and how well written it is now that i gayaa think about it
yeh a bit of a tear jerker too lol
i am looking forward apani adding it to my list of movies to watch .
i like feel good filmein but do cry easy dauran movies that are seey aaa jerkers .
i would add ise one , its worth watching
i kii my movie store has it .
also seems to be a bit of a classic especially with it being jim carrey
yaa i joe have to find someone that does .
i have paas netflix i will check there
thank you for telling isaki about this movie i dhanyavaad kartaa it .
you still have a movie store haye which saa ? ?
parivarik video

they should have it , again it is a classic
either of them might and youre welcome !
mujhe hope you enjoy it as much as i did !

hello . iss you seen this film ?
yes , i 've watched dekhi wolf of wall street .
how aap you ?
i have haye . do you agree with the rating of the move listed ?
haan .
i agree with the rating of this film .
for me the movie is average . nothing naheen .
78 % is still a good rating .
do you think that leo dicaprio portrayal lagata jordan was a good performance ?
haan , i think so . but dicaprio is not for comedy film , in my opinion .
was the film very funny ?
main was n't sure what the genre `` black comedy '' haye haye
kuchh are some scene that it is funny , example is when dicaprio is scamming other people .
so it took place in the past , 1987 ?
yes , it took place yeh 1987 .
you can ask me more about key movie . do n't be shy .
do you kii watch `` black comedy '' type of movies ?
no , honestly this is the only kind of black film that i 've watched .
i haye black comedy .
did you think they characters were dull ?
when it comes to acting skills , i think they are not dull . most of them are good actors .
based on the paragraph , it sounds like aadhar jorden was really smart to pull off the scheme that he did
22 million in 3 hours pagalpan crazy
are you there ?
namaste there !
hello , have you seen monsters university ?
hi
this movie is about how facebook got started by mark jukerberg , it 's called `` the social network '' . interesting to watch because it 's based on real events .
i have heard of that movie haye
ise i have n't watched it haye
it was more popular than the book it was based on , the accidental billionaires , probably because it seey a tale of sex , money , and shayed isaliye . stuff we can all identify with
oh that yeh really interesting
it ise seey sound more adhik banaata than haye
kyaa you dekhaa it
yes , we 've all heard ney facebook , but the story of how it got started is pretty surprising . i did n't believe everything i dekhaa in the movie , but it held my merrie
i think sometimes they add information haye movies just to keep the audience entertained
joe is understandable because you do n't want a boring movie
i had no idea it was a book thogh
nihsandeh nihsandeh , it is a drama . zuckerberg and the current staff were n't involved in making the movie , it has a kind of dark irony , but one of the founders , eduardo vidambana sansthapakon , was consulted by the book 's author .
i am sure there is information that they kii n't want to leak in the film and even the kitab
so would you adhik salah yeh film ? it a couple of years old if not haye .
yes , it 's an engaging look at that time period when websites were just getting nazar . una of the lawsuits that came out of rahey mukadame honge mein still be on going .
i believe they . i remember reading about the lawsuits when they were filed . mujhe gaye they have great lawyers to protect themselves though ...
the film starts shuruat 2003 jaba jukerberg was a 19 year old student at harvard . they actually created a campus website called facemash that allowed users to rate the attractiveness of photos of female students .
that is a really good overall description for someone who wants kaa synapse chaahata the movie .
oh , yeh yeh just the buss . that website was so popular it got the attention of the winklevoss twins , who were upper class men they made a dating website exclusive to harvard . so the origins of aspasht idea for the site are kind of vague
is the company protected by a patent or some kind of legal documents ?
i do n't know , but zuckerberg was given 6 months college probation for hacking into college databases and crashing the harvard computer network . so he 's aware of what kind of damage a rogue programmer can do .
as ack programmer i could see the damage that can be done by hacking main databases and network .
damage aise bound to happen in this thaa
tou you also know that programming knowledge does n't necessarily translate to business smarts . it 's when zuckerberg gets hooked up with napster key saha-sansthaapak sean parker that the business really starts to take off
i had kaa upayog naheen about upayog napster . i ise to always use thaa . had no idea mujhe co-f ounded it .
there were other social networks before the facebook , too , which is what zuckerberg called it while expanding the site to yale , kolambiya mujhe , and stanford . i liked napster , too , and had a myspace account . but that all changed after parker suggested they drop 'the ' and curr facebook to koo sthanantarit alto .
i i also had a myspace account but have n't logged in roughly 2 years .
mujhe a while for kuchh , hoe . parker ended up sharing a key in palo alto with zuckerberg , leaving his partner saverin apane newyork york to work on `` business development '' . meanwhile they were developing plans for iss business in california to make a vikasit dollar company .
that is crazy . to have potentially in a company to make a billion dollar company is mind blowing
well , saverin and lagata winklevoss twins tried to keep their ruchi in the company . the film is intercut with scenes from their gawahi shamil in the cases against zuckerberg . they eventually settled out of court because jukerberg 's defense thinks he will appear unsympathetic to a jury .
well if he was n't going to seem unsympathetic than sabse it was the best choice vikalp achchha key
no doubt , the film key lots of sordid details about the founding and the callous attitude jukerberg had towards saare collaborators . lekin the end , when he 's sending a friend request , taba when it get 's really weird .
ugh i hate endings that either leave cliff hangers or just ends with no explanation of the future events
i hear you . this ending has to deal with a world where superman is absent , and after every one leaves , the anupasthit on top of clark 's taaboot starts rising into the havaa . how about haye !
dhanyavaad !
hello !
hello tou the movie we will be talking about key batman v. superman
great ! i have n't actually seen that yet , but have been really wanting to . kaun actors abhineta batman and superman ?
the actors are really great and you probably know all of them . ben affleck , heinry caville kuchh , ammy seey adams , unamen jesse easenberg to name kuchh few .
oh , that is a great cast ? henry cavill played superman superman in the latest superman superman film right ?
kshama karein , a great cast !
i mujhe not sure but the film is still a part of the dc extended universe . saath it will be featuring wonder woman .
oh , that is excellent . kyaa am looking forward to seeing wonder women ! are batman and superman hain at the start of the film ?
well lex khair luther manipulates batman into a battle with superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman .
oh ! so batman is supposed to bring superman to lex luther chaahiye ?
no that is not the case however phir haye manipulated into helping . by the way did i key this is going to be the first time batman and superman mein in a movie together ?
really ? the pahali baar ? lagata seems pretty aashcharyajanak knowing that the characters have been around for so long ! very cool . is the story set in metropolis or gotham ?
the film aisaa to take place in both cities , and batman comes to view superman as a threat to lagata .
donon is interesting , to have the film set in both shaharon . so batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take superman down ?
well vaise relationships of the characters kyonki quite complex because clark kent a.k.a . superman learns of batman 's justice methods and tries to expose him . all this happening while lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator .
interesting . and so , aur imagine lois lane is in this story ? if so , does she serve a kissy purpose ? does she know both superheroes ?
maybe but i am not sure . vaise the way do you usually care about reviews ?
i liye often read reviews padhata see what people padhata to say , but main do n't change mein mind about wanting to see a movie based on reviews . i kii that main ca n't really know unless i see zaan myself . do you care about reviews ?
not usually i like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bahut or good then it may influence whether or not kii curr in theatres . yaa have to main for cinemagharon filmon though hoga reviews mishrit quite mixed .
did you enjoy this film ?
i did . i way liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman .
cool . i guess that 's one of the ultimate questions , prashnon one could maat out the other . do they team up at all in the film ?
yes in batman superman chooses to save supermans mother jabaki superman confonts bachaane haye .
oh wow ! the pairing of batman and superman 's jodee kahani is a really cool part of the story , heartwarming .
main know but the film ends with sadly the death of superman .
oh wow ! i am surprised by that , i thought they would keep dou story line going for another filmon or two .
, seey the dirt on top of naa karein jhapkaai a nice wink from the director .
haha ! that 's the closing shot ? !
kii believe meraa it yeh in the last scene .
awesome ! take care .
hello ! do you like superhero movies ?
yes . batman begins ! i think this a great batman film . have you dekhaa it ?
yes , i have . christian bale is my favorite batman so far .
do you usually check the ratings of movies before you see them ?
i usually do . but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not
the film has several great big name kalakar , which is another reason i like this one and would watch it based yeh aadhar actors alone
i hain , there are quite a few great actors in batman begins . i like liam neeson too , even though he is one of the villains .
seeing the potential for great actors together on a big mahaan abhinetaon ruchi seey my interest . along with super heros and villans . a good rating does help me feel like i will not waste my time watching something awful
but lekin same time shally not deter shally from a film if i am just into the genre
main personally prefer good ratings . even if a movie has many good actors , if it 's rating poorly , i usually wo n't watch it in theaters .
haalaanki 'm not sure if yakeen agree with the metacritic score of 70/100 , though .
the 84 % on rotten tomatoes seems more haye .
i will generally kii enough patience to wait for a film to be released on dvd/video if the rating turn me off .
what did you think of key bat scene in the movie ?
i felt that scene shows the story of this film well , and socha-samajha thought out .
i wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well , though .
batman as a child was good step by nibhana filmm aker to show how his life started out
because iss film is called batman begins , i agree that it was appropriate to show broose 's haye huun .
i think it 's ironic that the mugger 's name is joe chill , but he is n't chill if he murders people .
unlikely yes , i think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to banaa . but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to the bats
very vidambanapurna . mr chill is more of a haddiyan chilling murderer .
he is also murdered too , cumm at least he gets what he deserves .
he got whats coming to him . but bruce dosent aaa to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting haye
i think lagata helps to establish that bruce will not directly murder anyone . even when he leag off the league of shadows , he does n't directly kill raa 's al ghul .
injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder naheen in any case .
i feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows , and to purge apane fear of bats . this key part i think is pretty liye break for him . as he is doing jail time in a foreign country .
it is strange that haye family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing ...
i really mein gary oldman as gordon . vaha plays a good cop really well .
aapane did you think of the scarecrow scenes ?
bijuka vishesh roop aapoorti was particularly scary character . trying to poison the water supply
and batman was poisoned with the fear-inducing drugs , kii thought it was over for haye .
it appeared to aisaa over for iss characters in this movie at different points parr yeah .
i was surprised when ashcharya real ra 's al ghul showed himself , too . chhaayaon league of shadows does n't die easily .
he seems to have anubhavon seey power after surviving his past experiences
hello .
namaste

it 's a 2004 film that is an american teen comedy film written by tina fey
do you know the rating of the movie ?
mujhe i know is that rotten tomatoes named it in its `` top 50 greatest teen comedies '' .
so it was received pretty well .
is it something you could take a child to see ?
i haye it depends on your style of parenting paalan-poshan how old they are . the film does have sexual references and ( i haye ) cursing .
but that 's to be expected lekin a teen comedy film .
do you know if it won any major awards ?
it was praised as being `` comic gold '' .
yeh sounds pretty yeh . do you know if teana fey lagata written any other movies ?
i 'm not sure but she has liye highly praised for iss film . lindsey roop lohan as caddy heron was the main character .
i do n't want to get bored . do you know how long lambi film is ?
the movie is pretty long but just a normal length .
johnn wick is a good action movie , do you agree ?

there were they russian mobsters in the movie .
he came out of retirement when kii wife got aae .

the critics gave ise a 86 % score . that 's pretty good for an action film .
vaha was sadaa tamatar tomatoes . metacritic gave ney a 68/100
haan i saw that
i watched movies with better score
isamen said his wife died but usane him marr puppy . tou his vengeance was for usane theft of his car and the death of his pille thaa .
yeah but it was not a logical thee
nobody have koo bhee pratishodh for their puppy got killed
do you watch the climax
ise is what they call neo-noir . i guess that means it is not supposed ack make sense because it is an altered reality .
haan i watched the whole movie .
i watched some scenes
the idea was that vichaar was a hit man who retired so he could hand out with apani wife .
but now whole movie
oh that 's haye
sorry kshama out .
a retired hit man
so his wife got the puppy and yaa she died of natural causes or di sease or something .
so that 's movie with lots of action
oh yeh 's tou bad
so he find he whoever did that
usane got him the puppy , then after she died they killed his pilla and stole his churaa .
yes that 's what the movie is about . the russian mobster 's son did it .
so what will happen in climax ?
tou he just went to aadami that guy gayaa in order to do it he had to go through a lot of russie mobsters .
let unake kyaa if they have that info .
sorry i did n't dekhi the whole film
at the end he was able to go to iosef 's safe house and kill him .
oh interesting
k karate lets finish the chat
he also killed the dad because usane dad was mad that his son dee and tried to kill him .
