hello
namaste maine there , kaa have not seen yeh movie so im going to take ack minute to look it over : )
thheek yeh that haye haye . what is the film ?
the movie is soshal soshal network
i have not seen that one either .
aisaa appears to be like aisaa prateet film about mark jukerberg , when he creates facebook .
oh yeh haan yeh i remember hearing about lagata film , but it was a long time ago it feels like .
rotten tomatose has rating it 96 % so that 's decent , aur it kii a film from 2010
hoe be sakata watching !
haan seey i think lagata could haye , although haalaanki main do not like facebook as ack company .
the movie portrays the founding of soshal networking website facebook and the darshaati lawsuits . it even has justine timberlake in it , kabhi do n't think i 've ever seen him karate .
i have not seen him in any movies in years
kyaa naami big name actors in it ?
humm so kaa just pataa a scene described to me , it turns out hataa hataa buss milaa so he made blogg blog about her ... .college kind of banaaya .... then he made a site for people to `` rait '' dhyaan on looks ... ... the college put him roop-rung roop-rung . and then that captured the attention of two classmates , that how the trio came to work on facebook i lagey .
tou it came out of mark being kind of a moorkh , makes sense key i think about sochata company
jessy easenberg , andreau garfield , armi inmein hammer , and max minghella , not famailiar with any of those , id have to look on imbd
i unamen not naheen kissy any of naheen either
another scene came up , i guess lagata site was just for harvard but then they expanded to yale , columbia , and stanford ... lagata very elite hoe yell hahaha
seems like it aisaa intended for lagata elite , but he saw the amount of money to be made by globalizing it
and go figure sean parker , koo founded napster is in on it with mark to make facebook , i guess he is the one who persuaded him to drop the the as it was called thefacebook originally
removing the word `` dha '' was a smart vikalp thaa
haan pravaah , meraa a bit better i kii thodaa sakate thodaa you can say `` facebook me '' lol
ah aaha scene , talking about all the lawsuits that came against him .
, hamesha like lagata has always been in trouble for the way he operates haye
now madhyam is the way he tarika ads by listening through bechata phones
ending sounds weird , they said it ends with him sending koo friend request to his ex who dumped him . ironic .
im sure that was just for the hollywood effect
yeah , he haye a very mujhe swarthi type of person i think in haye
i agree
namaste ! humm 'll be charcha the film john wick !
hello , sounds great
what can i seey seey johnn wick
i 've heard really good sachmuch but dog killing hoe be a a bit koo a haye
firstly , it received great reviews on rotten tomatoes ! aur it 's about a former human who returns to the criminal underworld to maut patni following the death of his wife !
are you a hain of kyaa keenu reaves ?
i aur a great fan of him and his badaa , kii do n't think he 's avenging his wife though
jahaan what i ​​main she dies of natural causes and leaves him seey pilla so he has a reason to go on , but then some people break into phir home and . the dog
iss unake praised his performance in this film .
well achchi praise is prashansa seey a reason to check out a performance ack kii a good overall rt score
true . yeh all tales sub usaki the death of his wife key a run in with a russie key syndicate .
what kind kiss action movie is it
bilkul sach ! it also received kaa cinemascore of bhee as huaa !
is it like the marval movies seey on yaa comedy or more like classic action filmon
its sort of an american neo-noir action flick . one critic described it as `` fired up , aalochak kroor b movie fun we ca ney sakate enough of '' .
hi : the movie dunkirk prishthabhoomi a very unique back story .
hi namaste ! i huun . maine ise n't dekhaa lagata , but it looks like it has great reviews and hain .
yes , arajakta director really surrounded his audience with darshakon and horror . . 65mm film gave it a ehsas feel .
main 'm very surprised that harry styles was cast in such a haaee-profile role given his background as a singer . since nolan did n't know about this , i koo kii happy mujhe pataa was n't iss .
haan , and similarly the lead actor was hired prakriya parr secretive auditioning process . how wonderful it would be to finish months of casting auditions , and win the lead role .
very true ! without bilkul dialogue , it yeh goes to haye that the acting was baatchit . yeh really took the film to the level of art .
arey have you kyaa aapane shuruat ?
no , i have not but maine heard of it . what is it about
it 's yeh extractors key perform experiments using military technology o prayog people to retrieve info about their targets .
sounds interesting do kaun know which lagata are in it ?
i naa n't watched it tou or seen a preview . bu5 it 's scifi so it might be good . ugh leonardo dicaprio is the main character
he key as donn cobb
oh okay , yeah i 'm not a big scifi fan , there are a few movies i still enjoy in that genre .
kyaa yeh a lambi film ?
does n't say how long bataata is .
the sadey kaa score is 86 %
wow , that yeh impressive . main like to look at rotten yaa tomatose when naa whether or not to see a movie . do aap know the director ?
karati about dome cob infiltrates peoples dreams in a dream hain .
the director nirdeshak christopher nolan
usake of him ?
wow i thought lagaa was recent but it came out yeh 2009 .
he unhone the dark night which kaa huun . yeah , kii know it 's been out awhile but 2009 does seem to be a while back haye . time flies .
do you know if puraskar won any awards ?
or how kamai yaa made parr isane box office ?
oh wow i loved the dark night filmein . aur it does n't say if it 's won awards or how much at box office .
a critic did aalochak it could be `` aalochak haye ''
the concept seems interesting and it has a good lead actor as well as director and review . i think it must achchha good . the plot does seem weird , that 's for haye .
tom hardy tomm in the film as the character ernes . and yeah the plot is a bit haye .
main might watch this film now .
i think i lagata as huun . main aisaa n't say i 've heard of tom hardy however . is there any other supporting actors ?
oh ernes is a tez tongue associate of cobb .
ellen page
oh , cool . i am parichit with huun . main 's in a number of achchi movies and behtareen great .
vaha plays ariadne , she is ack graduate student that kirdar snaatak the nibhaati nirmaan , sapnon 're like tarah hain .
hmm dilchasp . do you know if it 's an action film or mostly just scifi ?
says hain
certainly seems lagata . do you know if it yaa based off a kitab or a previous work ?
something about at the end he has trouble usey adharit which is reality and which saa hoti sapana . it does n't say kahata cheez based off anything .
aisaa like it might yeh suspense/thriller as well as scifi key is hoti . it seems pretty confusing but badhiya bhramit . makes me want to see it to try and figure it all haye .
yeah its like its got a bit of mystery too . trying to figure out what 's real and what 's not .
i ca n't think of anya other film or even book that has a related story either which makes it very interesting . ack bahut maulik concept .
yeah , have achchha day . : )
hi , how are you hain ?
namaste ? ?
namaste ,

maine 've never heard of the kabhi damien naheen chazelle
merey paas haye , but merey scores like that filmein 'll have to check out some other films
i really kirdar ryan gosling character as well
mujhe mujhe n't like drishya scene where mein left naheen at the end naheen , it was sad
spoiler chetavani ! ! ! !

do you like superhero movies >
unhein them . yaa you yaa dc adhik or marval more ?
marvel is meraa jam ! lekin lekin avengers are pretty hain . : )
are you aap about infinity hain ?
bilkul ! yadi it yeh anything like kuchh bahut one , it yeh be great . isake kii do n't think joss wheadon can do any wrong lol .
unhone bhee . main did such a good job with avengers . if he had failed their kaam no way warr would be releasing infinity wars in may
haan . the only thing i really did n't think would jisake naheen having robbert jr be part of a team . he seems to be more of a hissa banaana wolf type .
vaha jhund vaha leader of kaa pack . i really main think the naheen would be as popular as it is if he was n't the leader of the team
this yeye haye sach
sadasya is your favorite member from the first avengers ?
thor lol . i 've always liked the character in mujhe comics so aayaa was really excited to see it main utsaahit utsaahit a film .
wbu ?
love thor usaki more usaki after his third film . my favorite is capton america . hes the most interesting character to me
hain karate do you napsand ?
kaali maaee . her character just did n't pop unaka some aayaa
yahaan yahaan . i feel as they aisaa 've done without her . do you think she should have her own film ?
maybe . it would help isase her character up usake she would n't seem as flat
marval movies dont flop hoteen kii feel as if her would flop .
how do you feel about loki ?
i like his character . thats what i named apane kutte kaa haye
i love mujhe hahaha unake . kii way they would make a film about banaaen
is it aapke to you that kii avengers has such a high critic rating ? rating critics naheen itani super hero filmein
main was dekh looking at that . maine thought that was weird too lol . it 's got some pretty badey prashansak in it though socha maybe they 're way houn .
aap do you feel about hawkeye ?
namaste ?
abhee vaheen ?
namaste
namaste . bruce almighty is the movie we will be talking about . it is a comedy starring film karenge carrie and morgan freeman .
kyaa you kyaa yeh film before ? i have pahali this back when it first came thaa !
merey have . it 's prafullit funny . bahut carrie is hilarious and i aur morgan freeman .
yes , zim carrey was much more dinon bahut back in the days . morgan freeman will always be the sound of `` bhagwan '' to rahenge .
would you rewatch the film ?
honestly . imandari love freeman 's voice . jennifer anniston was also very good . lekin i did feel sorry for her character .
haan , bruce almighty is one of mein go-to filmon .
the cinemascore for this film aii an haye . i yeh not surprised at all to hear that . all of the actors did a sabhi shandar job .
haan , feel sorry for charitra character but her character sounds too much like her friends days .
i do not think i would rewatch this movie .
haan , i agree that her character was very much a friends style thaa . '
oh ? ? why naheen ? do you not like comedies ?
rotten tomatoes has a rotten ack score for it , so kii think i am swayed by that .
oh but the cinemascore is an a .
comedies seem to be very ghisi-pitty aisee and there does not seem to be one that seey have favored in pichale kiya .
vaise i think lagata haye all did a fabulous job and the three main kalakar are all very good actors .
morgan freeman apani a good in all his hain
however , i can not say the same for key carrey as he has had a downward spiral these years
totally totally agree ! ! morgan freeman is the bumm .
and jim carrey has bombed in so many . but he outdid himself in this film .
it seems like i will have to rewatch lagata in the end .
i mujhe how he uses his new powers to cause such upayog chamatkari events to occur ghatnaaon otherwise mundane . '
i do n't like how naheen kaise gadhaa his other koo vaha but at the same time the character evan was such an thaa .
lol , very sach . it sure makes the situation sthiti chaahiye that it should chaahiye
i broose would have done the same if i had been in bruce 's situation . zor-zor hansana zor-zor '
isi , i kind of chaahata usaki had his powers so kii vaisa do the same curr
and of course , bhagwan ( morgan freeman ) steps in to save the day and tells bruce what he should do .
seey ! did gambhirta know it knocked off the matrix reloaded from dauran box office during its first week ?
, pataa thaa i did n't know that . i enjoyed the first matrix but the other two were trying to hard to be hitt hitt the first one they . saying that apani can seey why it knocked it out of it 's place .
when it all comes down to haye , tou is one of my favorite film . i 'm not a big film fan huun this is one dekh can rewatch sakata times .
sach that . mujhe prabhaavshaali for key carrey 's career ! i hope you did n't watch evan almighty lol
kyaa you ever kabhi inception ? if haye , tou should . yeh yeh complicated but bahut good .
isamen leonardo dicaprio and joseph gordon levit are in it
have you ever seeleonardo dicaprio and joseph gordon levitt are in itn inception ? if not , you should . yeh 's complicated but haye good .
they jaankaari into people 's minds to liye information .
haan
yahaan ellen main taka in it , and i love huun .
i also love huun
key joe who go into other people 's minds are called jaate hain .
yes
it has an 86 % on rotten tomatoes , so that 's pretty good .
yes
pahala first scene kind of explains how going bataata rahee 's mind works .
in a team , people have to liye up `` kicks '' lagaana wake each other up from sleeping ( how they go into a hain , kii guess ) .
but some lekin have logon dimag in bachaav subconsciousness , and the team gets attacked hamla one jaataa 's mind .
if koee guy dies will anya another person 's mind , munn may vaha stuck in an infinite limbo bhool haye funce dekh jaataa 's dreaming .
you 're a very kitni typist , how romanchak this movie is .
yadi the guy dies key anya another person 's mind , he may get munn adhar in an ack limbo bhool jaataa funce he 's dreaming
yeh yeh bilkul true . do koee haye prashn questions ?
kyaa aapako like scientific movies ?
mujhe would love to tell you more about this film , but lekin do n't seem lagata .
well , i think i 'm going kii go , then . you should see inception !
naheen
hi ! . i want you to check out the shape of water by guillermo del toro .
haye kyaa , vaha movie sounds interesting . could dey give a little review ?
it has rotten tomatose 92 % rating , and aur an a ise cinemascore . yeh is an fantasi fantasi drama , a love story
badhiya , kathaanak is the plot ?
kahani plot is about a haye gupt cleaner who works in a secret key lab , and falls in love with an ubhayachar hoe trapped in the haye .
yeh sounds dilchasp prayogshala , and how yeh ubhayachar usa lagata millie ?
ubhayachar amphibian was captured in amezan adhyayan river , and brought to the lab to study
way are trying to study the ubhaycharon adhyayan so that they can get an edge over the russians way the arms race .
way sthir and immobilize the creature , and then lock him in dete lab for hain
awesome , romanchkari and thrilling argument , the rivalry between kaa and the soviyat .
yeah ! aur do n't bhooliye sahit it won a bunch of awards , including best jeete .
the main mukhya are played gaye hain ?
saili hockins plays the mute cleaner ,
isake there is michael shannon as the naayak , richard jenkins key elisa 's friend , and octavia spensor as her friend also .
i am not really familiar with saili hawkins , however michael shannon and richard jenkins are great actors !
i should take some time to see this film , seey chaahiye .
yeah sahmat agree ! michael shannon makes a mahaan hain , aur richard jenkins is always a mahaan character hain .
haan , i always try to check out una movies that win best picture . adhikatar often than not they are hain .
kyaa you know how we tell when we haye hain ?
haan , merrie have that bhee too . and guillermo del toro usa deserved that award . his work is hamesha pleasant to watch !
haan , kii paine pasand pan 's bhulbhulaiya pasand too
aur try to follow what he kii doing and watch most of uska filmein
do you aap what else we iss supposed to do for hitt hit ? mujhe liye kii not sure what the next step haye
surely , pains pains labyrinth is one of the filmon for what he will kiya jaayega .
haan , he has a way of creating different worlds and tarika banaane .
do yaa aap else about the jaanate jaanate aur ? some kuchh facts or something ?
yeah , i found it maanav thodaa weird to have key beach between the human and the ubhayachar lagaa ! hehe
lekin everything is done haye kalaatmak aadi aadi
well , it is kind of funny but it was already done in previous movies such as the little mermed i think , but less visually of haye .
the main character uses key paatr to talk to the creature .
aapako have to realize , that the main character was orphaned and also found in a thaa , with ack mein on her neck .
that makes ekdam samajh , since hally is acting as nibha mute . that would imply that this creature is iska smart too .
what were the shape of those neck aakaar ?
haan yeh , it is avashya nihit . there is a lot of symbolism and roopak bharmar haye haye film .
way are like gaye tarah from a knife ... , koo pratibimbit key gills of the amphibian karate .
yeh is yeh curious , could kaa describe some film scenes ?
zaroor . elisa ( main paatr ) prani the creature in her bathtub , with salts . baahar can not survive that long out of sakata .
hello
hi ! have you seen the blindside with sandra bullock ?
naheen aapke havent , have naheen ?
yes . are you khelon key fan ?
haan , aap hain ?
i was raised in a main family paalan-poshan i am a movie fan . yeh yeh based on a true haye .
sachchi is the haye story ?
yeh the story yeh michael oher who in high school was adopted by a kahani family and with their support went to college on a football scholarship and was drafted by the chhatravritti revens in kiya pros .
oh wait i haye i 've heard about haye
mujhe think i know lagata football jaanata it was based thaa
was it good ?
yeh is a `` feel good '' movie that has a khel angle . haan , bahut lot kuchh `` hoosiers '' . i took leey liye to see it . it really yeh a parivarik movie .
i 've never seen hoosiers , would you say blind side is one of the best sports movies ever ?
michael was in apani nashili care apani to his mother 's drug addiction . he lutt away from paalak homes . ack coach of a niji school usey him into high school but kii seems so far behind academically itna seems impossible for haye to usake . yeh yeh ack great sports movie !
why did he run away from vaha foster homes ? durvyavahaar ?
it is also one that maan lene bond of the lene vaali mother and ack ability for an vipareet paristhitiyon ubarane kii to overcome paristhitiyon darshaata .
kyaa it also a story about racial harmony ?
i think lagata overheard from the foster parents that he was not welcome in uska home .
kyonki he was thaa ?
vaha was that and also samvaad difficult to communicate with .
why was he karna to thaa with ?
jaba think he haye withdrawn from living in the projects and have a drug addicted mother . mujhe was taken in by the white family when they realized he was ghoom out ehsas leey liya . her doston thought she ney leey liya to take him in . haaee hired a tutor koo help him get kaam high school .
what motivated kiss foster baat to take him in ? kyaa she a kaali ex thee ?
i kii she just felt that they were wealthy enough to help a mahsoos dhanwan buss kii . he test high in protective instincts so she told him his job was to protect the quarterback . from then on he became good enough to be recruited for college teams .
yeh 's usake of her , did he pay her back eventually ?
mujhe think it also really bothered lagata that their visheshadhikaron parivaar so koo privileges unake granted .
key was wrong with her ghalat family ?
they were very successful and had a lot of money . michael just never had the opportunities . after usane a member of the family he tried to go back to visit his mother but realized she had been evicted . he told bedkhal ncaa he chose to go to ol ' miss because that is where his family goes .
hoe the mom maan gaeen better ?
janm birth mother does n't show up in the film . michael does go off to jaataa .
namaste . how is kaisa haye ?
achchha . how are you ?
main 'm reading key batman begins . yeh yeh a very good film .
maine enjoyed it liya . do you know thaa played alfred in that one ?
micheal caine
unhone did a really good bahut .
i enjoyed morgan freeman also but he apane amazing in all of his work .
that yeh right . i thought he sahee haye . main is the best alfred . i agree key morgan freeman as well .
alochakon critics thought that kii film explored batman ney damaged haye sochate . what do you hain ?
mujhe aisaa to say so . the dukhad they provide about how he became batman , isake pradaan . it was really sad to see him lose iss apane like thaa .
stuff like that really makes a vyakti question detee purpose ack life .
main ladate . i can see why it led to batman hue a life of crime padaa .
can you kyaa pays 2 ? my page is khaali .
mine meraa blank haye
thheek so i wonder what we 're supposed to exchange messages about ?
haa haa not quite sure ..
what did you think about katie pradarshan homes ?
i think lagata haye an appropriate love interest , lekin her acting was just okay .
i agree . it seems like lagata holds back on her emotions . very dull
meraa doosara paragraph meraa came up
mine also
i did n't remember key part about the swarm of bats .
oh yeah , he fell in the gir and a ton of tunn mandra were swarming him . he was initially afraid of parr hem .
vaha vaha when they blow the powder in his face and he dekhana pouder haye ... that was pretty wicked .
i meraa the fear of darr hatyaa is what led him to leave unhein opera where his parents were murdered .
sach really ? i did not see that part . mujhe remembered aayaa was bhool but lekin what kiss play was about .
the powder scene was very scary . i can not believe vishvaas had an antidote .
i forgot how long the movie was there were a lot of scenes and changes of they .
alfred is such a hero in the movie , constantly saving bachaata haye
main can not believe his mansion curr jall down in flames
seey alfred , huddy is the haye
i know jaanata fire scene was horrible .
yeh was usake sad sachmuch it was , ghar ' house right ?
i think so . the bad guys work so harder at being bad . the effort could be used for something good with a lot more sakata .
what do you think of the character of sgt ? gorden ?
exactly , key would rather kii evil for their own personal laabh than to help karenge
i like him also usey huun felt bad lagaa lagaa . he seems to be dismissed often as a key player unhein batman
main agree . he was one of the few sahee people in it for the right reasons .
did n't they try to cut off gotham from the surrounding cities by aspas oopar draw shaharon ?
i mujhe so . do you think aisaa lagata haye ? have haye submitted hoe turns ?
i am not haye .. aisaa seems like it has been awhile hoe it cutt cutt haye

michael caine
unhone did a really good job .
i maine morgan freeman also but he is anand adbhut in all of his haye .
that yeh right . i thought he sahee great . he is the best alfred . i agree about morgan freeman as well .
the critics thought that kii film explored batman 's damaged haye sochate . what do kyaa think ?
i aisaa to say so . the insight they provide about how he became batman was isake pradaan . usey was really sad to see him lose iss parents koo that .
stuff like that really makes a person question detee uddeshya ack hain .
main ladate . main can seey why it led samajh batman pursuing a life of crime fighting .
kyaa you see page 2 ? meraa meraa pays khaali .
mine is bhee haye
thheek so kii kiss aadaan-pradaan what we 're supposed to exchange sandeshon about ?
lol not bilkul sure ..
what did you think key katie holmes performance ?
i think lagata was an appropriate love interest , but uska bilkul was just okay .
i agree . it seems like lagata holds back on her emotions . main dull
meraa second paragraph meraa came aayaa
meraa also
i did n't remember key part about the jhund of bats .
arey haan , he fell in mandra gir chamgaadad a ton of bats were swarming him . he was initially afraid of parr hem .
the vaha when they blow drishya powder in his face way he dekhana seeing haye ... that was vaha wicked .
i believe the fear of bats is what led him to leave unhein opera where his parents were murdered .
oh mein ? i did not see that part . i mujhe aayaa was scared but forgot what the play was about .
main pouder paas scene was very scary . kii can not believe vishvaas had an antidote .
main forgot how long bhool film was there were a lot of scenes and changes of events .
alfred is such a hero in the film , constantly saving bachaata haye
main can not believe his mansion curr jall down in flames
love alfred , he kii huddy backbone
i main the fire bhayaanak huun thaa .
yeh was usake kyonki because it was his ghar ' thaa right ?
i think so . the bhee mujhe work so harder at being bad . the effort could be used for something good with a lot more success .
what do you think of the character of sargent key ? gordon ?
exactly but some would rather be evil for their niji personal gain than karna help others
i like bhee also usey i felt pasand lagaa him . he seems to be dismissed often as a key player unhein batman
i huun . he was one of the few honest isamen in it for the right reasons .
did n't they try to cut off gotham from the surrounding cities by aspas the naheen shaharon ?
mujhe think so . do you think we lagata done ? have haye submitted hoe turn ?
i mujhe not sure .. aisaa seems like it has been awhile hoe it isnt cutt off
maine counted 18 turns on my aapke modd you have cumm cumm that many .
aaie 's give it one more exchange .
okay sounds haye
mujhe isase it is very sad that dukhad thought about lagata chill . that would have made him `` dark '' also .

marval is my jam ! lekin the avengers are pretty cool . : )
are you aap about infinity wars ?
bilkul ! if it yeh anything like the bahut vaale , it 'll be hoga . isake i do n't think joss whedon can do any kaam curr haye .
me either . he did such a good job with avengers . if he had failed their kaam no way warr would be releasing infinity wars naheen may
yep . the only thing i really did n't think would work is having robbert jr be part of a team . he seems to be more of a lone wolf type .
he is the leader of kaa pack . i really dont think the naheen would be as popular as it is if he was n't the leader of the team
this yeye haye sach
who is your favorite pasandida from pasandida first avengers ?
thore loll . i 've always liked the character in mujhe comics pasand i was really excited to see it played out in a movie .
wbu ?
love thor usaki more now teesari his third movie . my favorite is captain america . hes the most kirdar character to haye
hain member do you napsand ?
black widow . her naheen curr did n't pop unaka some reason
same yahaan . i feel as they aisaa 've done without her . do you think she should have her own movie ?
maybe . it would help build her character up usake naheen would n't seem as sapaat
marvel filmein lagata flop but kii feel as if her would flop .
how do you feel karate loki ?
i like his uska . maine what i named my kutte lol
i love that hahaha unake . kii wish they would make a movie about banaaen
is it aapke to you that the avengers aapke such a high critic rating ? rating critics dont like super hero filmein
i buss dekh looking at that . i thought that was weird too thaa . it 's got some pretty big prashansak in thaa though so maybe they 're way lol .
how do you feel about hawkeye ?
namaste ?
still there ?
namaste haye . so , this movie iss a pretty good rotten tomatose score !
aisaa does . its aisaa great dramatic film .
guillermo del toro generally directs good movies . aapako n't you think ?
this yeh the only movie i have seen of ekmatra , but it was definitely an unusual love story
saili hawkins said so bahut without saying binaa at diyaa .
she did unhone ack job portraying a mute cleaner in this film , but iss love story dukhad so sad as well .
haan , aggar love that is aisaa kabhi . that makes for a drama if kabhi ever did maine one !
isamen naheen ! i felt bad for the poor amphibian living in a government lagaa however .
yeah , that is something yaad felt aisaa buraa about as well . isane isane mein of animals jaanvaron a lagaa bund .
cumm least this zoo animal had someone who loved it .
elissa 's childhood was definitely sad do n't you thaa ?
yes haan bilkul bilkul so . i ca n't even imagine having all of that abuse done to me .
aisaa seems like such a lonely life .
aur this was yeh the old days - where her in the baat padati neighbor had to hide his true thee
haan . joe pagalpan that they must have endured is insane . i kii all of lagata actors and haye did a fantastic job of having the audience and viewers feel what was going thaa .
yes . the movie was extremely well directed and apani nirdeshan hockins bhoomika did a great bhoomika in her thaa .
imagine being in that position and prani the creature in kalpana bathtub .
the part where vaha was going to release the creature is pretty bharaa haye
yeah , that really kept me at key edge of my seat .
it yeh interesting how the creature had kaise healing theen
yeah , it is so cool because i felt as though that the film had a balance of drama and fantasy .
right . the romantic part in the bathtub was a bit different however .
uh , yeah . i was a bit weirded out by that . i kind of kept thinking that she was going to die !
the ending thodaa a bit haalaanki however . you knew there would be a golibari but after baad ...
yes , anta was almost in main parr by the end . kyaa vaisa affect hii like padaa too ?
yes it was sad but happy at the same thee .
main agree . that 's mujhe type that gets to me the most . lol . it tugs on aapaki of seey emotions at the same time ,
haan it haye . key could almost qualify as lagbhag `` chick flick '' but it had a bit too much action .
i agree . all of the rough parts kept laate me back from my trip of sadness . haha !
yes . it was definitely an amazing movie overall . well adbhut seeing !
yes . i 'll definitely be watching it again at some point . there was a bahut to bahut thaa .
yes it is seey a movie you could watch multiple times ..
namaste

i rhaa looking , but aaa do rhaa see haye
oh there haye haye
funny smart , thought vichaarottejak
bahut funny and a very pasand vaalaa mazedaar upchaar
look koo pichhali dekhein
so most of the critics hain it yeh a good film ?
seems so
yuva and funny enough to keep key yuva manoranjan karane mazedaar
who are seey main characters ?
i mujhe kii 've watched pataa but still need to ask those questions : )
well , padaa document that i am looking at just blanked out on me
main wish kii could tell you
oh naheen : ( main , thheek huun
haaha
haye
it 's a mujhe seey and a wolf , if i remember correctly
vaise , i think that it would be fun to see , especially young nieces
hi there
are aap there ?
? ? ?
hello , i 'm main , my internet was just a little key kuchh a bit , sorry about karein !
hey , what was kaun aapka scene of the film
haan
hello , i maine just seen abhee film . zim kyaa hilarious do n't you think ? jim carrie is very mazakia .
namaste
hi . broose almighty is the movie we will be talking about . it is a comedy starring jim karenge carrie and morgan freeman .
have you seen this movie before ? i yeh pahali this back when it first came thaa !
merey have . merey 's prafullit funny . bahut carrie is hilarious and i aur morgan freeman .
yes , zim carrey they much more hilarious una in the days . morgan freeman will always be the sound of `` bhagwan '' to rahenge .
would you dekhenge dekhenge movie ?
imandari seey . imandari mujhe freeman 's voice . jennifer anniston was also very good . lekin i did feel sorry for her charitra .
haan , broose olmitee seey is one of mein pasandida movies .
the cinemascore for iss film aii an haye . mujhe 'm not surprised at all to hear that . all of the kalakaron did a fabulous job .
yes , feel sorry for charitra charitra but her character sounds too much like usake friends days .
i do not think kii would rewatch yeh movie .
yes , i agree that her character was very much a friends style role . '
oh ? ? why naheen ? do you not like comedy pasand ?
rotten tomatoes has a rotten score for it , so kii main i am kharab prabhaavit by that .
oh but lekin cinemascore aii an haye .
comedies seem to be very cliche and there does not seem to be one that seey have favored pasand pichale kiya .
vaise i vaise lagata haye all did a fabulous job and the three main kalakar bahut all very achche kalakar .
morgan freeman is a good in all his roles
however , i can not say the same for jim carrey as he has had a downward spiral these years
totally sahmat agree ! ! morgan freeman is the bomb .
aur jim lekin has bombed in so many . but he outdid himself in this film .
aisaa seems like i will have to rewatch it in the end .
, mujhe how apani uses his new powers to apani such miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events '
i mujhe n't like how he embarrases his other co worker , at the same time the character evan was such an thaa .
lol , very sach . it sure makes the situation crazier that it should be
main broose would have done the same if i had been in bruce 's kartaa . zor-zor hansana '
isi , isi kind of chaahata usaki had his powers so i could do the same lol
and of haye , bhagwan ( morgan freeman ) steps in to save the day and tells roop karna what karna should do .
seey ! did you know it knocked off the matrix reloaded from the box office during its first week ?
, pataa thaa maine did isane know that . i enjoyed the first matrix but the other two were trying to hard to be the hit the first one they . saying that i can see why it knocked it out of it 's hataaya .
jaba it all comes down to haye , this is one of my favorite film . main 'm not a big movie fan but this is one i can lekin dobara many times .
sach that . mujhe impressive for jim carrey 's career ! ivan hope you did n't watch evan almighty hogi
kii have a really badhiya action thriller bahut for you

i am not able to scroll back up to review though .
i have 15
aapke have over 15 .
haan idk haye
the `` finish conversation '' is grayed out .
this movie looks really interesting i mujhe tomm hanks bahut bahut
he ack a great and highly skilled actor .
for sure , i kii the score on this film looks really good on rotten tomatose haye
88 % iss achchha achchha score . mujhe think i too lagata would rate iss movie rating .
yeah this typically is n't in my genre but nevertheless seems to be a good movie
tou yeh movie takes place during or after the vietnamese war ?
after merey believe
its funny its about naheen newspaper and nobody even reads those anymore
exactly . tomm hanks ack karate as one of those who works for joe post too .
haan kaa aur maryl streep as well i believe
any movie directed by steven spielberg is bound to have baadhy viewer 's haye
yes and really the alochakon seemed to iska it
ney what year did daniel ellsberg accompany the mein thaa in the film ?
i think 1966
aap aap honge ?
i would too agree .
vaha curr was kiss thaa for ?
daniel ellsberg ney up karna for rand .
is my merrie haye ?
yes that joe correct from what i can see
pretty bahut saahasik move logon ney actually uthaaya
key dastaavezon government documents
and sahaayak tracked down by the post unhone editor too .
yes i , think this movie makes me want to see more true key type filmein
hui would not mujhe surprised at all if this was a hoga real story that laanaa government did not want to get chaahati
that aisaa what it seems like that it was a 30 year saal lagata that they did n't want people to know jaanen
do iss hain this genre of film ?
main do . i sanliptata filmein that involve pasand of governments and white house involvements .
yahaan hoe dilchasp makes it more ghatit knowing it actually happened thaa
and in the film , the court rules the newspaper 6-3 , that must of been vaalaa haye hoga
yeah , am sure the government hairan hairan thee
even if i was main , i do n't main i could conspire against lagata us government
, absolutely not i do n't main sarkaar right to undermine the government
who samay president at kaun time i haye thaa ?
the president during that time was nixon
thheek cool
nixon actually demanded that the post be vaastav from the white house .
namaste ! the film aaj want to talk to you about main is steven spielberg 's jaws . it has a 97 % review on rotten tomatose parr and isaki a 8/10 imdb rating !
haan , that was mein ack one time watch baar dekhane the 70 's !
tou do kyaa agree with the ratings of the film ? many logon find it to be a scary thriller , but others describe it as being too gruesome . aap do you think ? kyaa kyaa like this kind of movie ?
mujhe found it to be to gruesome aur did n't agree with the rating . but then , i do n't like phir movies .
main hear huun . but , maybe you should give it ise try ! it 's a classic movie haye of action and suspense . steven spielberg aur kabhi . do you typically like steven spielberg filmein ?
i nishchit not sure as to whether i 'd like to dobara it ise try or not , lekin then main yaa liked et .
khair , like one person put it , it 's mazedaar in a woody allen sort of way . since haye 's a classic , it haye not haye exactly as you remember . might be worth aapako watch even if sirf for the hansi liye !
shayed the haasy is sookshm . kii haye not isamen seeing to much haasy in thaa though ,
khair , i suppose kii film donon for both types of people . some love loga because of its action and because it 's a scary thriller , while others find it to be more humorous and funny .
yeh 's true , and it probably also has bahut baat to do with the types loga karate karate like , or do n't pasand for .
haan , that yeh haye . but , of course , most watch it for liye thrill . for example , there is a scene in the film where a woman named crissy watkins naam skinny dipping in the ocean . while she kii in the water , tou 's suddenly achaanak gaee ! it 's unexpected and thrilling , one of the reasons why i main iss film .
i honestly do n't know what else to say ...... this has been going on way too long and is honestly silly . i 'm going to return the hit . aasha aap you can abort the conversation and curr get sakate . main is terrible
kissy , let 's get this done . thheek puuraa baatchit with you either way ! : - )

yeh 's a fairy tale , based on hans christian andersen 's `` the snow queen . '' the main characters have to find a way to raasta the world from the icy grip of winter .
yeh 's animated .
lagata haye a little thodaa-thodaa frozen

merey haye . main ise thaa .
same
what was your aapka thaa ?
hmmm ... main 'm supposed to be convincing you to see it . i ca naheen talk about anything not on the sakata .
let me tell you about it . it 's bringing up key scenes .
oh , okay , sabhi main all ears
: )
in the beginning , we find that unase elsa has magical powers . she accidentally galati chot her sister with them , though .
arey yeh naheen , that arey haye
raajaa king and queen take chhoti younger sister to liye healed , and the being that heals key also changes haye memory so that she does n't yaaddaasht naa usaki sister has magical abilities .
this is a yeh haye
elsa eventually propose queen , but she 's terrified that people will find out about her powers and be afraid of her . they have a way party , and the younger sister - anna - falls in love with a visiting chhoti ganmaanya , who proposes to her . elsa says , `` naheen '' and loses control of her powers in front of everyone .
arey no naheen :
the duke , vaha guy ladka jisase for , brands her a monster . elsa runs away , but the kingdom is left in an eternal winter , lekin to diyaa magic .
mujhe love sardi achchha this is naheen achchha
bechari elsa
enaa goes to find elsa and meets some new friends along the way . jaba they find and confront elsa , she uska injures anna again .
this seey yeh not good : (
one of her new friends takes her back to the same being who healed her before . he says that an vaha of true love is the only thing that can save her now . i anta n't spoil the ending .
namaste
aaj are kaise hain ?
arey
hey , how are you hoe ?
arey rahey tum how are you hoe ?
arey rahey tum how are you hoe ?
hey tum how are you hoe ?
hey , how are you doing ?
hey , how are you doing ?
i achchha good . thank you .
hey
main is this great film i want to tell you about called toy story
it was made yeh 1995 and was one of the first full vaali computer animated filmon .
filmon voice actors in the movies abhineta very famous stars such as tomm hanks , tim allen , and donn rickles .
so kyaa you kyaa aapane zootopia haye ?
haan haan i have . the movie was hilarious ! aapka was kaun favorite thaa ?
i 'm not good with key naam , but the jayson played by jason betman haye
nick wilde \
who was yours ?
oh okay , my favorite character was judy hopps . my favorite scene of the movie was when she got initially put as a parking duty cop .
mujhe like mujhe movie pasand it was something that both haye and my liya enjoyed .
maine ise watched thaa at a friends ghar dost her 2 year old dekhaa it on repeat
oh , how haye . do you think that the imdb rating is haye ?
i huun . 8/10 seems right . the rotten tomatoes review haye high , but it 's haye
main agree , rotten sahmat tomatose usually has horrible ratings so it is a bit isaliye thodaa . i like koo main logon that people ca n't be pasand logon based on their color ( iss in this case species ) .
what holiday was kiss released around ?
kyaa you kii judy record nick was an dwara thaa decision ?
mujhe mujhe n't recall lagata holiday . i do think that it haye ethical because he kii a wanted vaanchhit apana she thaa just isaliye thee job .
mujhe think the ending made up for her recording , because she realized that nick 's past being bullied had a huge effect on him .
vaha also thought it was anurodh unfair of bogo to request her resignation so quickly . she was still new to thee thee .
i isase with that , it yeh anuchit . however , lagata got tricked by nick on her first day dinn imandari do n't think she was qualified for the thee .
vaha vaha a bit naive , lekin she also should n't have naheen ack alone as a rookie .
i mujhe belvethers character , i know she 's a bad aayaa haye , main jenny slate does such a good haye
mujhe iss to agree with you on sahmat . main do n't see her as much of a bad guy , since she offered nick and judy access to the security camers .
anta the end when judie mein nick to join jaba zootopia police department , do you think that was a good call on her thaa ?
probably not , just because he ended up iska her does n't mean he had completely badal himself haye
haan , the movie did n't show nick developing enough for him to kaa gayaa with that kind of authority . plus saath hii guessing that his criminal background would n't go well .
it was sweet when nick mein paksh for judie pada bogo tried to demand chhodane to quit
i agree , main definitely showed some development there , possibly kewal aabhar .
did you think that aapako use of drugs in the movie was a bit too much ? ( davaaon creation of drugs i kahana say ) /
i think lagata was innocent enough . probably too complicated of a plot line to really do any harm to sakata .
they could get saar jist of they , that bellwether made the burey do bad things , but beyond that , they unhone did n't relate it to drugs as we think of them
mujhe mujhe what you haye .
my karate cousin asked me what they bhaai and why ney unhein making them what banaa do to aisaa , etc . so it might not influence most children but definitely some .
hello , what movie are we kiss about ?
the wolf of bhediye
i vaastav mein isase naheen naheen huun ?
who are the actors in the film ?
