Now it is the way he markets ads by listening through the phones	abb yeh vaha tarika haye jisase vaha phone key madhyam seey vigyaapan sunkar vigyaapan bechata haye	now ye uska tarika tha jisme wo market me add karta hai phone par sun kar

Mujhe Freeman's ki voice pasand hai. Jennifer Anniston bhi bahut acchi thi. But mujhe unke character ke liye khed hai.
Yes, Bruce Almighty is one of my go-to movies.	haan, broose olmitee merrie pasandida filmon mein seey ack haye.	Yes, Bruce almighty meri go-to movies me se ek hai.
The cinemascore for this movie is an A.  I'm not surprised at all to hear that.  All of the actors did a fabulous job.	iss film kaa cinemascore aii haye. mujhe yeh sunkar bilkul bhee ashcharya naheen huaa.  sabhi kalakaron ney shandar kaam kiya.	Is moive ka cinemascore A hai. Mujhe se sun kar koi surprise nahi hua. Sabhi actors ne fabulous kaam kiya hai.
Yes I feel sorry for her character but her character sounds too much like her Friends days.	haan, mujhe usake charitra parr dayaa aatee haye, lekin uska charitra usake friends days jaisa lagata haye.	Yes mujhe unke character ke liye khed hai par unha character bahut kuch Freinds days ki tarah tha.

Well I think the actors all did a fabulous job and the three main actors are all very good actors.	vaise mujhe lagata haye kii sabhi kalakaron ney shandar kaam kiya haye aur teenon mukhya kalakar bahut achche kalakar hain.	Mujhe lagta he ke sabhi actor achcha acting kiya hai lekin tin main actors bahot hi achcha kiya hai
Morgan Freeman is a good in all his roles	morgan freeman apani sabhi bhoomikaon mein achche hain	Morgan Freeman sob roles bahot hi achcha karta hai
However, I cannot say the same for Jim Carrey as he has had a downward spiral these years	haalaanki, main zim carrie key liye aisaa naheen kaha sakata kyonki inn varshon mein unaka patan huaa haye	Jim Carrey ke bareme hum ye abhi kehe nehi sakte kiu ke is sal pe wo achha nehi kiya
Totally totally agree!!  Morgan Freeman is the bomb.	purnataya sahmat!!  morgan freeman bumm haye.	Hum bhi tumse pura agree kartehe ke Morgan Freeman bomb hai
And Jim Carrey has bombed in so many.  But he outdid himself in this movie.	aur zim carrie ney bahuton parr bambari kii haye.  lekin iss film mein unhone khud koo maat dey dee.	aur jim carrey ne kahi saare bombed kiya.. lekin voh usske outdid apne movie mein di

I don't like how he embarrases his other co worker but at the same time the character Evan was such an ass.	mujhe yeh pasand naheen haye kii vaha apane dusare sahakarmi koo kaise sharminda kartaa haye, lekin saath hii ivan kaa kirdar bahut hii gadhaa thaa.	muje pasand nahi kyon ki voh itna embarrases huva apni co worker ke saath aur same time us evan ka character tho bakvas tha
Lol, very true.  It sure makes the situation crazier that it should be	loll, bilkul sach.  yeh nishchit roop seey sthiti koo aur adhik vichitra banaa detaa haye jaisa kii honah chaahiye	lol, sach hein yar, isse tho aur crazier ban jaatha is situation ko
I probably would have done the same if I had been in Bruce's situation. LOL'	aggar main broose kii sthiti mein hotaa tou shayed main bhee aisaa hii kartaa. zor-zor seey hansana'	mein bhi aise hi kartha is bruce ka situation ko lol

And of course, God  (Morgan Freeman) steps in to save the day and tells Bruce what he should do.	aur nishchit roop seey, bhagwan (morgan freeman) sthiti koo bachaane key liye aage aataa haye aur broose koo bataata haye kii usey kyaa karna chaahiye.	ofcourse, God yaani morgan freeman ne apna din ko save kara aur bruce ko bola

Yes, it is definitely implied. There is a lot of symbolism and allegory in the film.	haan, yeh avashya nihit haye. film mein prateekatmakta aur roopak kii bharmar haye.	Han, ye implied hai. is film me kafi symbolism and allegory hai.
They are like slashes from a knife..., kinda mirroring the gills of the amphibian creature.	way chaku seey kaate gaye tukadon kii tarah hain..., ubhayachar prani key galfadon koo pratibimbit karate hue.	Wo knife ke slashes ki tarah hai..., jaise amphibian creature ke gills ko mirror kar raha ho.
That is highly curious, could you describe some film scenes?	yeh behad utsuktapurna haye, kyaa aap kuchh filmi drishyon kaa varnan curr sakate hain?	ye kafi curious hai, kya tum kuch film scenes describe kar sakte ho?
Sure. Elisa (main character ) keeps the creature in her bathtub, with salts.

Sure. Elisa (main character ) creature ko bathtub mein rakhti hai, salts ke saath. Wo out of water zyada der nahi reh sakta.

Yes, Jim Carrey was much more hilarious back in the days.  Morgan Freeman will always be the sound of "God" to me.	haan, zim carrie una dinon bahut adhik prafullit they.  morgan freeman merey liye hamesha "bhagwan" kii aavaaz rahenge.	Han, un dino mein Jim Carrey zyada hilarious tha. Morgan Freeman mere liye hamesha sound of "God" rahega
Would you rewatch the movie?	kyaa aap film dobara dekhenge?	kya tum is movie ko dobara dekhoge?
Honestly.  I love Freeman's voice.  Jennifer Anniston was also very good.  But I did feel sorry for her character.	imandari seey. mujhe freeman kii aavaaz bahut pasand haye. jennifer aniston bhee bahut achchi theen. lekin mujhe usake charitra parr afsos huaa.	Honestly, main Freeman ki voice ko pasand karta hun. Jeniffer Anniston bhi kafi achi thi. Par main uske character ke liye sorry feel karta hun.
Yes, Bruce Almighty is one of my go-to movies.	haan, broose olmitee merrie pasandida filmon mein seey ack haye.	Yes, Bruce Almighty meri go-to movies mein se ek hai.
The cinemascore for this movie is an A.  I'm not surprised at all to hear that.  All of the actors did a fabulous job.	iss film kaa cinemascore aii haye. mujhe yeh sunkar bilkul bhee ashcharya naheen huaa.  sabhi kalakaron ney shandar kaam kiya.	Is movie ka cinemascore A hai. Main bilkul bhi surprsied nahi hun ye hear kar ke. Sabhi actors ne fabulous kaam kia.
Yes I feel sorry for her character but her character sounds too much like her Friends days.	haan, mujhe usake charitra parr dayaa aatee haye, lekin uska charitra usake friends days jaisa lagata haye.	Haan main uske character ke liye sorry feel karta hu par uska character kafi zyada uske Friends days se milta julta hai.
I do not think I would rewatch this movie.	mujhe naheen lagata kii main yeh film dobara dekhunga.	I don't think main woh movie phir se dekhunga
Yes, I agree that her character was very much a Friends style role. '	haan, main iss baat seey sahmat huun kii unaka kirdar kaafee hudd taka friends style kaa kirdar thaa. '	Yes, I agree  uska character bohot kuch friends style wala role tha
Oh??  Why not?  Do you not like comedies?	oh??  kyon naheen?  kyaa aapako comedy pasand naheen haye?	Oh?? Why not? Tumhe comedies pasand nahi?
Rotten Tomatoes has a rotten score for it, so I think i am swayed by that.	rotten tomatose key paas isake liye ack kharab score haye, isaliye mujhe lagata haye kii main usase prabhaavit huun.	Rotten Tomatoes main uska rotten score hi tha, so I think i am swayed by that.
Oh but the CinemaScore is an A.	oh, lekin cinemascore aii haye.	Oh lekin CinemaScore  A hai uska.
Comedies seem to be very cliche and there does not seem to be one that I have favored in awhile.	comedy bahut ghisi-pitty lagati haye aur aisee koee comedy naheen haye jise maine pichale kuchh samay seey pasand kiya hoe.	Comedies bahut cliche lagti hain aur aisi koi bhi nahi dikhti that I have favored in awhile.
Well I think the actors all did a fabulous job and the three main actors are all very good actors.	vaise mujhe lagata haye kii sabhi kalakaron ney shandar kaam kiya haye aur teenon mukhya kalakar bahut achche kalakar hain.	Well mujhe lagta hai saare actors ne fabulous kaam kiya and the three main actors are all very good actors.
Morgan Freeman is a good in all his roles	morgan freeman apani sabhi bhoomikaon mein achche hain	Morgan Freeman apne saare roles mein badhiya hai.
However, I cannot say the same for Jim Carrey as he has had a downward spiral these years	haalaanki, main zim carrie key liye aisaa naheen kaha sakata kyonki inn varshon mein unaka patan huaa haye	However, main Jim Carrey ke baare mein aisa nahi bol sakta kyunki he has had a downward spiral these years
Totally totally agree!!  Morgan Freeman is the bomb.	purnataya sahmat!!  morgan freeman bumm haye.	Totally agree!! Morgan Freeman to bomb hai.
And Jim Carrey has bombed in so many.  But he outdid himself in this movie.	aur zim carrie ney bahuton parr bambari kii haye.  lekin iss film mein unhone khud koo maat dey dee.	arey jim carrey ne tho kahi bar bombed kiya.. lekin usse movie mein nahi nazar aaya/.
It seems like I will have to rewatch it in the end.	aisaa lagata haye kii anta mein mujhe ise dobara dekhana padegaa.	muje lagtha hein ki muje end ko fir dekhna chahiye
I like how he uses his new powers to cause such miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events'	mujhe yeh pasand haye kii kaise vaha apani naee shaktiyon kaa upayog karke aisee chamatkari ghatnaaon koo ghatit kartaa haye, anyatha samanya ghatnaaon mein bhee.'	muje tho uska new powers ka usage bahut pasand aaya jaisa usne us miraculous events ko occur kiya
I don't like how he embarrases his other co worker but at the same time the character Evan was such an ass.	mujhe yeh pasand naheen haye kii vaha apane dusare sahakarmi koo kaise sharminda kartaa haye, lekin saath hii ivan kaa kirdar bahut hii gadhaa thaa.	muje pasand nahi hein yar kaise voh embarrasses huva apne coworker ke saath.. aur evan ka character tho bakvas hein.
Lol, very true.  It sure makes the situation crazier that it should be	loll, bilkul sach.  yeh nishchit roop seey sthiti koo aur adhik vichitra banaa detaa haye jaisa kii honah chaahiye	lol, sach hein. isse aur crazier ban jaatha is situation ko
I probably would have done the same if I had been in Bruce's situation. LOL'	aggar main broose kii sthiti mein hotaa tou shayed main bhee aisaa hii kartaa. zor-zor seey hansana'	mein bhi aise hi kartha agar mein bruce ka situation hota lol
Likewise, I kind of wish I had his powers so I could do the same lol	isi tarah, main chaahata huun kii merey paas bhee usaki shaktiyan houn taaki main bhee vaisa hii curr sakoon	agar muje powers miltha tho mein bhi aise hi kartha lol
And of course, God  (Morgan Freeman) steps in to save the day and tells Bruce what he should do.	aur nishchit roop seey, bhagwan (morgan freeman) sthiti koo bachaane key liye aage aataa haye aur broose koo bataata haye kii usey kyaa karna chaahiye.	aur us morgan freeman tho god bankar bruce ka day save kiya aur usse uska kaam nikal vaaya

Noooo I didn't know that.  I enjoyed the first Matrix but the other two were trying to hard to be the  hit the first one was.  Saying that I can see why it knocked it out of it's place.	naheen, mujhe yeh naheen pataa thaa.  maine pahale matricks kaa anand liya lekin anya dou pahale vaale kii tarah hitt honey key liye kadee mehnat curr rahey they.  yeh kahate hue kii main dekh sakata huun kii isane ise apani jagah seey kyon hataaya.	nahi muje nahi patha.. lekin mein first matrix ko enjoy kar raha tha lekin donon aapas mein hit kar rahe thei.. dono us place ke liye knocked out kar rahe they
When it all comes down to it, this is one of my favorite movies.  I'm not a big movie fan but this is one I can rewatch many times.	jaba yeh sub saamane aataa haye, tou yeh merrie pasandida filmon mein seey ack haye.  main bahut badee film kaa prashansak naheen huun lekin yeh aisee film haye jise main kaee baar dobara dekh sakata huun.	jab sab kuch is par hi aa jata hai, yah meri favorite movie me se hai, mai big movies ka fan nahi hu but ye wali me kai baar dekh sakta hu.

Hi! The movie I want to talk to you about today is Steven Spielberg's JAWS. It has a 97% review on Rotten Tomatoes and has a 8/10 IMDB rating!	namaste! aaj main jiss film key baare mein aapse baat karna chaahata huun vaha steven spielberg kii jaws haye. rotten tomatose parr isaki 97% sameeksha haye aur isaki imdb rating 8/10 haye!	namaste! aaj main jis philm ke baare mein aapase baat karana chaahata hoon vah hai steven spielberg kee jaws
Yes, that was worth a one time watch back in the 70's!	haan, 70 key dashak mein yeh ack baar dekhane laayak thaa!	haan, yah 70 ke dashak mein ek baar dekhane laayak tha!
So do you agree with the ratings of the movie? Many people find it to be a scary thriller, but others describe it as being too gruesome. What do you think? Do you like this kind of movie?	tou kyaa aap film kii rating seey sahmat hain? kaee logon koo yeh ack daravani thriller lagati haye, lekin anya loga ise bahut bhayaanak bataate hain. aap kyaa sochate hain? kyaa aapako iss tarah kii film pasand haye?	to kya aap philm kee reting se sahamat hain? kaee logon ko yah ek daraavana thrilar lagata hai, lekin any log ise bheeshan bataate hain. tum kya sochate ho? kya aapako is tarah kee philm pasand hai?
I found it to be to gruesome and didn't agree with the rating.  But then, I don't like violent movies.	mujhe yeh bahut bhayaanak lagaa aur main rating seey sahmat naheen thaa.  lekin phir bhee, mujhe hinsak filmein pasand naheen hain.	I found it to be to gruesome  aur reting se sahamat nahin tha. lekin phir, mujhe hinsak philmen pasand nahin hain.
I hear ya. But, maybe you should give it another try! It's a classic movie full of action and suspense. Steven Spielberg never disappoints. Do you typically like Steven Spielberg movies?	main aapaki baat sunata huun. lekin, shayed aapako ise dobara aazamaana chaahiye! yeh action aur suspense seey bharpur ack classic film haye. steven spielberg kabhi nirash naheen karate. kyaa aapako aamtaur parr steven spielberg kii filmein pasand hain?	main aapakee baat sunata hoon.lekin, shaayad aapako ise ek aur koshish denee chaahie! yah ekshan aur saspens se bharapoor klaasik philm hai. steven spielberg kabhee niraash nahin karate.kya aap aamataur par steevan speelabarg philmen pasand karate hain?
I'm not sure as to whether I'd like to give it another try or not,  but then again I liked ET.	main nishchit naheen huun kii main ise dobara aazamaana chahunga yaa naheen, lekin phir bhee mujhe eaty pasand aayaa.	mujhe yakeen nahin hai ki kya main ise ek aur koshish dena chaahoonga ya nahin, lekin phir mujhe eetee pasand aaya.
Well, like one person put it, it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way. Since it's a classic, it might not be exactly as you remember. Might be worth the watch even if just for the laughs!	khair, jaisa kii ack vyakti ney kahaa, yeh woody ellen kii tarah mazedaar haye. choonki yeh ack classic haye, isaliye hoe sakata haye kii yeh bilkul vaisa naa hoe jaisa aapako yaad haye. dekhane laayak hoe sakata haye, bhale hii sirf hansi key liye!	khair, jaise ek vyakti ne ise rakha, yah ek tarah se vudee elan kee tarah mazedaar hai.choonki yah ek klaasik hai, yah theek vaisa nahin ho sakata jaisa aap yaad karate hain. bhale hee sirph hansee ke lie ghadee dekhane laayak ho!
Perhaps the humor is subtle.  I recall not really seeing to much humor in it though,	shayed haasy sookshm haye.  haalaanki, mujhe yaad haye kii isamen vaastav mein bahut adhik haasy naheen dikh rhaa thaa,	shaayad haasy sookshm hai. mujhe yaad hai ki vaastav mein isamen jyaada haasy dekhane ko nahin mila
Well, I suppose the film works for both types of people. Some love it because of its action and because it's a scary thriller, while others find it to be more humorous and funny.	khair, meraa maanana ​​haye kii film donon tarah key logon key liye kaam karati haye. kuchh loga ise isake action aur ack daravani thriller key kaaran pasand karate hain, jabaki anya ise adhik haasyaprad aur majedar maanate hain.	khair, mujhe lagata hai ki philm donon tarah ke logon ke lie kaam karatee hai. kuchh ko isake ekshan se pyaar hai aur kyonki yah ek daraavana thrilar hai, jabaki any ise adhik vinodee aur majaakiya samajhate hain.
That's true, and it probably also has a lot to do with the types of humor people like, or don't care for.	yeh sach haye, aur iska shayed iss baat seey bhee bahut lena-denaa haye kii loga kiss prakaar key haasy koo pasand karate hain, yaa usaki parwah naheen karate hain.	yah sach hai, aur shaayad yah bhee haasy ke prakaar ke logon ke saath bahut kuchh karana hai, ya paravaah nahin hai.
Yeah, that's true. But, of course, most watch it for the thrill. For example, there is a scene in the movie where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While she's in the water, she's suddenly pulled under! It's unexpected and thrilling, one of the reasons why I enjoy this movie.	haan, yeh sahee haye. lekin, nihsandeh, adhikansh loga ise romanch key liye dekhate hain. udaaharan key liye, film mein ack drishya haye jahaan crissy watkins naam kii ack mahila samudra mein dubki lagaati haye. jaba vaha paani mein thee, tou vaha achaanak neeche kheench lii gaee! yeh apratyaashit aur romanchkari haye, yahee ack kaaran haye kii main iss film kaa anand letaa huun.	haan voh sach hein. par jyada log us thrill ke liye dekhenge. udharan, voh movie me yek scene yek aurat uska naam chrissie watkins skinny dipping karthi thi ocean mein. jab voh pani mein hein, achanak use upper pull kar the hein, voh toh unexpected aur thrill bhi hein, muje toh us movie dekhkar badi kushi huvi.
I honestly don't know what else to say...... This has been going on way too long and is honestly silly. I'm going to return the HIT. Hopefully you can abort the conversation and still get paid. This is terrible	main imandari seey naheen jaanata kii aur kyaa kahuun...... yeh bahut lambe samay seey chala rhaa haye aur imandari seey murkhtapurna haye. main hitt vaapas karane jaa rhaa huun. aasha haye kii aap baatchit koo samaapt curr sakate hain aur phir bhee bhugtan praapt curr sakate hain. yeh bhayaanak haye	muje kuch patha nahi ab vaakahi mein mein kya kahun... voh toh bahut long ja raha hein , aur voh silly bhi hein. mein toh return karne vala hoon us hit ko. isse aapka conversation abort hoga magar aapko paid bhi hoga. voh terrible hein yar
Ok, let's get this done.  Nice chatting with you either way!  :-)	thheek haye, chalo ise puuraa curr lein.  kissy bhee tarah seey aapke saath baatchit karke achchha lagaa!  :-)	acha ab mein chala. aapse chat karne se muje kushi hein
What is the movie about?	film kiss baare mein haye?	movie kis baare me hai?

Did they abandon him on purpose?	kyaa unhone jaanboojhkar usey chhod diyaa?	Kya wo jaan bhuj k abandon karte hai?
no they had lost track of him since they had multiple family's over for christmas	naheen, kyonki chrismus key liye unake parivaar key kaee loga aaye hue they, isaliye unhone uska pataa naheen lagaaya thaa	nahi, wo uska track lose kardete hai kyuki bahut saari family christmas k liye aayi thi.
Did they realize they lost track of him and come back for him?	kyaa unhein ehsas huaa kii way uska pataa khou chuke hain aur usake liye vaapas aaye hain?	Kya wo realize karte hai k wo chhut gaya aur uske liye wapas aate hai?
Kevin's mother realizes that he is lost once they arrive at their destination and she trys to get on a flight back home but there are none available so she drives back with strangers	apane gantavya parr pahunchane key baad cavin kii maan koo ehsas hotaa haye kii vaha khou gayaa haye aur vaha ghar vaapas jaane key liye flight pakadane kii koshish karati haye lekin koee flight upalabdh naheen hoti isaliye vaha ajnabiyon key saath vaapas chully jaati haye.

Oh, ok. Is he able to fend for himself at all?	oh thheek. kyaa vaha apani suraksha swayam karane mein saksham haye?	Oh, thik hai. Jya wo apne liye thoda bhi fend karne mein able tha?
kevin is left home because a power outage caused the family to oversleep and be late for their flight so in the confusion they misplaced kevin as he was sent to the attic for misbehaving the night before	cavin koo ghar chhod diyaa gayaa kyonki bijli katauti key kaaran parivaar koo neend aaa gaee aur unaki udaan key liye dair hoe gaee, isaliye bhram mein unhone cavin koo khou diyaa kyonki usey pichhali raat durvyavahaar karane key kaaran attari mein bhej diyaa gayaa thaa.	kevin ghar par reh jata hai kyunki power outage ki wajeh se family oversleep kar leti hai aur flight ke liye late ho jati hai to confusion me wo kevin ko misplace kar dete hain kyunki usey pichli raat ko attic mein bheja tha misbehave karne ke liye.
So, he is not able to fend for himself?  Is he afraid?	tou kyaa vaha apani suraksha khud karane mein saksham naheen haye?  kyaa vaha dartaa haye?	to kya wo apne liye fend nahi kar patha? kya wo afraid hai?
he enjoys being alone but he is met with two burglers who he has to try and strop	vaha akele rehna pasand kartaa haye lekin usaki mulakat dou choron seey hoti haye jinhen rokane kii usey koshish karni padati haye	wo ghar par akela rehna pasand karta hai par usey do burglars milte hai jisey usko rokne ki koshish karni hai

I'm not good with character names, but the fox played by jason bateman	main kirdaaron key naam key mamle mein achchha naheen huun, lekin lomdi kaa kirdar jayson betman ney nibhaaya haye	muje character names kuch yaad nahi hein lakin fox ka role toh jason bateman ne kiya tha
Nick Wilde \	nick wild \	nick wilde
Who was yours?	tumhara kaun thaa?	aapka konsa
Oh okay, my favorite character was Judy Hopps. My favorite scene of the movie was when she got initially put as a parking duty cop.	oh thheek haye, meraa pasandida kirdar judie hops thaa. film kaa meraa pasandida drishya vaha thaa jaba usey shuruat mein parking duty puliskarmi key roop mein rakhaa gayaa thaa.	acha, mera favorite character toh judy hoops hein. mera favorite scene is movie mein toh jab voh uska duty cop apni parking se shuru ki
I like the movie because it was something that both me and my children enjoyed.	mujhe film pasand haye kyonki yeh kuchh aisee thee jiska maine aur merey bachchon donon ney anand liya.	muje is movie pasand hein kyon ki mein aur mera bachon bahut enjoy kiye hein
I actually watched it at a friends house because her 2 year old had it on repeat	maine vaastav mein ise ack dost key ghar parr dekhaa thaa kyonki usake 2 saal key bachche ney bhee ise dohraya thaa	mein toh apni doston ke saath dekha kyon ki uska 2 saal beta ko fir se dekhne ka man kiya
Oh, how funny. Do you think that the IMDB rating is appropriate?	oh, kitna ajib haye. kyaa aapako lagata haye kii imdb rating uchit haye?	acha kitna funny hein, kya aapko laga ki IMDB ka rating appropriate hota hein?
I do. 8/10 seems right. The Rotten Tomatoes review seems high, but it's impressive	main kartaa huun. 8/10 sahee lagata haye. rotten tomatose kii sameeksha oonchi lagati haye, lekin yeh prabhaavshaali haye	haan yar, 8/10 toh right hi hota. Rotten Tomatoes ka review bhi high hota muje pasand hein
I agree, Rotten Tomatoes usually has horrible ratings so it is a bit surprising. I like the main theme that people can't be judged based on their color (well in this case species).	main sahmat huun, rotten tomatose kii rating aamtaur parr bhayaanak hoti haye isaliye yeh thodaa aashcharyajanak haye. mujhe mukhya vishay yeh pasand haye kii logon koo unake rung (iss mamle mein prajaati) key aadhar parr naheen aanka jaa sakata.	yeh sahi baat hai ki rotten tomatoes ki ratings kharab hoti hai usually, isiliye yeh todha surprising hai. Mujhe main theme acchi kagi jaha log judge nahi kiye ja rahe apne rang k liye. ( kam se kam is case species me)
What Holiday was this released around?	yeh kiss avkash key aspas jaari kiya gayaa thaa?	kis chutti k aap pass yeh release hui tha?
Do you think Judy recording Nick was an ethical decision?	kyaa aapako lagata haye kii judie dwara nick koo record karna ack naitik nirnay thaa?	kya tumhe lagta ki judy ne Nick ko jo record kia wo ethical tha?
I don't recall the holiday. I do think that it was ethical because he was a wanted suspect so she was just doing her job.	mujhe chhuttiyaan yaad naheen hain. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh naitik thaa kyonki vaha ack vaanchhit sandigdh thaa isaliye vaha sirf apana kaam curr rahee thee.	Mujhe holiday yaad nahi. Par mujhe yeh zarur lagta ki yeh ethical tha kyuki wo ek wanted suspect tha aur wo sirf apna kaam kar rahi thi
I think the ending made up for her recording, because she realized that Nick's past being bullied had a huge effect on him.	mujhe lagata haye kii anta usaki recording key liye banaa, kyonki usey ehsas huaa kii nick koo ateet mein dhamakaae jaane kaa usa parr bahut badaa prabhaav padaa thaa.	mujhe lagta hai jo ending thi usne sab sahi kar dia kyuki usko realize hua ki Nick ki past me jo bulling hui wo uspar kaafi effect ki hai
I also thought it was super unfair of Bogo to request her resignation so quickly. She was still new to the force.	maine yeh bhee socha kii bogo dwara itani jaldi istife kaa anurodh karna behad anuchit thaa. vaha abhee bhee bull mein naee thee.	mujhe yeh bhi laga ki yeh bohot unfair tha jo bogo ne usse resignation maanga kyu wo abhi nayi thi force me
I agree with that, it was unfair. However, she got tricked by Nick on her first day I honestly don't think she was qualified for the position.	main isase sahmat huun, yeh anuchit thaa. haalaanki, pahale hii dinn usey nick ney dhokha dey diyaa, imandari seey kahuun tou mujhe naheen lagata kii vaha iss pada key liye yogya thee.	mujhe bhi yeh baat sahi lagi, wo nayi thi.  halaki, wo pehle din hi Nick se trick ho gayi, wo is position k liye qualified hi nahi thi
She was a bit naive, but she also shouldn't have been out alone as a rookie.	vaha thodi nadan thee, lekin ack nausikhiya key roop mein usey bhee akele baahar naheen jaanaa chaahiye thaa.	wo todhi pagal thi, magar use akele aise rookie par nahi jana tha
I loved Bellwethers character, I know she's a bad guy, but Jenny Slate does such a good job	mujhe belvethers kaa kirdar bahut pasand aayaa, main jaanata huun kii vaha ack buraa aadami haye, lekin jenny slate bahut achchha kaam karati haye	mujhe Bellwethers ka character sabse mast laga, mujhe pata hai wo buri thi usme magar Jenny Slate ne bohot accha kaam kia
I have to agree with you on that. I don't see her as much of a bad guy, since she offered Nick and Judy access to the security cameras.	mujhe iss parr aapse sahmat honah hoga. main usey burey aadami key roop mein naheen dekhta, kyonki usane nick aur judie koo suraksha camers taka pahunch kii peshkash kii thee.	Mai tumse sehmat hu ispar. Mujhe wo itni buri bhi nahi lagi kyuki usne Nick aur Judy ko security camera ka access dia.
In the end when Judy asked Nick to join the Zootopia police department, do you think that was a good call on her part?	anta mein jaba judie ney nick koo zootopia pulis vibhaag mein shamil honey key liye kahaa, tou kyaa aapako lagata haye kii yeh usaki or seey ack achchha ahwan thaa?	end mein jab judy ne Nick se Zootopia police department ko join karne kaha tha, toh kya aap isse ache call kahe jaayenge?
Probably not, just because he ended up liking her doesn't mean he had completely turned himself around	shayed naheen, sirf isaliye kii vaha usey pasand karane lagaa iska matlab yeh naheen haye kii usane khud koo poori tarah seey badal liya haye	bilkul nahi yar, kyon ki end mein usne pyar toh kiya lekin uska pura nahi usse diya
Yeah, the movie didn't show Nick developing enough for him to be trusted with that kind of authority. Plus I am guessing that his criminal background wouldn't go well.	haan, film mein nick koo itna vikasit naheen dikhaaya gayaa kii usa parr usa tarah key adhikaar kaa bharosa kiya jaa sakey. saath hii main anuman lagaa rhaa huun kii usaki aaparaadhik prishthabhoomi achchi naheen rahegi.	haan, is movie mein toh nick neh uska trust aur authority nahi develop ki. aur muje guess hein ki voh criminal background mein jarur nahi aayega
It was sweet when Nick stuck up for Judy when BOGO tried to demand her to quit	yeh madhur thaa jaba nick judie key paksh mein arh gaye jaba bogo ney unase pada chhodane kii maang karane kii koshish kii	voh toh pyara tha jab nick nei judy ke liye stuckup kiya jab BOGo nei use quit karne ka demand kiya
I agree, he definitely showed some development there, possibly just gratitude.	main sahmat huun, unhone nishchit roop seey vahaan kuchh vikas dikhaaya, sambhavatah kewal aabhar.	mein maantha hoon, voh toh kuch development showed kiya, kuch gratitude bhi
Did you think that the use of drugs in the movie was a bit too much? (the creation of drugs I should say)/	kyaa aapako lagaa kii film mein drugs kaa istemal kuchh jyada hii thaa? (davaaon kaa nirmaan mujhe kahana chaahiye)/	kya aap ko kuch aise nahi laga ki movies mein drug ka usage kuch jaasti tha?
I think it was innocent enough. Probably too complicated of a plot line to really do any harm to kids.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh kaafee nirdosh thaa. sambhavatah kathaanak itna jatil haye kii vaastav mein bachchon koo koee nuksan naheen pahunch sakata.	muje lagtha hein ki voh innocent tha. aur kuch plot line mein add kiye honge toh voh aur complicated ban saktha aur kids ke liye toh harm ho saktha tha
They could get the jist of it, that bellwether made the wolves do bad things, but beyond that, they probably didn't relate it to drugs as we think of them	way iska saar samajh sakate they, kii belvedar ney bhediyon seey burey kaam karavaae, lekin isase parey, unhone shayed ise davaaon seey naheen jodaa jaisa kii humm unake baare mein sochate hain	jo kiya so paayega, jab wolves ne bad things kiya lekin voh drug se relate nahi kiya, jo hum soch rahe they
I know what you mean.	mujhe pataa haye kii aapka kyaa aashay haye.	muje patha hein aap kya aap bole
My young cousin asked me what they were and why he was making them what they do to people, etc. So it might not influence most children but definitely some.	merey yuva chachere bhaai ney mujhase poochha kii way kyaa hain aur vaha unhein aisaa kyon banaa rhaa haye joe way logon key saath karate hain, aadi. isaliye yeh adhikansh bachchon koo prabhaavit naheen curr sakata haye, lekin nishchit roop seey kuchh koo.	mera choti cousin pucha ki voh kya hein aur kyon us loog kon hein aur bla bla. isliye mein children ko nahi influence karne devunga.
