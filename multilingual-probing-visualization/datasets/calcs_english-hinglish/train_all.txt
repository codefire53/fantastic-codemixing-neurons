I just learned it was based on the book today. I'm definitely going to have to read it.	mujhe aaj hii pataa chalaa kii yeh kitab parr adharit thaa. mujhe nishchit roop seey ise padhana hoga.	mein kuch learn kiya hein us book se aaj.. mein definitely padunga
Apparently, the biographical part of the movie isn't exactly true to life, since the movie was based on the book. Mark Zuckerberg had no part in contributing to the movie.	jahira taur parr, film kaa jeevani vaalaa hissa jeevan key prati bilkul sach naheen haye, kyonki film kitab parr adharit thee. film mein yogdan dene mein maark jukerberg kii koee bhoomika naheen thee.	acha tho biographical part tho is movie mein jarur sach kaha hoga.. kyon ki is movie tho book ka based hein.. mark zuckerberg tho koi contribute nahi deya hoga
That is certainly interesting to know. I always wondered about it myself. Apparently, Saverin was the only consultant with any true to life information.	yeh jaanana nishchit roop seey dilchasp haye. main swayam isake baare mein hamesha sochata rahata thaa. jahir taur parr, severine jeevan seey judee sachchi jaankaari rakhane vaale ekmatra salaahkaar they.	Ye janna jarur interesting hai. Main hamesha is bare me sochta tha. Apparently, Saverin akela consultant tha jiske paas koi true to life information thi.
Was it weird to see Armie Hammer play two people?	kyaa armi hammer koo dou logon kii bhoomika nibhaate dekhana ajib thaa?	Kya Armie Hammer ko do log play karte hue dekhna weird tha?
It was! To be honest with you they did such a good job that I had a hard time realizing they were both Armie Hammer. He is an amazing actor. I also think Facesmash is a hilarious startup name.	vaha thaa! imandari seey kahuun tou unhone itna achchha kaam kiya kii mujhe yeh samajhane mein kathinaaee hui kii way donon armi hammer they. vaha ack adbhut abhineta hain. mujhe bhee lagata haye kii facesmash ack prafullit karane vaalaa startup naam haye.	Wo tha! To be honest unhone itna accha kaam kiya ke mujhe realize nahi hua dono Armie Hammer the. Wo ek amazing actor hai. Main ye bhi sochta hu k Facesmash ek hilarious startup name hai
It is! and what a crazy story... basically he got dumped and made millions off of trying to get even with her.	yeh haye! aur kyaa ajib kahani haye... mool roop seey usey chhod diyaa gayaa aur usake saath talmel bithaane kii koshish mein usane lakhon rupaye kamaaye.	Ye hai! Kya crazy story hai ..basically wo dumped hogaya aur usse badle lete huye millions kama liye
How contentious of a person. Based off what you know of him would you have be friendly with him if you were in school with him at the time?	kitna vivadaspad vyakti haye. aap usake baare mein joe jaanate hain usake aadhar parr yadi aap usa samay usake saath school mein hotey tou kyaa aap usake saath mitratapurna vyavhaar karate?	Kinda contentious banda hai. Jitna tum abhi jaante ho, agar uske saath school me hote to kya uske sath friendly hote?
Hmm... probably not. He doesn't seem to have good luck keeping friends. How ironic as he invented Facebook. Do you think you'd have been friends?	humm... shayed naheen. aisaa lagata haye kii dost rakhane mein usaki kismat achchi naheen haye. kitni vidambana haye kii unhone facebook kaa aavishkaar kiya. kyaa aapako lagata haye kii aap dost hotey?	Hmm.. shayad nahi. Dost rakhne me to uska koi accha luck nahi hai. Kitna ironic hai k usne Facebook invent kiya. Tum kya sochte ho, kya uske dost hote?
Absolutely not 1	bilkul naheen 1	Bilkul nahi.
I thought it was ironic as well. I couldnt believe it.	mujhe bhee yeh vidambana hii luggy. main iss parr vishvaas naheen curr sakaa.	Maine bhi socha tha k ye ironic hai. Mujhe to believe nahi hua
The scene where Christy Lee says Facebook me is kinda funny, too. It certainly beats facesmash me.	vaha drishya jahaan christy lii kahati haye kii facebook mee, bhee thodaa ajib haye. yeh nishchit roop seey mujhe facemash seey maat detaa haye.	Wo scene jaha Christy Lee bolti hai Facebook me funny type ka hai. Certainly facesmash me bolne se to accha hai.
Agreed. It makes sense, but I had no idea how much help Zuckerberg had along the way... Especially from one of the founders of Napster!	maan gayaa. yeh samajh mein aataa haye, lekin mujhe naheen pataa thaa kii iss dauran zuckerberg koo kitni madad millie... khaskar napster key sansthapakon mein seey ack seey!	Agreed. Iska sense to banta hai but mujhe koi idea nahi tha ki Zuckerberg ko raaste me kitni help mili hai, especially Napster k ek founder se.
Justin Timberlake plays him so well too. I never knew about it either, but keep in mind it's based off the book. Who knows how much he actually was involved.	justine timberlake bhee unaka kirdar bahut achche seey nibhaate hain. main isake baare mein kabhi naheen jaanata thaa, lekin dhyaan rakhein kii yeh kitab parr adharit haye. kaun jaanata haye kii vaha vaastav mein kitna shamil thaa.	Justin Timberlake ne use bahut acha play kiya hai. Mujhe bhi is baare me kuch nahi pata tha, lekin ye dhyan me rakho k ye book pe based hai. Kise pata wo actually kitna involved tha.
That is true. I wonder if Mark Zuckerberg actually invited Sean Parker to live at Facebook headquarters!	yeh sach haye. mujhe ashcharya haye kii kyaa maark jukerberg ney vaastav mein shaun parker koo facebook mukhyalaya mein rahane key liye aamantrit kiya thaa!	Ye to sahi hai. Main is soch me hu ki kya Mark Zuckerberg ne Sean Parker ko actually Facebook ke headquarters me rehne k liye bulaya tha!
I love how he was doing it from a house. You know that much happened. If Sean Parker was there, who knows. I love how tech company start ups are out of houses. I wonder what the other continent was they were trying to expand to first.	mujhe achchha lagaa kii vaha ise ack ghar seey kaise curr rhaa thaa. aap jaanate hain kii bahut kuchh huaa. yadi shaun parker vahaan hotaa, tou kaun jaanata. mujhe yeh pasand haye kii kaise tech company key startup ghar seey baahar nikalate hain. mujhe ashcharya haye kii way pahale kiss dusare mahadweep kaa vistaar karane kii koshish curr rahey they.	Unka ye sab ghar se karna mujhe pasand aaya. Tumhe pata hai kitna kuch hua. Agar Sean Parker waha rahta to, kise pata. I love kaise ye tech company start up ghar se chal rahi hai. I wonder wo kaunse dusre continent me pahle expand karna chahte the
I think that it is pretty funny considering the success he gained... and "Thefacebook"? First Facesmash, then Harvard Connection then Thefacebook... yikes!	mujhe lagata haye kii usey millie safalata koo dekhate hue yeh kaafee hasyaspad haye... aur "dafesbook"? pahale facesmash, phir harvard connection, phir dafesbook... vaah!	I think  uski success ko consider  karte hue Thefacebook kafi funny hai. Pahle Facesmash, phir Harvard Connection phir TheFacebook yikes!
Thefacebook is just rotten. It seems like Zuckerberg really shafted everyone else in the situation.	facebook bilkul sarh chuka haye. aisaa lagata haye jaise zuckerberg ney vaastav mein iss sthiti mein baaki sabhi koo prabhaavit kiya haye.	Thefacebook to bilkul bekaar hai. Aisa lagta hai Zuckerberg ne sahi me dusre logo ki leli
It's kind of creepy how he just waited for Albright to accept the friend request, too.	yeh kaafee daravana haye kii kaise usane albrite key friend request sweekar karane kaa intezar kiya.	Uska Albright ka friend request accept karne tak wait karna kaafi creepy tha
It's really sort of sad to me. He hasn't really changed from the beginning of the story.	yeh merey liye sachmuch bahut dukhad haye. vaha vaastav mein kahani kii shuruat seey naheen badala haye.	Mujhe to ye sad laga. Wo story ki beginning se jyada badla nahi.
That's how I feel. I'm not surprised he had to do a settlement.	mujhe aisaa lagaata haye. mujhe ashcharya naheen haye kii usey samjhauta karna padaa.	Mujhe to aisa lagta hai. Main surprise nahi hu ke use settlement karna pada
He founded the biggest social network the world has ever seen, but he seems like a person who people hate.	unhone duniya key abb taka key sabse badey soshal network kii sthaapana kii, lekin vaha ack aise vyakti kii tarah dikhate hain jinase loga nafrat karate hain.	Usne duniya ka sabse bada social network banaya but wo ek aisa aadmi lagta hai jise log hate karte hai
Extremely misanthropic. I would agree. It's overall kind of sad.	atyant manavadveshi. mujhe sweekar hoga. yeh kull milakar dukhad haye.	Bilkul misanthropic. Main to agree karta hu. Overall ye sad hai.
At least he didn't use his intelligence for true evil.	cumm seey cumm usane apani buddhi kaa prayog sachchi burai key liye naheen kiya.	USNE  BURAEE KARNE KE LIYE DIMAAK KA UPAYOG NAHI KIYA

Hello! Do you like superhero movies?	namaste! kyaa aapako superheiro filmein pasand hain?	Namaste! aap ko superhero movies aaccha lagega kya?
yes. batman begins! I think this a great batman film. have you seen it?	haan. batman shuru hotaa haye! mujhe lagata haye kii yeh ack behtareen batman film haye. kyaa aapane ise dekhaa haye?	ha. batman start huwa! mene socha hi ki ee batman film tho great hi. aap dekha hi kya?
Yes, I have. Christian Bale is my favorite Batman so far.	haan merey paas haye. christian bell meraa abb taka kaa pasandida batman haye.	ha. mere pas hi. Christian Bale tho mera favorite Batman hi abhi tak.
Do you usually check the ratings of movies before you see them?	kyaa aap aamtaur parr filmein dekhane seey pahale unaki rating dekhate hain?	aap movies ka ratings dekega kya , dekhne ke pehle ?
I usually do. but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not	main aamtaur parr kartaa huun. lekin rating kii khuraak yeh taya naheen karati kii main film dekhunga yaa naheen	mene dekungi. lekin rating se kuch farak nahi padega , jho mene dekungi ya nahi.
The film has several great big name actors, which is another reason I like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone	film mein kaee badey naami kalakar hain, yahee ack aur kaaran haye kii mujhe yeh pasand haye aur main ise kewal abhinetaon key aadhar parr hii dekhunga	ee film tho bahut great bada actors tha, ee tho dusara reason hi mere kho aacha laga aur mene dekungi bina actors keliye.
I agree, there are quite a few great actors in Batman Begins. I like Liam Neeson too, even though he is one of the villains.	main sahmat huun, batman begins mein kaee mahaan kalakar hain. mujhe liam neesan bhee pasand haye, bhale hii vaha khalnayakon mein seey ack haye.	ha, bahut sara great actors hi Batman Begins me. mene like karungi Liam Neeson tho bi, vo tho eek villain be hi.
seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest. along with super heros and villans.  a good  rating does help me feel like I will not waste my time watching something awful	badey parde parr mahaan abhinetaon kii kshamata koo ack saath dekhane seey merrie ruchi nishchit roop seey badhati haye. super hiro aur khalnayak key saath.  ack achchi rating mujhe yeh mahsoos karane mein madad karati haye kii main kuchh bhayaanak dekhane mein apana samay barbad naheen karuungaa	utna potential hi actors me dekhke big screen mere kho bahut interest aaya tha. milke dono super heros aur villans bhi hi. isko aacha rating help karega , mene time waste mat karungi dusara awful movie dekhke.
but the same time will not deter me from a film If i am just into the genre	lekin aggar main sirf isi shally mein huun tou samay mujhe film seey naheen rokega	lekin same time me mene nahi deter karungi ee film se if mene just genre dekhke.
I personally prefer good ratings. Even if a movie has many good actors, if it's rated poorly, I usually won't watch it in theaters.	main vyaktigat roop seey achchi rating pasand kartaa huun. bhale hii kissy film mein kaee achche kalakar houn, aggar usey kharab rating milati haye, tou main aamtaur parr usey cinemagharon mein naheen dekhunga.	Main personally acchi ratings prefer karta hun .Even agar kisi movie mein kayi acche actors hain lekin agar uski rating kharab hai to main usko usually theaters mein nahi dekhta.
I'm not sure if I agree with the Metacritic Score of 70/100, though.	haalaanki, mujhe yakeen naheen haye kii main 70/100 key metacritic score seey sahmat huun.	Waise mein sure nahi hun ki mein Metacritic  ke 70/100 score se agree karunga.
The 84% on Rotten Tomatoes seems more accurate.	rotten tomatose parr 84% adhik sateek lagata haye.	Rotten Tomatoes pe 84%  zyada accurate lagta hai.
I will generally have enough patience to wait for a film to be released on DVD/Video if the rating turn me off.	aggar rating mujhe nirash karati haye tou aam taur parr merey paas dvd/video parr film release honey kii prateeksha karane key liye paryaapt dhairya hoga.	Generally mere paas enough patience hota hai to wait for a film to be released on DVD/Video agar mujhe rating pasand nahi aati.
What did you think of the bat scene in the movie?	aapane film mein balle vaale drishya key baare mein kyaa socha?	Movie ke bat scene ke baare mein kya khyal hai ?
I felt that scene shows the story of this film well, and is thought out.	mujhe lagaa kii vaha seane iss film kii kahani koo achche seey dikhaata haye aur socha-samajha haye.	Main sochta hun ki ye scene shows the story of this film well, kaafi socha samjha hai.
I wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well, though.	haalaanki, mujhe ashcharya haye kii kyaa sookhe kuein key alawa chamgaadadon key liye koee behtar jagah thee.	Waise I wonder ki bats ke liye dry well se behtar koi place ho sakti thi kya
batman as a child was good step by the filmm aker to show how his life started out	bachpan mein batman kaa kirdar nibhana film nirmaata dwara yeh dikhaane kaa achchha kadam thaa kii usake jeevan kii shuruat kaise hui	batman as a child accha step tha by the filmmaker ye dikhane ke liye ki uski life kaise start hui
Because this movie is called Batman Begins, I agree that it was appropriate to show Bruce's beginnings.	kyonki iss film kaa naam batman begins haye, main sahmat huun kii broose kii shuruat koo dikhaana uchit thaa.	Because movie ka naam Batman Begins hai so I agree ki Bruce ki shuruaati life dikhana appropriate hai.
I think it's ironic that the mugger's name is Joe Chill, but he isn't  chill if he murders people.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh vidambana haye kii lutere kaa naam joe chill haye, lekin aggar vaha logon kii hatyaa kartaa haye tou vaha shaant naheen haye.	Mere khyal se ye ironic hi hai ki mugger's name is Joe Chill , lekin wo chill nahi hai if he murders people.
unlikely yes, I think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be.  but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to   the bats	asambhaavit haan, mujhe lagata haye kii way yeh dikhaane key liye ack rahasyamay shuruat karane jaa rahey they kii batman kaise banaa.  lekin phir bhee vaha kuchh rahasya chhodana chaahata haye kyonki usey abhee bhee chamgaadadon seey darr lagata haye	unlikely haan, mujhe lagta hai wo batman kaise bana k ek mysterious beginning dikhana chahte the, but phir bhi thodi mystery chhodna chahte the ke use bats ka phobia kaise hota hai.
very ironic. mr chill is more of a bone  chilling murderer.	bahut vidambanapurna. mister chill ack haddiyan kampa dene vaalaa hatyara haye.	bahut ironic, mr chill to ek bone chilling murdered hai
He is also murdered too, so at least he gets what he deserves.	usaki bhee hatyaa curr dee jaati haye, isaliye cumm seey cumm usey vahee milata haye jiska vaha hakdar haye.	Uska bhi murder hojata hai, to kam se kam wo jo deserve karta hai use mil jata hai
he got whats coming to him. but  bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge	usey vaha mill gayaa joe usake paas aaa rhaa haye. lekin broose usaki hatyaa naheen curr paataa isaliye mujhe lagata haye kii vaha badala lena chaahata haye	Jo uske liye hona tha usko mil jata hai. But brucse uska murder nahi karta to main sochta hu wo uski badla leni ki chahat rah jaati hai.
I think it helps to establish that Bruce will not directly murder anyone. Even when he burns down the League of Shadows, he doesn't directly kill Ra's al Ghul.	mujhe lagata haye kii isase yeh sthaapit karane mein madad milegi kii broose seedhe taur parr kissy kii hatyaa naheen karega. yahaan taka ​​kii jaba vaha leag off shados koo jalaa detaa haye, taba bhee vaha seedhe taur parr raa all ghul koo naheen maartaa haye.	Mujhe lagta hai iss ye establish hone me help hoti hai k Bruce kabhi kisi ka directly murder nahi karte. Even jab wo league of Shadows ko jala deta hai, Ra's al Ghul ko directly nahi maarta hai.
Injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder, in any case.	kissy bhee mamle mein anyaay koo hatyaa key kaaran key roop mein istemal naheen kiya jaanaa chaahiye.	Injustice kabhi bhi murder ka reason nahi hona chaiye
I feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows, and to purge his fear of bats. this key part I think is pretty lucky break for him. as he is doing jail time in a foreign country.	mujhe lagata haye kii vaha chhaaya leag kaa hissa banane aur chamgaadadon key prati apane darr koo door karane key liye bhagyashali haye. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh mahatvapurna hissa usake liye bahut bhagyashali break haye. kyonki vaha videsh mein jail kii sazaa kaat rhaa haye.	Mujhe lagta hai ke wo lucky tha k league of shadows ka part ban gaya aur apne bats k dar ko hata diya.
It is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing...	yeh ajib haye kii uska parivaar ack butler kaa kharch uthaa sakata thaa lekin vaha chori key aarop mein jail chalaa gayaa...	Ye kaafi strange hai k uski family butler afford kar sakti hai but wo jail chor karne k liye jata hai
I really like Gary Oldman as Gordon. He plays a good cop really well.	main vaastav mein gorden key roop mein gairi oldman koo pasand kartaa huun. vaha ack achche pulis vaale kii bhoomika bahut achche seey nibhaate hain.	Mujhe Gary Oldman as Gordon accha laga. Wo ek good cop accha play karta hai

and batman was poisoned with the fear-inducing drugs, I thought it was over for him.	aur batman koo darr paida karane vaali davaaon seey jahar dey diyaa gayaa, mujhe lagaa kii yeh usake liye khatm hoe gayaa haye.	aur batman fear-inducing drugs se poisoned tha, mujhe laga uska sab over hai
It appeared to be over for many characters in this movie at different points, yeah.	haan, aisaa prateet huaa kii iss film key kaee paatron key liye alag-alag binduon parr yeh khatm hoe gayaa haye.	haan, puri movie mein kafi points par aisa laga ki kafi character ke liye it was over
I was surprised when the real Ra's al Ghul showed himself, too. The League of Shadows doesn't die easily.	mujhe ashcharya huaa jaba asli raas all ghul ney khud koo dikhaaya. chhaayaon kii leag aasaani seey khatm naheen hoti.	main bhi surprised tha jab asli Ra's al Ghul ne khud ko dikhaya.  League of Shadows asaani se nahi marta
He seems to have otherworldy power after surviving his past experiences	aisaa lagata haye kii apane pichale anubhavon seey bache rahane key baad usake paas doosari duniya kii shakti haye	lagta hai past experience survive karne ke baad usme otherworldy power they
Hey	arey	aho
Hi	namaste	HELLO
How’s it going?	yeye kaisa chala rhaa haye?	KAISA CHAL RAHA HAI?
Pretty good. Are you a Marvel fan?	bahut achchha. kyaa aap marval key prashansak hain?	ACHA. KYA AAP MARVEL KA FAN HO?
Good to hear. Sure, what about you?	sunane mein achchha. zaroor, aapke baare mein kyaa?	SUN KE ACHA LAGA. AAP KA BHAT KYA HAI?
Yes, I am a huge Marvel fan. One of my favorites is the Avengers. Mark Ruffalo is great as The Hulk.	haan, main marval kaa bahut badaa prashansak huun. merey pasandida mein seey ack avengers haye. dha hulk key roop mein maark rafaalo mahaan hain.	HA MAIN BAHOOT BADA MARVEL FAN HUH . AVENGERS MERA FAVORITE AUR MARK RUFFALO BAHOOT BADIA THA HULK JAISAA.
Sure, I liked the Avengers a lot.	zaroor, mujhe avengers bahut pasand aaee.	TEEK HAI , MERE KHO BHI AVENGERS PASANDH HAI
I also think Ruffalo is a great Hulk.	main bhee sochata huun kii rafalo ack mahaan hulk haye.	MAIN BHI YE SOCH RAHA KI MARK RUFFALO BADIA HAI HULK KE LIYA.
Is Avengers the movie we’re supposed to talk about?	kyaa avengers vaha film haye jisake baare mein hamein baat karni chaahiye?	kya Avengers aesi Movie he ki hame iske bare me talk karna chahiye?
Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92% rating and average of 8/10. Yes, I believe so.	rotten tomatose ney ise 92% rating aur ausat 8/10 diyaa. haan, meraa aisaa maanana ​​haye.	Rottten Tomatoes ne ise 92% rating di he aur 8/10 ka average. ya , me aisa believe karta hu.
Okay then. Right, I’ve always experiened that IMDB gives movies a lower average rating than rotten tomatoes.	achchha taba. thheek haye, maine hamesha anubhav kiya haye kii imdb filmon koo sadey hue tamataron kii tulana mein cumm ausat rating detaa haye.	tab oke he. Right, me hamesha experience kiya he ki Rotten Tomatoes ke comparison me  IMDB movies ko lower average rating deta he.
Tha	thaa	not he it is tha
That's true	yeh sach haye	ye to sure he
But I guess 92 and 80 are a fair assesment.	lekin mujhe lagata haye kii 92 aur 80 ack uchit mulyankan haye.	but mujhe lagta he ki 92 aur 80 to fair rating assessment he.
Yeah, I think Joss Whedon was a good choice for director also. His vision was really inline with the comics.	haan, mujhe lagata haye kii joss wheadon nirdeshak key liye bhee ack achchha vikalp they. unaka drishtikon vaastav mein comics key anuroop thaa.	han, mujhe lagta he ki director ke liye bhi Joss Whedon good choice . uska vision comics ke sath vastav me inline tha.
Well, I can’t speak for the comics (haven’t read them), but this movie is a great mashup of all the heroes and their stories.	khair, main comics key baare mein kuchh naheen kaha sakata (maine unhein padhaa naheen haye), lekin yeh film sabhi nayakon aur unaki kahaaniyon kaa ack behtareen mishran haye.	well, me comics ke regarding to kah nahi sakta (me unhe read nahi kiya ke), but ye movies all heroes aur unki stories ka ek great mashup ke.
I guess it’s just a very good movie with an amazing plot.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh adbhut kathaanak vaali ack bahut achchi film haye.	meraguess ye he ki ye ek very good movie he amazing plot ke sath
I agree.	main sahmat huun.	me agree karta hu.
Loki using Clint Barton to help him with the Tesseract was awesome too. I like him even though he's a bad guy	loki dwara tesseract mein madad key liye clint barton kaa upayog karna bhee adbhut thaa. bhale hii vaha ack buraa aadami haye, phir bhee main usey pasand kartaa huun	Loki ka Clint Barton ko use karna  Tesseract ki liye help k liye bhi awesome tha. Mujhe wo pasand hai even though wo bad guy hai
Right, that was a great scene.	sahee haye, vaha bahut badhiya drishya thaa.	Haan, badhiya scene tha.
Loki’s a likable villain I’d say.	main kahoonga kii loki ack aakarshak khalnayak haye.	Main bolunga k Loki ek likable villain hai
It was interesting how it caused such a riff within The Avengers. Thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie.	yeh dilchasp thaa kii isane avengers key bheetar iss tarah kii daraar kaise paida kii. thore koo abb bhee aisaa mahsoos hoe rhaa thaa kii film key dauran lambe samay taka usake prati usaki wafadari rahee.	Avengers me uska kaha suni karwarna kaafi interesting tha. Thor ko movie k doran aise lag raha tha uske liye loyalty hai
You think?	aapako lagata haye?	Tum ye sochte ho?
I thought he was pretty ruthless with him.	mujhe lagaa kii vaha usake prati bahut nirdayi thaa.	Mujhe to laga wo uske saath kaafi ruthless tha
That’s just my opinion obviously.	jahir taur parr yeh sirf merrie raay haye.	Wo bas mera opinion hai obviously.
I can see that somewhat but he could have done a lot more damage if he wanted to.	main ise kuchh hudd taka dekh sakata huun lekin aggar vaha chaahata tou bahut adhik nuksan curr sakata thaa.	Main wo dekh sakta hu but mujhe lagta hai wo bahut jyada damagar kar sakta tha agar wo chahta wo
Do you have a specific example on mind?	kyaa aapke munn mein koee vishisht udaaharan haye?	Tumhare mind me koi specific example hai?
The end fight scene definitely was. He could have killed him.	antim ladaai kaa drishya nishchit roop seey thaa. vaha usey maar sakata thaa.	Wo end fight scene definitely. Wo use maar sakta tha.
Oh, the one where Hulk ends up hitting him?	oh, vahee jahaan hulk antatah usey maartaa haye?	oh wha kha hai jise hulk maar rha hai?
Yeah, that was classic. One of the funniest moments of the movie. I also liked when Iron Man fell back through the wormhole. It had everyone on edge I think.	haan, vaha classic thaa. film key sabse majedar palon mein seey ack. mujhe yeh bhee achchha lagaa jaba iron maine wormhole seey vaapas gir gayaa. mujhe lagata haye kii isase harr koee utsaahit thaa.	ha yeh classic tha film ke sabse majedar samay mai se ek muje bhi pasand aya maine wormhole ke madhyam se vapas gir gaya muje lgta hai ki yeh har kisi ke pass tha
Absolutely. Epic scenes.	bilkul. mahakavya drishya.	bilkul mahakavya ke scenes hai
Can we talk about other movies or just this one?	kyaa humm anya filmon yaa sirf isi film key baare mein baat curr sakate hain?	kya hum isse movie ke bare mai charcha ker sakte hai?
You know, MCU	tumhen pataa haye, mcu	kya tum MCU jante ho?
I also like the way Nick Fury stood his ground with the Council. Just this one.	jiss tarah seey nick fury ney council key saath apana paksh rakhaa, vaha bhee mujhe pasand aayaa. buss yahee vaalaa.	muje bhi yeh pasand hai ki nick fury ne council ke sath apna ground bta diya sirk yeh ek
Understood.	samajha.	samaj gya
Yeah, Fury’s great too.	haan, fury bhee badhiya haye.	ha fury bhi bhota bada hai
So, any final thoughts?	tou, koee antim vichaar?	to koi akhri sujhav?
It's crazy that the Council wanted him to drop a nuclear missile into New York.	yeh ajib baat haye kii parishad chaahati thee kii vaha newyork mein paramanu missile giraaye.	ye crazy baat hai ki council chahti hai ki nuclear missile new york par gire
Great examples, man.	mahaan udaaharan, yaar.	great udahran, man
It was great talking to another MCU fan.	ack anya mcu prashansak seey baat karke bahut achchha lagaa.	Another MCU fan se talk karna great tha

Hello! Isn't Monsters University a great movie? It was true to the spirit of Monsters, Inc. and matched its tone.	namaste! kyaa monsters university ack behtareen film naheen haye? yeh monsters, ink. kii bhavna key anuroop thaa aur usake swar seey mell khaata thaa.	hello... monsters university kya acha movie hien? kya vaakahi mein spirit of monsters sach hein, aur unka tone matched hein
I agree.  It was a good movie	main sahmat huun.  yeh ack achchi film thee	mein maantha hoon.. badiya movie hein
What was your favorite part?	aapka pasandida hissa kyaa thaa?	favorite part konsa hein?
I liked when Mike and Sully didn't finish the program and worked their way up the ranks anyways.	mujhe achchha lagaa jaba mike aur sulee ney karyakram puuraa naheen kiya aur phir bhee rank mein oopar aaney key liye kaam kiya.	jab mike aur sully apne program finish nahi hote aur unhone saath ranks karne ke work kar rahe the, us scene ko muje pasand hein
Me too! It was very inspiring and showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways. I liked how the movie expanded on the monster world.	main bhee! yeh bahut preranadayak thaa aur dikhaaya kii aap apane sapnon koo kaee tarikon seey puuraa curr sakate hain. mujhe yeh pasand aayaa kii kaise film rakshas duniya parr vistaarit hui.	muje bhi! kitna inspiring hein yar, isse patha chaltha hein ki hum kaise apne dreams ko accomplish karthe jo jarur sach hoga... muje tho is movie ka monster world expanded bahut pasand hein
Yes.  The first movie only gave one facet of the world, while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree.	haan.  pahali film ney duniya kaa kewal ack pahalu pesh kiya, jabaki doosari ney setting koo bahut badey paimaane parr vikasit kiya.	haan.. first movie ne yek facet world diya hein, second tho larger degree ko diya hein
When I heard they were making another Monsters Inc movie I expected a sequel, not a prequel. But I ended up loving it! Did you see it in theatres?	jaba maine sunaa kii way ack aur monsters ink film banaa rahey hain tou mujhe prekwal naheen balki seekwal kii ummeed thee. lekin aakhirkaar mujhe isase pyaar hoe gayaa! kyaa aapane ise cinemagharon mein dekhaa?	agar voh dusra monsters inc banaye tho jarur sequel he expect karenge pequel nahi,.. lekin end tho badiya hein.. aap theatres mein dekhe kya?
I don't think we saw it in the theatre.  I think we rented it.  It's been a while though.  I should show it to my kids.  They would probably like it.	mujhe naheen lagata kii hamane ise theatre mein dekhaa haye.  mujhe lagata haye kii hamane ise kiraaye parr liya haye.  haalaanki kaafee samay hoe gayaa haye.  mujhe ise apane bachchon koo dikhaana chaahiye.  unhein shayed yeye pasand aayega.	theatre mein tho dekha yaad nahi hein... muje lagtha hum rented... bachon ko jarur dekhavunga..
I bet they would! I don't have kids but my coworkers do. I love Disney/Pixar movies so I recommend them to my coworkers a lot.	mujhe yakeen haye way aisaa karenge! merey bachche naheen hain lekin merey sahakarmiyon key bachche hain. mujhe disney/pixer filmein pasand hain isaliye main apane sahakarmiyon koo unaki bahut anushansa kartaa huun.	jarur, mera pas kid nahi hei, lekin mere coworkers ke paas hein... muje disney pixar movies pasand hein, isliye mein apne coworkers ko jarur recommend karunga
I really enjoy Randy Newman's music on this, the Toy Story movies, and Finding Nemo/Dory.	main vaastav mein iss parr randy neuman key sangeet, toy story filmon aur finding nimo/dorry kaa anand letaa huun.	randy newmans ka  music ko enjoy karunga, the toy story movies aur finding nemo/ dory
Me too! I think the Toy Story movies might be my favorite Pixar movies. Did you hear that they're building a Toy Story Land in Walt Disney World this summer?	main bhee! mujhe lagata haye kii toy story filmein merrie pasandida pixer filmein hoe sakati hain. kyaa aapane sunaa haye kii way iss garmi mein walt disney worled mein ack toy story laind kaa nirmaan curr rahey hain?	me bhi! toy story movies from pixar mere favorite movies hai.tereko pata hai kya wo log toy story land bana rahe hai walt disny world mai ye summer mai.
I did hear that.  It sounds pretty interesting.	maine vaha sunaa.  yeh kaafee dilchasp lagata haye.	ha suna maine, acha hoga shayad
I'm going to WDW in the fall so I'm excited to see how the park is. Have you ever been? Or to Disneyland?	main patjhad mein wdw jaa rhaa huun isaliye main yeh dekhane key liye utsaahit huun kii park kaisa haye. kyaa aap kabhi gaye hain? yaa disneyland key liye?	mai wdw ja raha hy, bahor excitement hai park dekhne ki, tu kabhi gaya hai ya disneyland ko ?
I've been to WDW a few times.  Never to Disneyland though.  California is pretty far away from me.  We went camping at WDW last year though.  It was great.	main kuchh baar wdw gayaa huun.  haalaanki disneyland kabhi naheen.  california mujhase kaafee door haye.  haalaanki humm pichale saal wdw mein camping key liye gaye they.  yeh bahut achchha thaa.	ha wdw ko kuch bar gaya hu, disney land ko nahi gaya. california dur hai mujhse.hum camping krne gaye the wdw pichle sal. maja aaya tha.
That's what I'm doing in the fall! I'm really looking forward to camping there!	main patjhad mein yahee curr rhaa huun! main vaastav mein vahaan camping karane key liye utsuk huun!	wahi mai karne wala hu  ye fall mai,rah dekh raha hu camping krne ki
It was really great.  We camped for four nights I think.  It rained like crazy the first day, but it was still fun.	yeh sachmuch bahut badhiya thaa.  mujhe lagata haye kii hamane chaar raaton taka derra daala.  pahale dinn pagalon kii tarah barish hui, lekin phir bhee mazaa aayaa.	bahot mast hai. humne char rat camoing kiya, pehle din bahot barish giri,but maja aaya.
Do you like Mike or Sulley better?	kyaa aapako mike yaa sule adhik pasand hain?	tuzhe mike ya sulle mai se kon pasand hai jyada
Oh good question! I think I like Mike more. He's weirdly optimistic.	oh achchha prashn! mujhe lagata haye kii mujhe mike adhik pasand haye. vaha ajib tarah seey ashawadi haye.	acha sawal hai, mujhe mike jyada acha lagta hai. wo alag hi optimistic hai.
How about you?	aap kaise hain?	tuzhe kya lagta hai
I like Mike because he's funnier.  He had some of the best lines in the first movie.	mujhe mike pasand haye kyonki vaha adhik mazakia haye.  pahali film mein unaki kuchh behtareen panktiyaan theen.	mujhe mike pasand hai kyu ki wo bahot funny hai. usme kuch behterin lines hai movie ke.
He is SO funny!!	vaha bahut mazakia haye!!	voh funny hein
I always liked John Goodman's voice acting for Sully, though. It's perfect for a big, fluffy monster	haalaanki, mujhe sulee key liye johnn goodman kii aavaaz hamesha pasand aaee. yeh ack badey, bhulakkad rakshas key liye bilkul upayukt haye	muje tho hamesha goodman ka voice pasand hein, big aur fluffy monster ke liye tho perfect hein
The part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes my kids laugh so hard.	pahali film key anta mein vaha hissa jaba vaha dakaar laker microphone bund curr detaa haye, merey bachche bahut hansate hain.	first movie ka end tho is part mein hein, jab voh microphone mein burps out kiya tho mera kids jor se has rahe they
I agree. John Goodman was a great choice for Sulley.	main sahmat huun. johnn goodman sule key liye ack behtareen vikalp they.	mein maantha hoon, john goodman ache choice hei sulley keliye
Hahah I bet!!!	hahaha mujhe yakeen haye!!!	haha
I love the scare machine they had in the prequel that the students had to frighten for the contest. That was pretty neat	mujhe prekwal mein unake paas maujood daraane vaali machine bahut pasand haye jise pratiyogita key liye chhaatron koo darana thaa. vaha bahut saaf-suthra thaa	muje scare machien pasand hein, voh prequel mein hein, jo students ko frighten huve us contest keliye. pretty neat hein
Yeah, though I was really disappointed with Sulley for cheating.	haan, haalaanki main dhokhadhadi key liye sule seey vaastav mein nirash thaa.	haan, sulley ka cheating se kuch disappoint hein
I was too, that broke my heart. I cried when that happened!	main bhee thaa, isase meraa dill toot gayaa. jaba aisaa huaa tou main row padaa!	mein bhi , mera dil tho thuth gaya. mein rone lage
It was really a cruel thing for him to do to MIke	usake liye mike key saath aisaa karna vaastav mein ack kroor baat thee	yeh tho sach mein cruel thing hein mike keliye
It seemed a little out of character for Sulley, but I guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving.	sule key liye yeh thodaa ajib lugg rhaa thaa, lekin mujhe lagata haye kii kathaanak koo aage badhaane key liye unake paas donon key beach sangharsh kaa koee antim srot honah chaahiye.	sulley keliye tho yeh little out character hein, lekin conflict ke liye tho unke paas final source jarur hoga,
I agree, it was probably my least favorite part of the movie. I feel like they could have taken the story in a different direction.	main sahmat huun, yeh shayed film kaa meraa sabse cumm pasandida hissa thaa. mujhe lagata haye kii way kahani koo ack alag disha mein leey jaa sakate they.	mein maantha hoon, yeh probably mera least favorite part hein is movie mien.. muje lagtha hein ki yeh story kuch different direction mein ja raha hein
For Sully to trick Mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful!	sulee key liye mike koo dhokha dekar yeh sochana kii vaha daravana haye, bahut dukhad thaa!	sully ko mike ko trick karne ko soch de tho voh dar gaya, kitna hurtful hein
I do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve their dreams though.  That's a good message that Disney started doing with the Princess and the Frog.	mujhe yeh pasand haye kii unhone apane sapnon koo hassil karane key liye itani mehnat kii.  yeh ack achchha sandesh haye jise disney ney rajkumari aur mendhak key saath shuru kiya.	muje us ending bahut pasand hein, jo apne dream achieve karne ke liye itna hard se work kiya.. ache message hein,disney ka... disney tho princess and the frog se start kiya aise message dene
Me too! I like that common thread between the two movies. I think it was executed better in this though, because they really did start from the very bottom of Monsters, Inch	main bhee! mujhe donon filmon key beach kaa samanya sootra pasand haye. mujhe lagata haye kii isamen ise behtar dhang seey nishpaadit kiya gayaa thaa, kyonki unhone vaastav mein monsters, inch key bahut neeche seey shuruat kii thee	muje bhi in dono movies ka common thread pasand hein... muje lagtha yeh thoda better se executed kiya hein, kyon ki bottom of monster se start kiya
And it explains why they're always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie.  They were once in that same position.	aur yeh bataata haye kii way mool film mein anya bevakoof chaukidaaron key prati hamesha achche kyon rahate hain.  way ack samay usee sthiti mein they.	aur in mein explain kiya ki kaise voh janitors ka original moives se ache hein... same position mein tho hein voh
Oh my gosh!!! I didn't even realize that! I have to rewatch the movie. You're totally right!	oh, merey bhagwan!!! mujhe iska ehsas hii naheen huaa! mujhe film dobara dekhani hogi. aap bilkul sahee hain!	omg! muje realize hi nahi huva! mein is movie ko dubara dekhna pasand karunga.. aap bilkul sahi hein
It does show a really good message for kids, to be respectful of everybody	yeh bachchon key liye vaastav mein ack achchha sandesh dikhaata haye, harr kissy kaa sammaan karna	isme kids keliye ache message hein, jo respectful hein sabhi keliye
It's a valuable message.  Be kind and respectful to everyone.  Don't expect to lean on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in life.  Just be prepared to work your hardest.	yeh ack bahumulya sandesh haye.  sabhi key prati dayalu aur sammaanjanak rahein.  yeh apeksha naa karein kii aap jeevan mein aage badhane key liye apani saakh yaa parivarik pratishtha kaa sahaara lenge.  buss apani sabse kadee mehnat karane key liye taiyar rahein.	in mein, valuable message hein, sabhi ke saath kind aur respectful hona.. apni credentials aur family reputation ke liye kabhi life mein lean mat hona.. sirf prepare se ho
Yes! I liked that they showed Sully as this spoiled brat at first who eventually learned that you can't always lean on your family's reputation. It can only get you so far	haan! mujhe achchha lagaa kii unhone shuruat mein sulee koo ack bigdail ladke key roop mein dikhaaya, jisane antatah seekha kii aap hamesha apane parivaar kii pratishtha parr nirbhar naheen reh sakate. yeh aapako kewal itani door taka hii leey jaa sakata haye	haan! muje bhi sully ka spoiled brat pehela pasand hein, jo apni family reputation ke liye kabhi lean nahi hota..
Maybe his spoiled background is why he cheated in the competition, because he didn't really realize the consequences of his actions, just did what he thought was right	hoe sakata haye kii usaki kharab prishthabhoomi key kaaran hii usane pratiyogita mein dhokha diyaa hoe, kyonki usey vaastav mein apane kaaryon key parinamon kaa ehsas naheen thaa, usane buss vahee kiya joe usey sahee lagaa.	lekin uska background thoda spoiled hein, kyon ki voh competition mein cheat kiy.. lekin unka action ka consequences nahi realize huva, bas kya use right laga voh kar baita
I feel like a lot of kids need that message these days.	mujhe lagata haye kii aajkal bahut saare bachchon koo usa sandesh kii zaroorat haye.	I feel aajkal bahut se kids ko is meesage ki bahut jarurat hai.
You've got a good point there about the cheating.	dhokhadhadi key baare mein aapke paas ack achchi baat haye.	tumhare pass bahut badhiya point hai cheating ke baare men.
And you have a good point there about kids needing that message!	aur aapke paas yeh achchi baat haye kii bachchon koo usa sandesh kii aavashyakta haye!	aur aapke pass yah badhiya point hai is message ka kids ki jaruraton ke baare me.
I like that they had to work hard together too, so it didn't feel like so much of a struggle. Because Mike and Sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up the corporate ladder	mujhe achchha lagaa kii unhein saath milkar bhee kadee mehnat karni padee, isaliye itna sangharsh naheen lagaa. kyonki mike aur sulee koo corporate seedhi parr aage badhane key usa sangharsh mein ack-dusare koo saajha karna thaa	maine ye baat like ki ki unko sath milke hard work karna pada, so aisa feel nahi aaya ki ye koi jyada struggle tha. Because Mike and Sully ko ek dusre ke sath the unka struggle share karne me jab wo corporate  ladder chadh rahe the.

I do, I thought Billy did a good job as Mike	main kartaa huun, mujhe lagaa kii billy ney mike key roop mein achchha kaam kiya haye	HAAN, MUJE LAGA BILLY NE MIKE KE TARAH ACHE JOB KIYA HEIN
Yeah Billy Crystal is great. Who is your favorite character?	haan billy chrystal mahaan haye. aapka pasandida charitra kaun haye?	HAAN, BILLY CRYSTAL THO GREAT HEIN.. AAPKA FAVORITE CHARACTER KOUN HEIN?
Mike was. Monster U is cute and funny and the animation, though not exactly inspired, has a lot of color.	mike thaa. monster yuu pyaara aur mazedaar haye aur animation, halanki bilkul prerit naheen haye, isamen bahut saare rung hain.	MIKE YAR... MONSTER U THO FUNNY AUR CUTE HEIN, KAAFI ANIMATION BHI HEIN, JO MUJE INSPIRED NAHI HOTA LEKIN USME KAAFI COLOR HEIN
I really liked all the comedy in it. And the music	mujhe isaki saaree comedy bahut pasand aaee. aur sangeet	MUJE COMEDY PASAND AAYA, AUR USKA MUSIC BHI
The comedy is true to the spirit of Monsters Inc and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over old ground. The music hit all the right notes I think	comedy monsters ink kii bhavna key anuroop haye aur usake swar seey mell khaati haye, lekin kabhi bhee purani sthiti koo badalane mein santusht naheen dikhi. mujhe lagata haye kii sangeet ney sabhi sahee swaron koo hitt kiya	COMEDY THO TRUE SE US SPIRIT KA MONSTERS HEIN, KAAFI TONE SE MATCH KIYA JO KABHI OLD GROUND MEIN TURN NAHI HOTA.. MUSIC THO SAHI NOTES HEIN,
I agree, it was a very safe bet for Pixar with how they presented it.	main sahmat huun, jiss tarah seey unhone ise prastut kiya, pixer key liye yeh ack bahut hii surakshit shart thee.	MEIN MAANTHA HOON, YEH PIXAR KA SAFE BET HEIN, JIS TARAH VOH PRESENT KIYE
Superstar actors doing voice acting is always going to make money, though.	haalaanki, voyce acting karane vaale superstar abhineta hamesha paisa kamaane vaale hotey hain.	Superstar actors ka voice acting karna is always going to make money, though.
I agree, it has enough stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a good result.	main sahmat huun, isamen cuteness kii tatkaal charcha khatm hoe jaane key baad lambe samay taka kalpana koo pareshan karane key liye paryaapt samagri haye. maatr prekwal key liye, yeh ack achchha parinam haye.	Main agree karta hun, isme kafi stuff jo cuteness ke immediate buzz ke melt hone ke baad imagination ko haunt karegi. mere prequel ke liye ye acha result hai.
I liked the whole fraternity aspect of it, very tongue in cheek.	mujhe iska puuraa bhaichara vaalaa pahalu bahut pasand aayaa, bahut zor seey gaal bajaana.	mujhe iska saara fraternity aspect acha laga, bohat tongue in cheek.
Yes, it was a refreshing outlook on the series as a whole and provided a nice background for the characters.	haan, yeh poori shrinkhala parr ack taazaa drishtikon thaa aur paatron key liye ack achchi prishthabhoomi pradaan kii.	Han, ye ek as a whole series pe refreshing outlook tha aur characters ke liye nice background provide karti hai
I thought the scene of Mike at 7 years old was a good call-back too.	mujhe lagaa kii 7 saal kii umr mein mike kaa drishya bhee ack achchha coll-back thaa.	mujhe laga Mike ka 7 years old ka scene bhi acha call-back tha
I agree, I liked when they show Mike's background story of why he became a scarer. I always wondered why he chose to do that	main sahmat huun, mujhe achchha lagaa jaba unhone mike kii prishthabhoomi kii kahani dikhaai kii vaha kyon daravana bunn gayaa. mujhe hamesha ashcharya hotaa thaa kii usane aisaa karna kyon chunaa	I agree, mujhe acha laga jab unhone Mike ki background story dikhayi ki wo scarer kyun ban gaya. Main hamesha sochta hu usne aisa karna kyun chose kia.
I also like how they show the friendship between Mike and Sully develop	mujhe yeh bhee pasand haye kii way kaise dikhaate hain kii mike aur sulee key beach dosti vikasit hui haye	mujhe ye bhi acha laga ki kaise unhone Mike aur Sully ki friendship develop hote dikhaya
Yeah I never thought of Sully as the cool guy iike that	haan, maine sulee koo usa tarah kaa achchha ladka kabhi naheen socha thaa	Haan maine kabhi nahi socha Sully ko is tarah cool guy
I didn't know Sully had such a pretentious  background compared to other characters. It explains why only he was accepted into Roar Omega Roar.	mujhe naheen pataa thaa kii anya kirdaaron kii tulana mein sulee kii prishthabhoomi itani dikhaavati haye. yeh bataata haye kii kewal unhein hii ror omega ror mein kyon sweekar kiya gayaa.	main nahi janta Sully ka baaki characters ke comparison mein itna pretentious background tha. Isse samajh aata hi sirf wahi kyun Roar Omega Roar mein accept huya.
True, and it does do a good job of showing how both characters are flawed.	sach haye, aur yeh yeh dikhaane kaa achchha kaam kartaa haye kii kaise donon paatr trutipurna hain.	Sach, aur ye ye dikhane ka acha kaam karti hai ki dono characters flawed hain.
I thought the whole Scare Games plot was a fairly good one too, kept it interesting.	mujhe lagaa kii sampoorn scare games kaa kathaanak bhee kaafee achchha thaa, ise dilchasp banaae rakhaa.	mery khyal k mutabiq tamam khofnak game ka plot kafi achaa bhi tha, bht dilchasp rakha
I agree, I like that they didn't try to make them perfect.	main sahmat huun, mujhe yeh pasand haye kii unhone unhein poorn banaane kii koshish naheen kii.	mai manta hun, mjhy acha laga k unhun ne unko oerfect banany ki koshish nai ki
Yes! And so much was at stake for them in that game as well	haan! aur usa khel mein bhee unake liye bahut kuchh daanv parr lagaa thaa	Han, aur unky lia bht kuch us game mai dao per bhi laga hua tha
It would decide if they could be renerolled or not. How do you feel about how Sully cheated?	isamen taya kiya jaayega kii unaka dobara namankan kiya jaa sakata haye yaa naheen. aap kaisa mahsoos karate hain kii sulee ney kaise dhokha diyaa?	ye faisla krega k kia wo reenrolled ho skty hain ya nai. apko kaisa laga k sully ne kaisy cheat kia
I thought it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment.	maine socha kii yeh apariharya mein deree curr rhaa haye aur unhein upalabdhi kaa jhoothaa ehsas dilaa rhaa haye.	mery mutabiq ye anhooni ko sirf delay ker rha tha aur unhy accomplishment ki aik jhooti tasalli de rha tha
I agree, I felt bad for Mike who thought he succeeded on his own terms but instead was helped to win	main sahmat huun, mujhe mike key liye buraa lagaa jisane socha kii vaha apani sharton parr safal huaa lekin isake bajaay usey jeetane mein madad kii gaee	mai manta hun, mjhy Mike k lia bura laga jo soch rha tha k wo khud se kamyaab hua jabky usy jeetny mai madad di gaye

Use bahut bad luck rahta hai par par ek limit cross ho jati hai jab uske co worker ko uske pahle promotion diya jata hai.
He then starts his complaints to God who ends up responding with the proposition that gives him his powers	phir vaha bhagwan seey apani shikaayaten shuru kartaa haye, joe anta mein usa prastaav key saath jawab detaa haye joe usey usaki shaktiyan detaa haye	Wo iske baad God se complain karta, God uski baat par respond karte hai aur ek option dete hai jisse uske pass power aa jati hai
So its like walk in someone else's shoes to see what they have to deal with.	tou yeh kissy aur key sthaan parr chalkar yeh dekhane jaisa haye kii unhein kiss cheez seey nipatna haye.	So iska matlab ki kisi aur ke shoes pahan kar chalo taki pata lage ki kaisa lagta hai.
More as in "why God leaves some prayers unanswered"	jaise kii "ishwar kuchh prarthanaon koo anuttarit kyon chhod detaa haye"	jyada hone se pata nai kyun bhagwan ne kuch prathnaon ko unsunna kar diya

Some of the critical responses to Iron Man were: "impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG"	iron maine key liye kuchh aalochanatmak pratikriyaen theen: "prabhaavshaali sett aur yantriki joe apekshaakrit nirbaadh cg key saath aasaani seey juda jaate hain"	Iron man ke baare mein kuch critical response aise the: "shaandar sets aur mechanics jo smoothly combine karte hain relatively seamless CG se"
What happens in this movie	iss movie mein kyaa hotaa haye	is movie mein kya hota hai

Tony escapes by building a metal suit out of scrap while also pretending to build a missile for the terrorist group. The metal suit is his prototypical Iron Man suit.	tonny kabaad seey ack dhaatu kaa soot banaakar bhaag jaataa haye aur saath hii aatankvaadi samooh key liye missile banaane kaa naatak bhee kartaa haye. metal soot unaka prototypic iron maine soot haye.	tony escape kar jaata hain ek metal suit se jo scrap se bani thi, yeh pretend karte huye ki woh terrorist group ke liye missile bana raha hai. yeh metal suit uski prototypical Iron Man suit hai

Hello!	namaste!	Hello!
hey, what's up	kyaa chala rhaa haye	Hey, kya chal rha hai
have you watched la la land before?	kyaa aapane pahale laa laa laind dekhi haye?	Kya tune la la land pehle dekhi hai?
Yes. I really appreciated how much thought went into the movie's title. I think it's really cool how it refers to Los Angeles, music, and having your head in the clouds all at once. It's really spectacular how they summed up so many elements of the movie in such a short title	haan. main vaastav mein isaki sarahana kartaa huun kii film key sheershak parr kitna vichaar kiya gayaa. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh vaastav mein achchha haye kii yeh kaise loss angils, sangeet aur ack hii samay mein aapka sir baadalon mein honey koo sandarbhit kartaa haye. yeh vaastav mein shandar haye kii kaise unhone itane chhote sheershak mein film key itane saare tatvon koo sankshep mein prastut kiya	Han, maine bht appreciate kiya ki movie ke name ke baare mein kitna socha gya hai. Mujhe achha lga ki kaise ye ek hi baar mein Los Angeles, music, or badalon mein sir dene ke baare mein btata hai. Yeh sach mein bahut badiya hai ki kaise movie ke chhote se titile mein itne saare elements ko pura kiya gya hai.
Have you seen it?	kyaa aapane ise dekhaa haye?	Kya tune dekhi hai?
yep -  i watched it because critics seemed to like it	haan - maine ise dekhaa kyonki alochakon koo yeh pasand aayaa	han - Maine dekhi kyunki critics ko ye achhi lagi
I agree with most of the critics in the paper	main akhbar key adhikansh alochakon seey sahmat huun	Main jyadatar paper ke sabhi critics ke saath agree krta huin
Yes. I especially agree with the review that La La Land is successful at showing the hardships that are involved with chasing a dream	haan. main vishesh roop seey iss sameeksha seey sahmat huun kii laa laa laind ack sapane kaa peechha karane mein aaney vaali kathinaaiyon koo dikhaane mein safal haye	Han. Main sabse jyada iss review ke saath agree krta huin ki La La land successful rahi hai sapnon ko pura krne ke liye kiye gye hardships ko dikhane mein.
I disagree with the two reviews that the film is dull and that the middle was boring. I really found the entire movie to be enthralling.	main una dou sameekshaon seey asahmat huun kii film neeras haye aur beach kaa bhaag ubaau haye. mujhe sachmuch poori film romanchkari luggy.	Mein unn do reviews se asahmat hu jinhone likha tha ki film dull hai aur beech ka part boring hai. Mujhe sach mein poori film enthralling lagi.
yep, i agree with you - i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack, since they're not singers	haan, main aapse sahmat huun - mujhe vishvaas haye kii hamein emma stone aur rayan gosling koo thodaa dheela karna hoga, kyonki way gaayak naheen hain	han, mein aapse sehmat hu - mein ye maanta hu ki humko emma stone aur ryan gosling ko kuch slack kaatna chahiye kyuki wo singers nahi hain
Agreed. I really liked the scene where Sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing Christmas music only.	maan gayaa. mujhe vaastav mein vaha drishya pasand aayaa jahaan sebastian jaiz sangeet mein sudhaar kartaa haye jabaki usey kewal chrismus sangeet bajaana hotaa haye.	Han, meine mana. Mujhe wah scene bohat achha laga jahan Sebastian jazz music improv karta hai jabki usko sirf Christmas music play karna chahiye.
It was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after I watched the movie	yeh una drishyon mein seey ack thaa joe film dekhane key baad vaastav mein merey saath chipak gayaa	Ye unmein se ek scene tha jo film dekhne k baad bhi mere sath chipka reh gaya.
would you do that, if you were in his position?	yadi aap usaki jagah parr hotey tou kyaa aap aisaa karate?	tum kya karte, agar tum uski position mein hote?
I'm not sure. I liked how that was when Mia first heard Sebastian sing and was truly moved by it. I think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship	mujhe yakeen naheen haye. mujhe yeh pasand aayaa kii jaba miya ney pahali baar sebestian koo gaate hue sunaa thaa aur vaha vaastav mein usase prabhaavit hui thee. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh unake rishte koo shuru karane kaa dilchasp tarika thaa	Mujhe sure nahi hu. Mujhe yah pasand aaya ki jab Mia ne pehli baar Sebastian ko gaate huye suna aur wo sach mein uss se move ho gayi. Mujhe lagta hai ye unki relationship ko start karne a interesting way tha.
yeah, it was just sad how he brushed her off, since things could've been different	haan, yeh bahut dukhad thaa kii usane usey kaise nazarandaj curr diyaa, kyonki cheejen alag hoe sakati theen	han, ye sad tha ki usne usko brush off kar dia, warna baatein kuch alag hi hoti
I do like how the next time Mia sees Sebastian he is also singing. I also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he would hate to sing	mujhe yeh pasand haye kii agali baar jaba miya sebastian koo dekhti haye tou vaha bhee gaa rhaa hotaa haye. mujhe yeh bhee pasand aayaa kii kaise usane ack gaane kaa anurodh karke usey chidhaaya, jisake baare mein usey pataa thaa kii usey gaane seey nafrat hogi	Mujhe ye achha laga ki jab next time Mia ne Sebastian ko dekha wo bhi gana ga raha hai.  Mujhe ye bhi pasand aaya ki usne usko ek aisa gana request karke chidhaya kyuki usko pata tha ki usko wo gana gana achha nahi lagega
do you usually watch musicals?	kyaa aap aamtaur parr sangeet dekhate hain?	Tum usually musicals dekhte ho?
Occasionally. I also enjoyed the development of Sebastian and Mia's relationship, such as when Mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because Sebastian suggests it to her. I feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship	kabhi-kabhi. maine sebastian aur miya key rishte key vikas kaa bhee anand liya, jaise kii jaba miya akele hii ack naatak likhana shuru karane kaa faisala karati haye kyonki sebastian usey iska sujhaav detaa haye. mujhe aisaa lagata haye kii jaba way donon kissy rishte mein bandhate hain tou vaastav mein ack vyakti key roop mein vikasit hotey hain	kabhi kabhi.  Mujhe bhi Sebastian aur Mia ki relationship ka development achha laga, jaise jab Mia decide karti hai ki ab wo akele hi play karegi kyuki Sebastian ne usko aisa suggest kia. Mujhe laga ki wo dono bohat grow karte hain as individuals jab wo relationship mein aa jate hain
I enjoyed that part too, since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams	maine usa hisse kaa bhee anand liya, kyonki isase yeh bhee pataa chalata haye kii way donon apane sapnon koo hassil karane key liye kitni mehnat curr rahey hain	maine woh part bhi enjoy kiya, kyon ki yeh dikhata hai kitna hard ye donon kaam kar rahen hain apne dreams achieve karne ke liye
they both want to become successful in their separate areas, but they have to struggle a lot	way donon apane-apane kshetron mein safal honah chaahte hain, lekin unhein kaafee sangharsh karna padata haye	donon chahte hain ki successful banen apne seperate ares mein, lekin bahut struggle karna padega
Right. I feel like the review that mentions the cruelty that's involved in following your dreams really sums it up. The film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big	sahee. mujhe aisaa lagata haye kii jiss sameeksha mein aapke sapnon koo puuraa karane mein shamil krurta kaa ullekh kiya gayaa haye, vaha vaastav mein iska saar prastut karati haye. film yeh dikhaane seey naheen darti kii ise badaa banaane mein kitni mehnat aur kathinaaee shamil haye	Right. lagta hai review jo cruelty ko mention karta hai dreams ko follow karten hai sum karta hai.film afraid nahin karta hai ki kitna hard work aur hardship involve karta hai bada hasil karne ke liye
i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keith's offer	maine yeh bhee socha kii sebastian key liye keath kaa prastaav sweekar karna kathin thaa	mujhe bhi laga ki sebastian keo keith ka offer difficult laga
i mean, he gets paid, but it's not something he wants to do. This happens in life a lot	meraa matlab haye, usey bhugtan milata haye, lekin yeh aisaa kuchh naheen haye joe vaha karna chaahata haye. jeevan mein aisaa bahut hotaa haye	mera matlab hai, use payment milta hai lekin woh hai nahin karna chahta hai.  ye bahut hota hai life mein
I agree. It must be hard to do something you're not passionate about- especially when it's something you must do in order to one day live out your dreams	main sahmat huun. aisaa kuchh karna kathin hoga jisake baare mein aap bhavuk naa houn- khaskar taba jaba yeh kuchh aisaa hoe joe aapako ack dinn apane sapnon koo puuraa karane key liye karna hii hoga.	main agree karta hoon. hard lagta hoga kuch karne kojab tum passionate nahin hoge- especially jab tumhe kuch karna hoga tumhe ek din live karna hai dreams ke liye
What did you think of the scene when Mia and Sebastian get into a fight about Mia thinking Sebastian is giving up on his dreams?	aapane usa drishya key baare mein kyaa socha jaba miya aur sebastian key beach iss baat koo laker jhagada hoe gayaa kii miya soch rahee thee kii sebastian apane sapnon koo chhod rhaa haye?	kya laga tumhe woh scene jab Mia or Sebastian fight karne lage jo Mia soch rahi thi Sebastian drams ko chod raha hai?
it was definitely well acted, and i sympathize with both of them	yeh nishchit roop seey achchha abhinay thaa aur mujhe una donon key prati sahaanubhooti haye	usme ekdum acchi acting thi, lekin sympathize karta hoon donon se
but i think sebastian was harsh when he said that mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful	lekin mujhe lagata haye kii sebestian taba kathor they jaba unhone kahaa kii asafal honey parr miya unhein adhik pasand karati haye	mujhe lagta hai sebastian harsh tha jab usne mia se kaha ki woh use aur pasand karta tha jab woh unsucessful tha
It truly was heartbreaking when Mia moved back home to Nevada	yeh sachmuch hridayavidaarak thaa jaba miya apane ghar nevada vaapas chully gaee	truly woh heartbreaking thi jab Mia vapas Nevada ghar mein gayi
i feel he didn't want to hear the truth, because he was really giving up on his dreams	mujhe lagata haye kii vaha sach naheen sunana chaahata thaa, kyonki vaha vaastav mein apane sapnon koo tyag rhaa thaa	muje lagtha hein ki voh sach jaan ne mein hiskis hein, kyon ki voh apna dream ko give up karta hein
it really was sad	yeh sachmuch dukhad thaa	voh toh bura huva
I agree. It was also a very unpredictable plot twist. I did not see it coming at all	main sahmat huun. yeh bhee ack behad apratyaashit kathaanak modd thaa. maine ise bilkul bhee aatey naheen dekhaa	mein maantha hoon. voh toh unpredictable plot twist tha. muje toh patha hi nahi chala ki voh aap raha hein
would you say that was the low point in the movie?	kyaa aap kahenge kii yeh film kaa nimn bindu thaa?	kya tuje aisa laga ki voh low point ka movie hein?
Yes but I wouldn't say any part of the movie "sagged badly" as one review claims	haan, lekin main yeh naheen kahoonga kii film kaa koee bhee hissa "buri tarah seey dheela" hoe gayaa haye, jaisa kii ack sameeksha mein daavaa kiya gayaa haye	haan, lakin  muje lag raha hai ki koi sagged badly ko review karega
i agree - overall, i would recommend the movie to a friend	main sahmat huun - kull milakar, main ack dost koo film kii sifarish karunga	haan maantha hoon, overall mein toh apni friend ko is movie ko recommend karunga
I agree. As another review points out it was a "genuinely romantic comedy", which I completely agree with because I feel as though Sebastian and Mia's relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in movies. I appreciated the realness of their relationship	main sahmat huun. jaisa kii ack anya sameeksha bataati haye kii yeh ack "vaastav mein romantic comedy" thee, jisase main poori tarah sahmat huun kyonki mujhe lagata haye kii sebastian aur miya kaa rishta utana ghisa-pitaa naheen thaa jitna kii kaee prem kahaaniyan filmon mein hoti hain. maine unake rishte kii vaastaviktaa kii sarahana kii	mein bhi. toh dusra review point mein toh voh "genuinely romantic comedy" bola tha , jo mein completely agree karunga kyon ki muje lagtha hei ki Sebastian aur Mia ka relationship toh cliche nahi hein jo love stories mein huva hota hein. lakin voh relationship toh mein realness se appreciate karunga
yes, that was one thing i loved about the movie - while it was sad, it was not a cliche ending	haan, yeh ack baat thee joe mujhe film key baare mein pasand aaee - halanki yeh dukhad thee, lekin iska anta ghisa-pitaa naheen thaa	haan, yehi toh muje is movie se pasand aaya- voh toh sad tha lakin cliche ending bana
I agree. I think Damien Chazelle really did a good job directing the film.	main sahmat huun. mujhe lagata haye kii damien chazelle ney film kaa nirdeshan karate hue vaastav mein achchha kaam kiya haye.	mein maantha hoon. muje lagtha ki Damien Chazelle ne is film ko ache directing ki
i'm curious, are you an ai	main utsuk huun, kyaa aap aii hain?	mein toh curious hoon, aap?
if so, i was completely fooled	yadi haan, tou main poori tarah seey moorkh thaa	agar aisa hai, to mujhe poori tarah se fool bnaya gaya
I am not!	main naheen huun!	main nahi hu
But I really was surprised that someone reviewed Sebastian as a "jazz snob" because I did not get that vibe at all	lekin main vaastav mein aashcharyachakit thaa kii kissy ney sebastian kii sameeksha "jaiz snobe" key roop mein kii kyonki mujhe vaha bhavna bilkul bhee naheen millie	lakin main bilkul surprise hu ki kisi ne Sebastian ko as a "jazz snob " reviewed kiya kyun ki mujhe wo vibe bilkul bhi nahi mili
yeah, i disagreed with that characterization, but i can see why someone might say that.	haan, main usa charitra-chitran seey asahmat huun, lekin main samajh sakata huun kii koee aisaa kyon kaha sakata haye.	haan, main disagree hu us characterization ke stah, lakin main dekh saktu hu kyun kuch log aisa keh sakte hai
he is a purist, or whatever they called it in the film	vaha ack shuddhatavadi haye, yaa joe kuchh bhee unhone ise film mein kahaa haye	wo ek purist hai, ya phir jo kuch bhi unhone use film main bulaya
I also really didn't think Mia's character lacked depth. I think she was a rather round character, especially with the large amount of independence she possessed. It took a lot of courage for her to move back to Nevada	mujhe vaastav mein yeh bhee naheen lagaa kii miya key charitra mein gehrai kii kamee haye. mujhe lagata haye kii vaha ack goal charitra vaali mahila thee, khaskar badee matra mein swatantrata key kaaran. nevada vaapas jaane key liye usey bahut saahas karna padaa	mujuhe bhi aisa nahi lagta ki Mia ka character depth main lack karta hai. Mujhe lagta hai balki wo round character thi, especially usne  large amount of independence ke sath usne possessed kiya. Use bahut zada courage lagi hogi wapas Neveda ke main wapas jane ke liye
yes, i thought her character was pretty nuanced, but i'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to Nevada. After the play didn't go well, I think that was her only option	haan, mujhe lagaa kii uska charitra kaafee sookshm thaa, lekin mujhe yakeen naheen haye kii nevada vaapas jaanaa usake liye sahsi hoga. naatak achchha naheen chalane key baad, mujhe lagata haye kii yahee uska ekmatra vikalp thaa	hann, mujhe lagta hai ki uska character pretty nuanced tha, lakin main sure nahi hu ki ye uke liye courageous hai wapas Nevada move hona. play ke sahi na jane ke baad, mujhe lagta hai uske paas keval yahi option tha.
*about it	*isake baare mein	iske bare main
I suppose you have a point. I just think she was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films as she didn't cling on to Sebastian when things didn't work out for her.	mujhe lagata haye aapke paas koee baat haye. mujhe buss yahee lagata haye kii vaha filmon mein chitrit ausat mahila seey adhik swatantra thee kyonki jaba cheejen usake liye kaam naheen karati theen tou vaha sebastian seey chipki naheen rahati thee.	mujhe lagta hai ki apke paas pont hai. Mian sochta hu ki wo zada independent thi average woman se jaisa ki film main portray kiya gaya kyunki jab chieze uske liye work out nahi ki wo Sebastian ke upar chipki nahi
although I wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams	haalaanki main chaahata huun kii way apane sapnon koo hassil karane seey pahale sulah curr lein	halaki main wish karta hu ki vain apne dreams ko achieve karne se pehle reconcile kare
the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad	anta mein vaha ansh jisane dikhaaya kii vaastav mein mujhe dukhi karane vaalaa kyaa hoe sakata thaa	end me jo dikhaya ki actually me kya ban sakta hai usse maine kafi sad feel kiya
I agree! It was very sad but also, as one reviewer puts it quite "bittersweet." I wasn't sure how to feel at the end.	main sahmat huun! yeh bahut dukhad thaa, lekin saath hii, jaisa kii ack sameekshak ise kaafee "kadwa-meethaa" bhee kahate hain. main nishchit naheen thaa kii anta mein kaisa mahsoos karuungaa.	I agree! Yah bahut sad tha but also ek reviewer ne jaise bataya ki yah quite bittersweet ha. Mai sure hi nahi tha ki ant me mai kya feel karu.
It was nice discussing the film with you! Have a great day!	aapke saath film parr charcha karke achchha lagaa! aapka dinn achchha rahey!	aapke sath film discuss karke achcha laga! Hava a great day!
you guys have a pretty good ai system	aap logon key paas bahut achchha ai system haye	aap logon ke pass ek badhiya ai system hai
i was actually completely fooled	main vaastav mein poori tarah seey moorkh thaa	completely fool ban gaya tha actually me

Hello	namaste	Hello
Hello	namaste	Hello
I just watched Batman vs. Superman, have you seen it yet?	maine abhee-abhee batman banaam superman dekhaa haye, kyaa aapane ise abhee taka dekhaa haye?	Maine abhi Batman vs. Superman dekhi, Aapne dekhi hai abhi tak?
No I haven't	naheen, maine naheen kiya	No, Maine nahi dekhi
It's the first movie like this with Batman and Superman together.	batman aur superman kii ack saath iss tarah kii yeh pahali film haye.	Yeh Batman aur Superman ki sathme aisi pehli movie hai.
That sounds good	yeh achchha rahega	Sunkar achha laga
Batman is played by Ben Affleck.  He gets tricked into fighting Superman.	batman kaa kirdar bayne affleck ney nibhaaya haye.  usey superman seey ladane key liye dhokha diyaa jaataa haye.	Batman ka role Ben Affleck ne nibhaya hai. Use Superman ke sathme ladai karne ka trick milka hai.
Who plays Superman?	superman kii bhoomika kaun kartaa haye?	Superman ka role kisne nibhata hai?
Henry Cavill.  Wonder Wo man is in it too.	heinry nuktachini. isamen wonder women bhee haye.	Henry Cavill. Wonder kaun sath me hoga.
I like him, he's a good actor.	mujhe vaha pasand haye, vaha ack achchha abhineta haye.	Mujhe wo pasand hai, Wo ek achha actor hai.
I love Wonder Woman. Who plays Wonder Woman?	mujhe wonder women bahut pasand haye. wonder women kaa kirdar kaun nibhaayega?	muje wonder woman pasand hai.wonder woman kaun play kar raha hai
I'm not sure of her name, b ut Laurence Fishburne and Holly Hunter are in it too.	main usake naam key baare mein nishchit naheen huun, lekin laurence fishburn aur hollie hunter bhee isamen hain.	mai uske nam par sure nahi hu.lekin  sayad Laurence Fishburne aur HolLy Hunter  ho sakta hai
I like both of them. The movie sounds good. How long is it?	mujhe dono achche lagey. film achchi lagati haye. yeh kitna lamba haye?	mai un dono ko pasand karta hu movie ki sound achi hai  aur kitna der
It's 153 minutes so it's fairly long.  There's a part where Bruce Wayne/Batman seeks out kryptonite in the Indian Ocean as a deterrent.	yeh 153 minut kaa haye isaliye yeh kaafee lamba haye.  vahaan ack hissa haye jahaan broose wein/batman ack nivaarak key roop mein hind mahasagar mein cryptonite kii talash kartaa haye.	ye 153 minut so long .yaha yek hissa jaha way/batmanne indian ocean me krytonite paya
It didn't get very good critics scores.	ise sameekshakon key bahut achche ank naheen mille.	ishe bahut acha critic score nahi mile
That is a long movie. I enjoy long movies, especially in the theaters. It sounds interesting. What did the critics have to say about it?	vaha ack lambi film haye. mujhe lambi filmein pasand hain, khaskar theatre mein. yeh dilchasp lagata haye. alochakon kaa iss baare mein kyaa kahana haye?	yah yek lambi moive hai ,muje lambi moive pasand hai khaskar theater me ,iski sounds majedar hai.kritic ne iske bare me kya kaha
CinemaScore graded it as a B, Rotten Tomatoes 4.9/10 and Metacritic Score was 44/100. One of the critics said it wasn't as good as Dark Knight but it was better than Man of Stee.	cinemascore ney ise bee, rotten tomatose 4.9/10 aur metacritic score 44/100 key roop mein vargeekrit kiya. alochakon mein seey ack ney kahaa kii yeh dark night jitani achchi naheen thee lekin maine off stee seey behtar thee.	cinema score ne ishe b grad diya,rotten tomatoes ne 4.9/10 aur  Metacritic  ne 44/100,yek critic ne khayah ki ye dark night jaisi achi nahi par man of steel se achi hai
Steel.	ispat.	istel
Wow. Those are really low scores! I am surprised at that. Usually these types of movies are popular and do well.	bahut khoob. way vaastav mein cumm ank hain! main iss parr aashcharyachakit huun. aamtaur parr iss prakaar kii filmein lokpriya hoti hain aur achchha pradarshan karati hain.	wah ye to vastav me kam score hai.vaise jayadatar eshi moives popular hoti hai aur acha pradsan karti  hai
Yeah, agreed.  In one part of the movie, Superman's mom gets kidnapped and the kidnapper demands he kill Batman for his Mom's release.	haan, sahmat huun.  film key ack bhaag mein, superman kii maan kaa apaharan hoe jaataa haye aur apaharankarta apani maan kii rihaai key liye batman koo maarne kii maang kartaa haye.	ha mai manta hu moive ke yek hisse maisuperman ki mom kidnap huyi aur kidnaper ne kaha ki vo uski maa ke badle batman ko marega
And what happens once his mom is released?	aur ack baar jaba usaki maan riha hoe jaayegi tou kyaa hoga?	aur phir uski mom release hone k baad kya hoga?
She isn't released that way, because Batman realizes right before he kills Superman that they are both being tricked.  Batman ends up rescuing Superman's Mom, and Superman goes after the kidnapper.	usey iss tarah seey riha naheen kiya jaataa haye, kyonki superman koo maarne seey thheek pahale batman koo ehsas hotaa haye kii una donon koo dhokha diyaa jaa rhaa haye.  batman antatah superman kii maan koo bachaa letaa haye, aur superman apaharankarta key peechhe chalaa jaataa haye.	Wo waise release nahi hoti hai, kyuki Batman Superman ko maarne se theek pahle samjh jata hai k dono ko trick kiya gaya hai. Batman Superman ki mom ko bachata hai aur superman kidnapper k peeche jata hai
Does Superman have a fight with kidnapper?	kyaa superman kaa apaharankarta seey jhagada huaa haye?	Kya Superman kidnapper k sath ladta hai?
And who wins	aur kaun jeetata haye	Kaun jeetta hai?
Yes, Superman confronts the kidnapper, whose name is Luthor, played by Jesse Eisenberg, on the Kryptonian scout ship.	haan, superman cryptonian scout jahaaj parr apaharankarta kaa saamana kartaa haye, jiska naam luther haye, jiska kirdar jessy easenberg ney nibhaaya haye.	Haan, Superman kidnapper ko confront karta hai, jiska naam Luthor hai, Jesse Eisenberg ne play kiya hia, Kryptonian scout ship pe
That sounds exciting. Is Wonder Woman in the movie a lot?	yeh romanchak lagata haye. kyaa film mein wonder women bahut haye?	Kaafi exciting sound karta hai. Kya is movie me Wonder Woman kaafi hai ?
Luthor gets arrested and then Batman goes to visit him in prison.  I don't want to tell you the outcome of the fight because I don't want to ruin the ending.  No, Wonder Woman doesn't have a very big part.	luther koo giraftar curr liya jaataa haye aur phir batman jail mein usase milane jaataa haye.  main aapako ladaai kaa parinam naheen bataana chaahata kyonki main anta koo barbad naheen karna chaahata.  naheen, wonder women kaa bahut badaa hissa naheen haye.	Luthor arrest hojata hai phir Batman usse visit karne jail me jata hai. Main tumhe fight ka outcome nahi batana chahta kyuki main ending ruin nahi karna chahta. No, Wonder Woman ka bahut bada part nahi hai
I love Wonder Woman! Yes, don't give away the outcome because I want to see it!	mujhe wonder women pasand haye! haan, parinam koo mutt chhodo kyonki main ise dekhana chaahata huun!	Mujhe Wonder Woman bahut pasand hai! Haan, outcome mat batao kyuki mujhe ye movie dekhni hai
I think you'll really like it.  I don't always believe the critics, you never know what else is going on with them.	mujhe lagata haye aapako yeh sachmuch pasand aayega.  main hamesha alochakon parr vishvaas naheen kartaa, aap kabhi naheen jaanate kii unake saath aur kyaa hoe rhaa haye.	Mujhe lagta hai tumhe bahut pasand aayegi. Main critics ki baat hamesha nahi maanta, pata nahi kya chal rah hai unke sath.
I think I would too. I try not to listen too much to them either. I have seen some really good movies that the critics just rip to shreds.	mujhe lagata haye main bhee aisaa karunga. main bhee koshish kartaa huun kii unaki baat jyada naa sunoon. maine kuchh bahut achchi filmein dekhi hain jinaki sameekshakon ney dhajjiyan udaa dee hain.	Mujhe bhi wahi lagta hai. Main bhi unki jyada baat nahi sunta. Maine kaafi bahut acchi movies dekhi hai jiski critics ne dhajjia uda di thi.
There may have been a movie coming out the same weekend they were friends with the director or something loke that.	hoe sakata haye kii usee saptah key anta mein koee film aaa rahee hoe, nirdeshak key saath unaki dosti hoe yaa aisaa hii kuchh.	Ho sakata hai usee veekend koee philm aa rahee ho jisamen ve nirdeshak se dostee kar rahe the ya kuchh aisa kar rahe the.

Hi	namaste	hi
So the movie we're talking about is Inception	tou humm jiss film kii baat curr rahey hain uska naam haye inception	so ham jis movie ke bare me baat kar rahe hai wo inception hai

What is the movie about? I haven't seen it	film kiss baare mein haye? maine ise naheen dekhaa haye	yah movie kis bare me hai? maine dekhi nahi hai
The movie is a scientific movie about people who infiltrate the subconscious of individuals and obtain information in the dream world. Basically they enter into someone's dreams to find out information.	yeh film una logon key baare mein ack vaigyaanik film haye joe vyaktiyon key avachetan mein ghuspaith karate hain aur sapnon kii duniya mein jaankaari praapt karate hain. moolatah way jaankaari praapt karane key liye kissy key sapnon mein pravesh karate hain.	Ye movie ek scientific movie hai, un logo ke baar me jo logo ke subconscious mind me infiltrate karte hai aur unke sapno ki duniya se information jutate hai. Basically wo kisi ke sapno me jaakar information nikalte hai.
Seems like an interesting movie, have you watched it?	yeh ack dilchasp film lagati haye, kyaa aapane ise dekhaa haye?	Ye ek interesting moive lag rahi hai, Kya tumne dekhi hai?
Yeah, I've seen it. It's directed by Christopher Nolan if you've heard of him.	haan, maine ise dekhaa haye. yadi aapane christopher nolan key baare mein sunaa haye tou iska nirdeshan kiya haye.	Yeah, maine dekhi hai. Ise Christopher Nolan ne direct kiya hai agar tumne unke bare me suna ho.
I think he also directed The Dark Knight among other things	mujhe lagata haye kii unhone anya cheejon key alawa dha dark night kaa bhee nirdeshan kiya thaa	Mujhe lagta hai unhone The Dark Kninght ko bhi dusri chhejo ke saath direct kiya hai.
Inception also has a rotten tomatoes score of 86% which is really high.	inception mein sadey hue tamataron kaa score bhee 86% haye joe vaastav mein bahut adhik haye.	Inception ka bhi rotten tomatoes par score 86% hai, jo ki kafi high hai.
I love his movies, his a pretty good director, what about the cast of the movie?	mujhe unaki filmein bahut pasand hain, vaha bahut achche nirdeshak hain, film key kalakaron key baare mein kyaa khyaal haye?	Mujhe unki moives pasand hai, wo pretty good director hai, Is movie ke cast ke baare me kya hai?
Leonardo DiCaprio is in it along with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy. All pretty big names.	isamen joseph gorden-levit, elen pays aur tomm hardy key saath leonardo dicaprio hain. sabhi bahut badey naam.	Leonardo DiCaprio bhi isme hai with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page aur Tom hardy ke saath. Sabhi kafi bade naam hai.
Yeah, pretty good actors.	haan, bahut achche abhineta.	Yeah, kafi acche actors.
I like their movies as well	mujhe unaki filmein bhee pasand hain	Mujhe unki bhi moives pasand hai
sounds like a good combination	ack achchha sanyojan lagata haye	Ye ek accha combination sound hota hai.
what about the other movie ratings?	anya film rating key baare mein kyaa?	Doosara movie rating ke bare me kya rai hai
IMDB rates it 8.8/10	imdb ney ise 8.8/10 rating dee haye	IMDB rating me 8.8/10 aatha hai
Which is also pretty high I think	joe merey vichaar seey kaafee adhik haye	woh bahut achha hai ,mujhe eisa lagtha hai
Do you want to know more of the plot or a scene?	kyaa aap kathaanak yaa drishya key baare mein adhik jaanana chaahte hain?	aap kiske bare me jan na chahthe ho , plot or drshya?
Yeah it seems like a high rating, what was your favorite scene?	haan, yeh uchch rating jaisa lagata haye, aapka pasandida drishya kaun saa thaa?	lagtha hai is ka rating achha high ,aap ka pasandeeda drshya kaun si hai
So there's this scene where multiple people are going into a dream. So they need to have someone "kick" them awake at the same time to escape. However, someone gets wounded in the dream  and are almost dying and they get sent into "limbo".	tou yeh vaha drishya haye jahaan kaee loga swapn mein jaa rahey hain. isaliye bachane key liye unhein usee samay kissy koo "laat markar" jagaane kii zaroorat hoti haye. haalaanki, koee vyakti sapane mein ghayal hoe jaataa haye aur lagbhag marane vaalaa hotaa haye aur unhein "amar jeevan" mein bhej diyaa jaataa haye.	scene me bahut sare aadmi swapn me kho jaath hai .koi unko jagane aur bachane ki zaroorat hai. par koi log swapn me ghaayal ho gaye aur marnevale the aur  "limbo" ho jaathe hai.
and what happens if the die in the dream? what are the consequences of this	aur aggar sapane mein marr jaaye tou kyaa hoga? isake kyaa parinam honge	kya hoga agar woh swapn me mar jaathe hai tho? uska natheeja kya hoga
They basically are stuck there until someone can wake them up in the real world. So in the movie, even though it was only a few hours of real time, two of the characters spent fifty years in the "limbo" world, where they had to construct it based on their shared memories.	way mool roop seey taba taka vaheen fanse rahate hain jaba taka koee unhein vaastavik duniya mein naheen jagaa paataa. tou film mein, bhale hii yeh kewal kuchh ghanton kaa vaastavik samay thaa, dou paatron ney "limbo" duniya mein pachas saal bitaaye, jahaan unhein ise apani saajha yaadon key aadhar parr banaana thaa.	woh fass jaathe hai, jab tak unhe koi nai jaga tha aur duniya me le aatha.is movie me bale asli duniya kuch ghante ke liye hai ,par do character pachas saal "limbo" duniya me tha, gayee yaadon par banan pada.
And whats the role of Leonardo Di Caprio in this film?	aur iss film mein leonardo dicaprio kii kyaa bhoomika haye?	Leonardo Di Caprio ka is film me kya role hai?
Im guessing he has the leading role	main anuman lagaa rhaa huun kii unaki pramukh bhoomika haye	mujhe lagtha hai achhi role hai.
Yeah he's the lead actor. His name is Dom Cobb and he specializes in conning secrets from victims in their dreams.	haan, vaha mukhya abhineta hain. uska naam dome cob haye aur vaha peediton seey unake sapnon mein raaz churaane mein mahir haye.	Haan woh lead actor hai. Uska naam hai Dom Cobb aur uska specialization hai conning secrets from victims unke dreams mein.
One more thing about the "limbo" world is that eventually people forget that the world they are in is not real.

I agree. I'm slightly disappointed by the Rotten Tomatoes score. Then again, it is the first time that Pixar has made a prequel film.	main sahmat huun. main rotten tomatose score seey thodaa nirash huun. phir, yeh pahali baar haye kii pixer ney prekwal film banaai haye.	mein mantha hoon. lekin rotten tomatoes ka score se mein disappointment hoon. kyon ki yeh pixar ka first time hein prequel film ko banane mein
Do you typically watch movies like Monster's University?	kyaa aap aamtaur parr monsters university jaisi filmein dekhate hain?	tho aap typically monster university movie ke tarah dekhte hein?
Typically no since i generally like to watch anime. But if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid. Then I usually will make a effort to see it.	aamtaur parr naheen, kyonki main aamtaur parr anime dekhana pasand kartaa huun. lekin aggar franchisee vaha haye joe maine taba dekhi thee jaba main bachcha thaa. phir main aamtaur parr ise dekhane kaa prayas karunga.	typically nahi yar, kyon ki muje anime ko dekhna pasand hein., jab  mein kid tha, jab franchise kar letha. baaki tho mein effort kartha usse dekhne pe
And i agree those scores kinda seem rather low.	aur main sahmat huun kii yeye ank thode cumm prateet hotey hain.	haan, aur unka scores tho low thi rehatha
I understand. Just by glancing at the ratings, do you think you'd make an effort to go see the prequel? Or would the score discourage you from seeing the film?	main samajhata huun. kewal ratings parr nazar daalane seey, kyaa aapako lagata haye kii aap prekwal dekhane kaa prayas karenge? yaa phir score aapako film dekhane seey hatotsaahit karega?	mein understand kartha hoon, lekin ratings tho just glancing hein, tho aap prequel ka dekhne ka effort karenge? ya score ka discourage aap is film nahi dekhenge?
Id still see it despite bad reviews. I generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not. Like if 99% of people say its bad or good. I usually won't follow what i hear. I just go and experience it for myself. And then from there I usually say its cool or  say its bad.	kharab sameekshaon key bavjood bhee main ise dekhunga. main aam taur parr cheezon kaa nirnay swayam karna pasand kartaa huun, yeh dekhane key liye kii mujhe yeh pasand haye yaa naheen. jaise kii 99% loga ise buraa yaa achchha kahate hain. main aamtaur parr joe sunata huun uska paalan naheen kartaa. main buss jaataa huun aur ise apane liye anubhav kartaa huun. aur phir vahaan seey main aamtaur parr kahata huun kii yeh achchha haye yaa kahata haye kii yeh buraa haye.	mein still is bad reviews ko despite kartha. mein apne aap ko decide kartha, muje pasand hein ya nahi. 99% people tho ache ya bura hi bolte. jo mein usually follow nahi kartha. mein apne aap jaatha aur experience kartha, fir mein usually acha ya bad kahatha
Makes sense. I typically only pay attention to the ratings when it's a director who I am familiar with. If I know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings, I usually will wait to hear from friends/family before paying to see it.	samajh mein aataa haye. main aam taur parr rating parr tabhi dhyaan detaa huun jaba vaha koee aisaa nirdeshak hoe jisase main parichit huun. aggar mujhe pataa haye kii unaka kaam aamtaur parr abhootpoorv haye aur kissy vishesh film kii rating bahut kharab haye, tou main aamtaur parr ise dekhane key liye bhugtan karane seey pahale doston/parivaar seey sunane kaa intezar karunga.	make sence. mein typically ratings par attention kartha, koun director familiar aisa. lekin agar mein phenomenal ka work dekhe tho particular movie tho awful rating hei, mein usually family aur friends ke review suntha hoon
Also im a fan of comedy movies. So I'll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes.	main comedy filmon kaa bhee prashansak huun. tou main shayed meams aur chutkulon kaa anand loonga.	mein bhi comedy movies ka fan hoon,. probably muje memes aur jokes ko enjoy kartha
Ya same.	haan vahee.	mein bhi
Comedy movies are always a must see in my book.	merrie kitab mein comedy filmein hamesha jaroor dekhi jaani chaahiye.	comedy movies tho hum book mein hi dekhte
And if im being honest, pixar usually makes good movies so I have good expectations. Illumination movies is what im " iffy" about.	aur aggar main imandar rahuun tou pixer aamtaur parr achchi filmein banaata haye isaliye mujhe achchi ummeeden hain. illumination filmon key baare mein main "iffi" huun.	agar mein honest hoon tho, pixar ko ache movies ko ache hi keheta aur muje unme ache expectations hein. illumination movies tho iffy hote
I love that Monster's University has a fraternity involved. Even more so love it because they call it Roar Omega Roar.	mujhe achchha lagaa kii monster university mein ack biradari shamil haye. yeh aur bhee adhik pasand haye kyonki way ise roar omega roar kahate hain.	muje monster's university paand hein unka fratenity involved hein. muje roar omega roar bhi pasand hein
Mike is 7???? What in the...I never knew that.	mike 7 varsh kaa haye???? isamen kyaa...mujhe yeh kabhi naheen pataa thaa.	mike ka 7??? itna bhi kya hein... mein kabhi suna nahi

ahhh I see well that clears that up.	aaha, main achchi tarah dekh rhaa huun, isase yeh saaf hoe gayaa haye.	ahh, tho mein saari clearsup dekh lunga
Looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities.	aisaa lagata haye kii yeh film kaafee hudd taka cartoon biradari parr adharit haye.	lagtha hein ki movie thoda heavily cartoon fraternities hoga
yep	haan	yap
I find it odd that Pixar has a scene in this movie where Sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores. Doesn't really promote the whole 'fair play' imagine to their age demographic.	mujhe yeh ajib lagata haye kii iss film mein pixer kaa ack drishya haye jahaan sule behtar ank paane key liye machine seey chhedchhaad kartaa haye. vaastav mein unaki umr key jansankhyikiya key liye sampoorn 'nishpaksh khel' kii kalpana koo badhaava naheen detaa haye.	muje odd laga, is movie mein pixar ke liye yek scene hein waha, sulley tampers ka machine badiya score hein.. us age demographic ke liye tho really fair play nahi promote kartha
Oozma Kappa. I can't believe they threw a kappa meme in there.	oozama kappa. main vishvaas naheen curr sakata kii unhone vahaan ack kappa mem fenka haye.	oozma kappa.. muje yakin hi nahi aatha ki voh kaapa ko meme banaye
Every movie with a fraternity/sorority always contains 'Kappa.' Ever notice that?	biradari/sorority vaali pratyek film mein hamesha 'kappa' hotaa haye. kyaa aapane kabhi iss parr dhyaan diyaa haye?	kappa ko saari movies mein fraternity/ sorority hein.. kya aap notice nahi kiya
ya. Its pretty much a dead meme.	haan. yeh kaafee hudd taka ack mrit mem haye.	haan.. dead meme yar

Wonder what CDA stands for in this movie. Clearly, it's some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have?	ashcharya haye kii iss film mein cda kaa kyaa arth haye. spasht roop seey, yeh kissy prakaar kaa pravartak haye, lekin ack rakshas key paas kiss prakaar kaa pravartak hotaa haye?	CDA tho is movie ke liye stand kiye hein.. clearly, is tarah form tho enforcer hein, kis tarah ka enforcer is monster mein hein?
idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough.	shayed yeh sunishchit karane key liye kii way kaafee daraavane hain.	kuch scary tarah ho sakthe hein
Nope! I thought the same. I think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph.	naheen! merrie ack jaisi hii soch haye. mujhe lagata haye kii aisaa isaliye thaa kyonki antim paragraph mein koee ling sandarbh naheen thaa.	nahi! muje bhi aise laga. kyon ki inme gender context tho nahihein,
yeah probably.	haan shayed.	haan
Well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids.	vaise yeh bachchon key liye ack surakshit film lagati haye.	kids keliye tho yeh safe movie sound kartha
No, I don't think it's to make sure they're scary enough... the CDA has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university.	naheen, mujhe naheen lagata kii yeh sunishchit karane key liye haye kii way kaafee daraavane hain... cda koo kissy prakaar kaa puliskarmi banana hoga kyonki way vishvavidyalaya seey unake nishkasana key kaaran unhein parisar seey baahar nikaal rahey hain.	nahi, muje nahi lagtha ki yeh itna bhi scary hein.... voh  CDA tho campus se nikhalne vaale the kyon ki university ka expulsion ho raha tha
Although i  expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there.	haalaanki mujhe ummeed haye kii kuchh chhipe hue vayask chutkule college aur biradari kaa kaaran banate hain aur mujhe lagata haye kii way vahaan ack yaa dou koo khiska dete hain.	although, mein tho expect kar rahi thi ki koi hidden adult jokes jo college mein hota tha aur fraternity tho muje yek ya do slip karne ke liye think karaya
Ah i see that would make sense.	aaha, main dekh rhaa huun kii iska koee matlab hoga.	ah, ab kuch sense huva
I agree. I was skeptical about the cheating portion of the movie as that doesn't coincide  with a kids film and what you'd want to teach the kids at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monster's actions,.	main sahmat huun. mujhe film key dhokhadhadi vaale hisse parr sandeh thaa kyonki yeh bachchon kii film seey mell naheen khaata haye aur aap iss umr key star parr bachchon koo kyaa sikhana chaahte hain, lekin way rakshas key kaaryon key liye nakaratmak pushtakaarak laate hain.	mein maantha... mein tho is movie ka cheating portion ko skeptical laga. lekin kids film ke liye tho coincide nahi hein aur is age mein aap kya kids ko teach karenge, lekin is monster action tho thoda negative reinforcers hein
True. Movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them.	satya. aajkal filmein farmulabaddh pachadon mein iss kadar funce gaee hain kii bachche unhein pasand karane lagate hain.	sach. aaj kal ka movies tho formulaic tropes aur kids ke pickup se he banate
I hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable.	mujhe ummeed haye kii film taazaa aur thodi apratyaashit rahegi.	i hope ki movie fresh se stays karthe aur thoda unpredictable bhi hein
Keep the kids on their toes.	bachchon koo sachet rakhein.	kids ko apne toes ke saath hi rakhna chahiye
One can only hope.	koee kewal aasha hii curr sakata haye.	yek tho jarur hope rahega
And still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy it.	aur phir bhee itane samajhadaar banein kii maataa-pitaa koo iska anand lene dein.	aur still parents tho smart enough hein enjoy karne se
A 79% on a kids movie doesn't seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes.	mukhya drishyon koo padhane key baad merrie raay mein bachchon kii film parr 79% kaa pratishat bahut buraa naheen lagata.	mera opinion se 79% kids movie tho itna bad nahi rahatha, us key scenes ke read karne ke baath
Thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good. And still seem better than movies today.	isiliye merrie raay mein pichhali pixer filmein itani achchi theen. aur aaj bhee filmon seey behtar lagate hain.	isliye past pixar film mera opinion se ache hein.. still aajkal ka movies se better hein
Thats true. I think overall it sounds like a good movie.	yeh sach haye. mujhe lagata haye kii kull milakar yeh ack achchi film lagati haye.	voh tho hein.. overall muje ache movie sound kartha
Hey, what did you  think of the movie?	arey, aapane film key baare mein kyaa socha?	hey, tum movie ke baare me kya sochte ho?
I like that it is a true story.	mujhe yeh pasand haye kii yeh ack sachchi kahani haye.	mujhe ye pasand hai ki ye ek true story hai.
Yeah, very cool. I loved it but I like con-man films in general. Leonardo DiCaprio was great.	haan, bahut badhiya. mujhe yeh pasand haye lekin mujhe aam taur parr conn-maine filmein pasand hain. leonardo dicaprio mahaan they.	yeh, very cool. mujhe ye pasand hai par mujhe in general con-man pasand hai.

But I think Tom Hanks made the movie super good.	haan, mujhe lagaa kii dicaprio mahaan they. lekin mujhe lagata haye kii tomm hanks ney film bahut achchi banaai haye.	yeah mujhe lagta hai ki Dicaprio mahan the. But mujhe lagta hai ki Tom Hanks ne movie ko super good bana diya.
Yeah. And your true story point is good. I wonder what the real Frank Abagnale is like.	haan. aur aapaki sachchi kahani achchi haye. mujhe ashcharya haye kii asli frank abganel kaisa haye.	Yeah. aur aapka true story wala point accha tha. Mujhe aashcharya ki real Frank Abagnale kaise the
Supposibly just like the character played by Dicaprrio.	kathit taur parr dicaprio dwara nibhaae gaye kirdar kii tarah.	Supposibly jaisa ki character Dicaprrio dwara play kiya gaya.
He must be funny. Movie was a crack-up. Very easy to watch.	vaha majakia honah chaahiye. movie jabardast thee. dekhana bahut aasaan haye.	We funny  hona chahiye. Movie crack-up the. Watch karne me bahut easy.
I wonder if someone could still get away with something like that today.	mujhe ashcharya haye kii kyaa aaj bhee koee aisaa kuchh karke butch sakata haye.	muje abhi bhi yakin nahi hota ki koi aise kaise jaa sakthe hein
Probably could become POTUS these days.	shayed inn dinon potus bunn sakata haye.	probably voh POTUs ban jaathe hein
I wonder If the real guy is still alive.	mujhe ashcharya haye kii kyaa asli aadami abhee bhee jeevit haye.	muje tho abhi bhi yehsas nahi hota ki voh ab bhi alive hein
Good chance he is. Movie wasn't set too long ago.	achchha mauka haye vaha. movie bahut pahale sett naheen kii gaee thee.	acha chance usko mila.. movie tho itna bhi lambha nahi tha
To think the guy was only 19 years old when he started.	sochiye, usa ladke ney jaba shuruat kii thee taba vaha kewal 19 saal kaa thaa.	jab vo 19 saal ka tha tab shuru huva
Yeah. Scorcese is a great director. I like it when great ones take on lighter, funnier plots. No reason to be serious all the time.	haan. scorsese ack mahaan nirdeshak hain. mujhe yeh pasand haye jaba mahaan loga halke, majedar kathaanak apanaate hain. harr vakt gambhir baney rahane kaa koee kaaran naheen.	haan.. scorcese tho badiya director hein.. muje is tarah ka director bahut pasand hein.. yeh thoda lighter aur funnier plots dethe.. kabhi serious nahi hote.

He was also young when he went to prison.	jaba vaha jail gaye tou vaha bhee yuva they.	voh tho young hein lekin voh prison mein hein
It is really great that the FBI hired him as a investigator years later.	yeh vaastav mein bahut achchha haye kii fbi ney varshon baad usey ack anveshak key roop mein niyukt kiya.	acha huva ki FBI ne usse hired kiya aur usse investigator banaya
The twist of ending up working for the FBI is great. Reminds me of JFK's dad. He made a fortune insider trading (it was not illegal at the time) and then FDR made him the first commisioner of the SEC, where he was great at busting insider traders.	fbi key liye kaam karna samaapt karane kaa modd bahut achchha haye. mujhe jfk key pitaa kii yaad aatee haye. unhone fortune insider trading banaai (yeh usa samay avaidh naheen thaa) aur phir fdr ney unhein sec kaa pahala commissioner banaaya, jahaan vaha andaruni vyapariyon kaa bhandaphod karane mein mahaan they.	Movie me end me uska FBI k liye kaam karne wala twist badhiya hai. Mujhe JFK ke dad ki yaad dilata hai. Usne insider trading karke bahut paisa kamaya (tab wo illegal nahi tha) aur phir FDR ne us SEC ka pahla commisioner bana diya, jaha wo insider traders pakadne me maahir tha

People say the real guy made a lot of money inventing new ways of stopping cons.	loga kahate hain kii asli aadami ney vipaksh koo rokane key nae tareeke izad karke bahut paisa kamaaya.	Log kehte hai asli aadmi ne cons ko rokne k naye tareeko se bahut paisa kamaya
Makes sense.	samajh mein aataa haye.	Makes sense

It does sound pretty interesting and I can see the reviews are pretty high	yeh kaafee dilchasp lagata haye aur main dekh sakata huun kii isaki sameekshaaen bhee kaafee adhik hain	ye tho pretty interest lag raha hi aour mene dekha hi ki riviews tho pretty jyada hi.
I personally have watched this movie. I thought it was super cute and it can be related to general life.	maine vyaktigat roop seey yeh film dekhi haye. mujhe lagaa kii yeh bahut pyaara haye aur iska samanya jeevan seey sambandh hoe sakata haye.	mene khood dekha ye movie. me ne socha hi ki , ye tho bahut cute aour ye tho relate to general life.
are you familiar with any of the actors?	kyaa aap kissy abhineta seey parichit hain?	aap pi chanta hi kya koyi actors ko?
Yes the short reviews at the bottom suggest it is thought provoking.	haan, neeche dee gaee sankshipt sameekshaaen sujhaav detee hain kii yeh vichaarottejak haye.	ha, ye neeche chota reviews hi na , vo tho thoda sochne ka hi.
I can't say for sure but gennifer Goodwin sounds familiar	main nishchit roop seey naheen kaha sakata lekin ginifer goodwin parichit lagati haye	me ne nahi bhol sakta hi surely, but gennifer goodwin tho bahut familiar hi.
Have you seen any other movies from the director?	kyaa aapane nirdeshak kii koee anya filmein dekhi hain?	aap koyi movies dekha hi kya ye director ka?
Honestly, when I watch movies, I hardly ever pay attention to who made it.	imandari seey kahoon tou, jaba main filmein dekhta huun, tou main shayed hii kabhi iss baat parr dhyaan detaa huun kii ise kisane banaaya haye.	saccha yi se , jab mi ne dekte hu movies ko, mi ne utna attention nahi rakta hu, ye koun banaya hi.

Yea, Judy Hopps is the main character and is considered the first ever bunny cop.

Agreed. There's a comment at the bottom about species stereotypes which sounds interesting too	maan gayaa. neeche prajaatiyon kii roodhivaadita key baare mein ack tippani haye joe dilchasp bhee lagati haye	maantha hoon. kuch species stereotype ka comment bottom mein hein bahut interesting laga
But they thought she would be able to handle being a cop  because shes a bunny.	lekin unhone socha kii vaha pulis banane mein saksham hogi kyonki vaha ack khargosh haye.	lakin sab sochthe the ki yek bunny kaise cop bana aur voh kaise handle kar paathe
Most of the cop or police are normally these big animals.	adhikansh puliskarmi yaa puliskarmi aam taur parr yeye badey janwar hotey hain.	kahi cop yar police toh badi badi animals hi role play karte.
Yep. Which to me is a bit counterintuitive because you think of rabbits being a prey species so more likely to run away from trouble.	haan. joe merey liye thodaa ulta haye kyonki aap sochate hain kii khargosh ack shikaar prajaati hain isaliye musibat seey door bhaagne kii sambhavana adhik hoti haye.	haan. muje bhi thoda counterintuitive laga kyon ki rabbit toh yek prey species hein aur voh toh trouble mein run karna hi pasand karega
Exactly.	bilkul.	bilkul
Of course the fox has to be the bad guy	nihsandeh lomdi hii buraa aadami hoga	haan aur fox toh bad guy hein

But he turns out to be a good guy.	lekin vaha ack achchha ladka nikla.	lakin voh toh good guy nikhla
I'm trying to figure out who otterton and Manchas are from the new paragraph that flashed up	main saamane aae nae paragraph seey yeh pataa lagaane kii koshish curr rhaa huun kii otterton aur mancha kaun hain	mai figure out karne ki koshish kar raha ahi ki otterton aur Manchas kya new paragraph se flash up hue hai
Oh so like another goes away from the norm type of character in the fox	oh tou jaise koee aur lomdi mein samanya prakaar key charitra seey door chalaa jaataa haye	are to ye ek aur gaya apne fox ke character se door
Key scene two shows rabbit and fox working together!	mukhya drishya dou mein khargosh aur lomdi koo ack saath kaam karate hue dikhaaya gayaa haye!	key scene me rabbit aur fox dono ko together working karte dikhaya hai
Otterton is a missing person that judy is trying to find	otterton ack laapata vyakti haye jise judie dhoondhane kii koshish curr rahee haye	otterton ek missing person hai jise judy dhundhne ki koshish kar rahi hai
Judy kind of blackmailed Nick(fox) in working with her.	judie ney nick (fox) koo usake saath kaam karane key liye blackmail kiya.	Judy ne lagbhag Nick(fox) ko blackmai kiya uske sath work karne ke liye
I see. It sounds like a movie that has a well developed story line	achchha aisaa haye. yeh ack aisee film kii tarah lagati haye jisaki kahani achchi tarah seey vikasit haye	I see, yah to us movie ki tarah sound kar raha hai jiska ek well developed story line hai
It was a very good kids movie.	yeh bachchon kii bahut achchi film thee.	yah kids ki lye badhiya movie thi
I'm just shocked that it wasn't as big as the Disney movies	main buss iss baat seey hairan huun kii yeh disney filmon jitani badee naheen thee	mujhe ye dekh ke shock laga kiy Disney movies ki tarah badi nahi hai
Oh ok. I'm a little bit wary of rotten tomato ratings also	oh thheek. main sadey hue tamatar kii rating koo laker bhee thodaa savdhan huun	Oh ok, mai bhi rotten tomato ki rating ko lekar dukhi rahta hu.
They can sometimes stray quite far from the other review sites of a bunch of very keen reviewers want to bump the score	way kabhi-kabhi anya sameeksha saiton seey kaafee door bhatak sakate hain kyonki bahut utsuk sameekshakon kaa ack samooh score badhaana chaahata haye	kabhi kabhi wo dusri review sites se jo kuch keen reveiwers ke dwara hoti hai kafi bhatak jate hai
Ok scene three has some drug manufacturing going on!	thheek haye drishya teen mein kuchh dawaa kaa nirmaan chala rhaa haye!	Ok scene three me kuch drug manufacturing ho rahi hai.
Yes, the drugs make the animals revert to their natural state.	haan, davaayen jaanvaron koo unaki praakritik avastha mein vaapas laa detee hain.	Yes, drugs animals ko wapas unki natural state me le aati hai.
Oh so there must be some other force making them break moulds	oh, tou avashya hii koee anya shakti hogi joe unhein sanchon koo todane parr majboor curr rahee haye	oh wanha par kuch dusra force bhi hona chahiye unko break moulds banane ke liye.
They become crazy animals again	way phir seey pagal janwar bunn jaate hain	Wo fir se crazy animals ban gaye.
But this is all while they still think Judy is a small cop	lekin yeh sub taba haye jaba way abhee bhee sochate hain kii judie ack chhota pulis vaalaa haye	but ye sab tab bhi hai jab unhe laga thai ki Judy small cop hai
so they still dont consider her a strong animal	isaliye way abhee bhee usey ack majboot janwar naheen maanate hain	so wo abhi bhi use strong animal nahi consider karte.
I see. Interesting. Hope she gets more respect later with all the arrests	achchha aisaa haye. dilchasp. aasha haye kii baad mein sabhi giraftaariyon key baad usey aur adhik sammaan milega	I see, Interesting. Hope baki arrests ke baad use or jyada respect mile
yea she does	haan, vaha karati haye	Yea usne kar dikhaya

how about yours?	aur tumhara kyaa haal haye?	tumhare bare me kya?
Even though he didn't have a voice I liked Sven. I love how Disney always puts in non talking characters in their films that help move the story along	haalaanki usake paas koee aavaaz naheen thee, phir bhee mujhe swen pasand aayaa. mujhe yeh pasand haye kii kaise disney hamesha apani filmon mein gair-bolane vaale paatron koo rakhta haye joe kahani koo aage badhaane mein madad karate hain	Even thoough Sven ki voice nahi thi par mujhe pasand hai. mujhe achcha lagta hai, Disney kaise bina voice ke character ko film me lekar bhi kahani move karta hai.
Yeah its impressive how they can give a character lots of personality without even having a voice.	haan, yeh prabhaavshaali haye kii kaise way binaa aavaaj key bhee kissy paatr koo bharpur vyaktitva dey sakate hain.	haan isake prabhaavashaalee ve kaise ek aavaaj ke bina bhee ek vyaktitv ke bahut saare charitr de sakate hain.

usually sequels can be disappointing but that doesn't seem to be the case with animated movies.	aamtaur parr seekwal nirashajanak hoe sakate hain lekin animated filmon key mamle mein aisaa naheen lagata haye.	aamataur par seekval niraashaajanak ho sakate hain lekin yah enimeted philmon ke maamale mein nahin lagata hai.
I think it could be really successful, especially as there has been a good break in time since the first one came out	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh vaastav mein safal hoe sakata haye, khaskar isaliye kyonki pahali release key baad seey kaafee samay beet chuka haye	mujhe lagata hai ki yah vaastav mein saphal ho sakata hai, khaasakar jab se pahalee baar baahar aane se samay mein ek achchha brek aaya hai
It is interesting that Disney was able to add onto the history of works such as Beauty and the beast	yeh dilchasp haye kii disney beauty aind dha beast jaise kaaryon koo itihas mein jodane mein saksham thaa	yah dilachasp hai ki dijnee saundary aur jaanavar jaise kaaryon ke itihaas mein jodane mein saksham tha

Mene socha mene use movie ke dauran bulaya and finance ke bare me kuch kaha kaise redheads are always portrayes as badguys

Bye!	alvida!	Aavjo
What is your opinion on the movie Jaws?	film jozz parr aapaki kyaa raay haye?	philm joz par aapakee kya raay hai?
To be honest, I find shark movies to be terrifying.	sach kahuun tou, mujhe shark filmein daravani lagati hain.	sach kahoon, to mujhe shaark philmen bhayaanak lagatee hain.
I can't say I blame you. The movie definitely makes that fear worse!	main yeh naheen kaha sakata kii main aapako doshi maanata huun. film nishchit roop seey usa darr koo aur bhee badatar banaa detee haye!	main yah nahin kah sakata ki main tumhen dosh deta hoon. philm nishchit roop se us dar ko badatar bana detee hai!
Did you know that this film was based on a book?	kyaa aap jaanate hain kii yeh film ack kitab parr adharit thee?	Kya tumhe pata hai ki ye film ek book par based hai.
No, I didn't. Not surprised though. Most movies tend to be.	naheen, maine naheen kiya. halanki ashcharya naheen huaa. adhikatar filmein hoti hain.	Nahi , maine nahi. Lekin mein surprise nahi hun zyadatar movies mein aisa hi hota hai.
I do love the Jaws music though.	haalaanki mujhe jozz sangeet pasand haye.	Lekin Jaws ka music mujhe pasand hai.
Agreed, it heightens the tension and makes it scarier, but that's kind of the point.	sahmat huun, yeh tanaav koo badhaata haye aur ise daravana banaata haye, lekin baat kuchh aisee hii haye.	Agreed, ye tension ko badhata hai aur isko aur daravana banata hai, lekin shayad uska wahi point hai.
Are you surprised at how high the rating is for the film's critic score? And if I heard the music while driving, I would think someone was coming to take me out. Haha	kyaa aap iss baat seey aashcharyachakit hain kii film key sameekshak score kii rating kitni oonchi haye? aur aggar main gaadi chalaate samay sangeet sunata, tou mujhe lagata kii koee mujhe baahar nikaalane aaa rhaa haye. haaha	Kya aap surprised hain ki is film ki critic score rating itni high hai ? Aur agar mein iska music driving karte samay sunoon to mujhe lagega ki koi mujhe maarne aa raha hai. Haha
97% is incredibly high, I would have thought that there would be at least some people throwing low scores in there somewhere.	97% avishvasaniya roop seey uchch haye, maine socha hoga kii cumm seey cumm kuchh loga vahaan cumm ank laa rahey honge.	97% bahut zyada high hai , mujhe laga ki kam se kam kuch log to low scores denge.
Do you agree that it's a "cheerfully perverse" scare movie?	kyaa aap sahmat hain kii yeh ack "hansmukh vikrit" daraane vaali film haye?	Kya aap sehmat hai ki ye "cheerfully perverse" daravani movie hai ?
That's what I thought as well. Maybe it's because it was never done before in it's time and was so different when it came out? It might be easier to "give it a pass"   And I would say it could be "cheerfully perverse" depending on the kind of movies you enjoy.	maine bhee yahee socha thaa. shayed aisaa isaliye haye kyonki yeh apane samay mein pahale kabhi naheen kiya gayaa thaa aur jaba yeh saamane aayaa tou yeh bahut alag thaa? ise "chhod denaa" aasaan hoe sakata haye aur main kahoonga kii aap jiss tarah kii filmon kaa anand lete hain, usake aadhar parr yeh "hansmukh roop seey vikrit" hoe sakata haye.	Mujhe bhi aisa hi lagta hai. Shayad isliye kyunki us zamane mein aisa pehle nahi hua tha aur jo nikal ke aaya wo kafi alag tha ? Usko ""give it a pass" dena easier hoga aur mein kahunga ki ye "cheerfully perverse" depending on aap kaisi movies pasand karte hain.
Do you think that it "is too gruesome for children"?	kyaa aapako lagata haye kii yeh "bachchon key liye bahut bhayaanak haye"?	Kya aapko lagta hai ki it "is too gruesome for children"?
For small children, yes. I could see them having nightmares.	chhote bachchon key liye, haan. main unhein burey sapane aatey hue dekh sakata thaa.	Chhote bacchon ke liye haan, unko nightmares aa sakte hain.
I definitely agree with that. I do find it odd that it is considered a "Thriller" film.	main nishchit roop seey isase sahmat huun. mujhe yeh ajib lagata haye kii ise ack "thriller" film maanaa jaataa haye.	main definitely isase agree karta hoon. Mujhe yah ajeeb lagata hai ki ise ek "Thriller" film maana jaata hai.
I think it's interesting that in the key scenes it describes the economic impact on a beach town of the shark attacks. Makes you wonder if they'd cover something like that up to make more money in real life.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh dilchasp haye kii mukhya drishyon mein yeh shark key hamalon key kaaran samudra tateey shahar parr padane vaale aarthik prabhaav kaa varnan kartaa haye. aapako ashcharya hotaa haye kii kyaa way vaastavik jeevan mein adhik paisa kamaane key liye aisaa kuchh cover karenge.	mujhe lagata hai ki yah interesting hai ki key scenes mein yah  shark attacks ke ek beach town pareconomic impact ka baare main batata hai. Aapako aashchary hota hai ki kya ve real life mein adhik paisa banaane ke lie aisa kuchh cover karenge.
In today's society, I think that would absolutely be the case. Even if there was a bounty hunter hired, they would probably go, "Nothing to see here, have fun!"	mujhe lagata haye kii aaj key samaaj mein bilkul aisaa hii hoga. yahaan taka ​​​​kii aggar koee inami shikari bhee kaam parr rakhaa gayaa thaa, tou way shayed jaayenge, "yahaan dekhane key liye kuchh bhee naheen haye, mazey karo!"	aaj ke society mein, mujhe lagata hai ki aisa hee hoga. yahaan tak ​​ki agar ek bounty hunter ko kaam par rakha gaya tha, to ve shaayad bolengain, "yahaan dekhane ke lie kuchh bhee nahin hai, maze karo!"
I find it interesting that they put it in a fictional "New England resort town". You would think they would've picked somewhere in California since there's so many beaches and how huge it is.	mujhe yeh dilchasp lagata haye kii unhone ise ack kaalpanik "nyu ingland resort town" mein rakhaa haye. aap sochenge kii unhone california mein hii kaheen chunaa hoga kyonki vahaan bahut saare samudra tata hain aur yeh kitna vishal haye.	mujhe yah interesting lagata hai ki unhonne ise fictional  "New England resort town" mein rakha tha. Aapako lagata hai ki ve Californiamein kaheen aur le gae hote kyonki vahaan bahut saare beaches hain aur yah kitana vishaal hai.
Agreed, there typically aren't many shark attacks in New England, usually further south or on the west coast.	sahmat huun, aamtaur parr nyu ingland mein, aamtaur parr aage dakshin mein yaa paschimi tata parr, adhik shark hamale naheen hotey hain.	Main ye maanta hoon ki , aamataur par  New England mein bahut saare shark attacks nahin hote hain, aamataur par south mein ya west coast par.
I can't imagine I would keep going to the beach as a tourist if lots of people kept turning up dead.	main kalpana naheen curr sakata kii aggar bahut saare loga mrit milate rahey tou main ack paryatak key roop mein samudra tata parr jaataa rahoonga.	main imagine nahin kar sakata ki main ek tourist ke roop mein  beacht par jata rahoongan , agar bahut saare log marate hue paaye jate rahein.
I agree. The movie is kind of silly the more you think about it. Especially when people keep believing the town and beach team that everything is fine. Yet people keep dying? I guess they want you to suspend disbelief. Haha.	main sahmat huun. jitna adhik aap isake baare mein sochenge yeh film utani hii murkhtapurna haye. khastaur parr taba jaba loga shahar aur samudratat team parr vishvaas karate rahein kii sub kuchh thheek haye. phir bhee loga marate rahate hain? mujhe lagata haye kii way chaahte hain kii aap avishvaas koo sthagit curr dein. haaha.	Main agree karta hoon. Movie ek tarah se silly hai , jitana bhi aap isake baare mein sochate hain. khaasakar jab log shahar aur beach team par vishvaas karate rahate ki sab kuchh theek hai.phir bhee log marate rahate hain? mujhe lagata hai ki ve chaahate hain ki aap disbelief ko suspend karen. hah।
Or you would think that tourists would join in on the bounty to make the money.	yaa aap sochenge kii paryatak paisa kamaane key liye inam mein shamil honge.	ya aapako lagata hai ki tourists paisa banaane ke lie bounty mein shaamil honge.
I wasn't aware that there were so many different types of sharks so near to the shore.	mujhe iss baat kii jaankaari naheen thee kii tata key itane karib itani saaree vibhinn prakaar kii shark theen.	mujhe pata nahin tha ki kinaare ke paas itane saare different type ke sharks the.
The key scens describes both a tiger shark and a great white.	mukhya drishya mein tiger shark aur grate white donon kaa varnan haye.	key scenes main tiger shark aur ek great white, donon ka varnan kiya gaya hai.
I wonder if the mayor is paid off somewhere in the town or gets a cut of the beaches being open? He's far to adamant about keeping them open.   And I always thought Tiger Sharks were smaller.	mujhe ashcharya haye kii kyaa meyer koo shahar mein kaheen bhugtan kiya jaataa haye yaa khule samudra taton kaa hissa milata haye? vaha unhein khula rakhane parr adey hue hain.   aur maine hamesha socha thaa kii tiger shark chhoti hoti hain.	Main soch raha tha ki mayor sheher mein kahin paise leta hai ya beach ke khulne pe? Woh beach kholne par bohot adamant tha. Aur mujhe humesha lagta tha ki Tiger Sharks chotti hoti hain.
I always think of Great White's as the huge "Jaws" sharks.	main hamesha grate white koo vishal "jozz" shark key roop mein sochata huun.	Maine Great Whites ko humesha unn badi "Jaws" sharks ki tarah socha hai.
It seems odd that they don't ask a scientist or marine biologist at some point to intervene.	yeh ajib lagata haye kii way kissy bindu parr kissy vaigyaanik yaa samudri jeevavigyaani seey hastakshep karane key liye naheen kahate hain.	Ajeeb hai ki woh kissi scientist ya marine biologist ko beech mein nahi laa rahe.
Even the last key scene describes a pretty limited plan to hook the shark or harpoon it.	yahaan taka ​​kii antim mukhya drishya mein shark koo fansaane yaa usey bhaala maarne kii ack bahut hii seemit yojana kaa varnan kiya gayaa haye.	Last scene mein bhi bohot hi limited plan hai shark ko hook ya harpoon karne ka.
I agree. They have an "Oceanographer" to help determine a shark attack. But no scientists ever get brought in to help the situation.	main sahmat huun. shark key hamale kaa nirdhaaran karane mein madad key liye unake paas ack "samudra vigyaani" haye. lekin sthiti mein madad key liye kabhi koee vaigyaanik naheen laaya jaataa.	Sahi, I agree. Unke paas shark attack determine karne ke liye ek "Oceanographer" hai. Par koi scientists nahi laaye help karne ke liye.
It seems like a pretty poor plan, and they end up having to make it up as they go along.	aisaa lagata haye kii yeh ack bahut hii kharaab yojana haye, aur jaise-jaise way aage badhate hain, unhein ise puuraa karna padata haye.	Kaafi bekar plan hai, aur aage jaate jaate woh plan banaate jaa rahe hain.
It seems crazy that a shark could take out a "Shark-proof" cage.	yeh pagalpan lagata haye kii ack shark "shark-proof" pinjare koo baahar nikaal sakati haye.	Kitna crazy hai ki shark ne "shark-proof" cage todd diya.
Plus, the reward of only $10,000 seems pretty low to risk lives.	saath hii, zaan jokhim mein daalane key liye kewal $10,000 kaa inam kaafee cumm lagata haye.	Aur, $10,000 ka reward bohot kam hai life risk karne ke liye.
Maybe it was worth a lot more in 1975?	shayed 1975 mein isaki keemat bahut adhik thee?	Shayad 1975 mein isse zyaada worth tha.
I agree. Not worth it to me. I'll go on vacation in NYC instead and avoid the shark. Haha.	main sahmat huun. merey liye yeh isake laayak naheen haye. isake bajaay main nyc mein chhuttiyon parr jaaoonga aur shark seey bachoonga. haaha.	Haan. Mere liye toh worth nahi hai. Shark ko chhod ke, main NYC vacation par chala jaoonga. Haha.
And it was definitely worth more in 1975. I just don't know how much.	aur 1975 mein iska mulya nishchit roop seey adhik thaa. main naheen jaanata kii kitna.	Aur yeh 1975 Definitely adhik kimat ka hoga.me nahi janti how much.
What did you think of Gal Gadots portrayal of Wonder Woman?	aapane galle gadot key wonder women key chitran key baare mein kyaa socha?	wonder woman mei gal gadots portrayal ke bare mei kya khayal hai?

Yes he is! I'm guessing you've seen Monsters University?	haan vaha haye! main anuman lagaa rhaa huun kii aapane monsters university dekhi haye?	haa vo hai! Mene shoch ki tumne Monsters University dekha hai?
I did when it came out years ago, just never thought to look at the voice acting.	jaba yeh varshon pahale aayaa thaa tou maine aisaa kiya thaa, lekin aavaaj abhinay koo dekhane key baare mein kabhi naheen socha thaa.	mene kiya jab ye kuch saal pahale aa gai thi, mene nahi socha tha ki voice acting hogi.
When did you see it?	tumane ise kaba dekhaa?	tumne kab dekha?
Hello, how are	kaisen haye aap	Hello, kaise he
you doing?	aap curr rahey hain?	aap kar rahe hai?
Hi!  I'm doing well, thanks!	namaste!  main achchha huun shukriya!	hi! main accha kar raha hun, thanks!
So, what did you think of the blind side?	tou, aapane andhe paksh key baare mein kyaa socha?	so, aapne blind side ke baare me kya socha?
I love sports documentaries, so I favored this movie. H ow about you?	mujhe khel vrittachitra pasand hain, isaliye mujhe yeh film pasand aaee. aap kaise hain?	mujhe sports documentaries pasand hai, So main in movies ka favor karta hun, Aapka baare me kya hai?
It was quite good.  I'm not surprised it got such good reviews on Cinemascore	yeh kaafee achchha thaa.  mujhe ashcharya naheen haye kii ise cinemascore parr itani achchi sameekshaaen mileen	Ye quite good tha. Main surprised nahi hun ki ise cinemascore me itne acche reviews mile
Same here. It is a little odd that it got lower reviews on other platforms like Metacritic. I take it you like sports docs too?	yahaan bhee aisaa hii. yeh thodaa ajib haye kii metacritic jaise anya platform parr ise cumm sameekshaaen mileen. main maanata huun kii aapako khel dastaavez bhee pasand hain?	Same here. Ye little odd hai ki ise dusre platforms par lower reviews mile jaise ki Metacritic. Main apko sports docs ki tarah leta hun?
Yes, very much.  It's surprising how much adversity Oher had to overcome, don't you think?	haan, bahut jyada.  yeh ashcharya kii baat haye kii ohar koo kitni pratikool paristhitiyon seey ubarna padaa, kyaa aapako naheen lagata?	Yes, bahut had tak. Main surprise hun ki kitne adversity Oher ko kam karni padegi, aapko nahi lagta?
Yeah, It must've been really difficult on him. I wonder how he felt having to relive his experience through the movie. I don't know how I would handle it.	haan, yeh usake liye sachmuch kathin rhaa hoga. mujhe ashcharya haye kii film key madhyam seey apane anubhav koo dobara dohrakar unhein kaisa mahsoos huaa. mujhe naheen pataa kii main ise kaise sambhalunga.	Yeah, ye nischit hi unhe liye kafi difficult hoga. I wonder kaise unhone is movie ke dwara apne experience ko relive karna mahsoos kiya hoga. Main nahi jaanta ki main ise kaise handle karuga.
Did you like Sandra Bullock in the movie?	kyaa aapako film mein sandra bullock pasand aaee?	kya tumhe Sandra Bullock is movie me pasand aayi?
Yeah, Bullock was great.  Although, she's a great actor so I think she does well in most of her roles	haan, bullock mahaan thaa.  haalaanki, vaha ack behtareen adakara hain isaliye mujhe lagata haye kii vaha apani adhikansh bhoomikaon mein achchha abhinay karati hain	Hann, Bullock great thi.  Waise bhi, woh great actor hai and zyadatar roles mein achcha hi karti hai.
Totally agree. Easy to see why the critics applauded her performance	purnataya sahmat. yeh dekhana aasaan haye kii alochakon ney unake pradarshan kii sarahana kyon kii	Main totally manta hoon.  Easily dikhta hai critics kyon use performance ko applaud karte hain.
Any thoughts on any of the other actors? I had forgotten Tim McGraw was in the movie, haha	kissy anya abhineta key baare mein koee vichaar? main bhool gayaa thaa kii tima mcgra film mein they, haaha	Doosre actors ke baare mein kya thoughts hain?  Main bhook gaya tha ki Tim McGraw bhi movie mein tha, haha.
I thought Quinton Aaron was very good, too.	maine socha kii quinton aaron bhee bahut achche they.	Mujhe laga Quinton Aaron bhi bahut achcha tha.
It must have been tough to go through foster care so much, but I think it's good that Oher found something to latch on to in football.	paalan-poshan dekhbhal seey gujarna kathin rhaa hoga, lekin mujhe lagata haye kii yeh achchha haye kii ohar koo football mein aage badhane key liye kuchh milaa.	Foster care se guzarna bahut mushkil hua hoga, par achchi baat hai football mein Oher ko naya sahara mila.
Yeah, he certainly excelled in it. I think he was able to apply his protective qualities in his personality to football	haan, usane nishchit roop seey isamen utkrishtata hassil kii. mujhe lagata haye kii vaha apane vyaktitva key surakshaatmak gunon koo football mein lagu karane mein saksham they	Haan, usne bahut hi achcha pradarshan kiya.  Mujhe lagta hai usne apne personality ke protective qualities to football mein dikhaya.
Definitely.  He was also very lucky to finally find a good foster family.  It's super difficult to find a good family that cares about their foster kids.	nishchit roop seey.  vaha bhee bahut bhagyashali thaa kii aakhirkaar usey ack achchha paalak parivaar mill gayaa.  aisaa achchha parivaar dhoondhana bahut mushkil haye joe apane paalak bachchon kii parwah kartaa hoe.	Bilkul.  Woh bahut lucky tha ki use achcha foster family mil gayi.  Ek achche family ka milna bahut mushkil hai jo apne foster kids ka care karti hai.
Yeah, I would imagine that it's hard. I feel like that's why it was such agood movie. Nothing seemed to be all that good in his life until he found a family that would treat him like one of their own	haan, mujhe lagata haye kii yeh kathin haye. mujhe aisaa lagata haye kii isiliye yeh itani achchi film thee. usake jeevan mein kuchh bhee itna achchha naheen lugg rhaa thaa jaba taka kii usey ack aisaa parivaar naa mill jaae joe usake saath apane jaisa vyavhaar karey	Haan, yeh kitna hard hai, main samaj sakta hoon.  Mujhe lagta hai yeh movie isi liye itna achcha laga.  Uski zindagi mein kuch bhi achcha nahin tha jab tak us family ko usne dekha jo use apna samajte the,
What do you think of the idea of "protective instincts" and how it influenced Oher's behavior?	aap "surakshaatmak pravritti" key vichaar key baare mein kyaa sochate hain aur isane ohar key vyavhaar koo kaise prabhaavit kiya?	Tumhe  "protective instincts" idea kaise lagta hai aur is idea ne Oher ke behavior ko kaise influence kiya?
I remember he ranked very high when he was taking his career test. It definitely translated well into his efforts in football. Do you think that helped his family as well?	mujhe yaad haye kii jaba vaha apane currier kii pareeksha dey rhaa thaa tou usaki rank bahut oonchi thee. isane nishchit roop seey football mein unake prayason koo achchi tarah seey prabhaavit kiya. kyaa aapako lagata haye kii isase unake parivaar koo bhee madad millie?	Mujhe yaad hai uska rank bahut achcha tha jab woh career test le raha tha.  Yeh rank use football mein achche efforts dalne me kaam aya.  Kya tumhe lagta hai ki is se uski family ko bhi help mili?
I'm sure it did.  It's ironic, though, that he has such strong protective instincts when he was abandoned by his mother. Do you think he was overcompensating?	mujhe yakeen haye aisaa huaa.  haalaanki, yeh vidambana haye kii jaba usaki maan ney usey chhod diyaa thaa, taba usake paas itani majboot surakshaatmak pravritti thee. kyaa aapako lagata haye kii vaha zaroorat seey zyaadaa muaavazaa dey rhaa thaa?	Main sure hoon aisa hi hua.  Magar, usme itna stron protective instincts hain jabki usi maa ne use abandon kar diya tha.  Kya tumhe lagta hai ki woh overcompensate kar raha tha?
How did you feel about the scene where Collins adopts Oher?	aapako vaha drishya kaisa lagaa jahaan collins ohar koo god letaa haye?	Tumhe woh scene kaise laga jahan Collins Oher ko adopt karta hai?
As for being overcompensating, that he was not. I think that was built naturally in him, where he was not consciously  trying to do it.	jahaan taka ​​jarurat seey jyada muaavaja dene kii baat haye tou vaha aisaa naheen thaa. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh usamen swaabhaavik roop seey nirmit huaa thaa, jahaan vaha sachet roop seey aisaa karane kii koshish naheen curr rhaa thaa.	Mujhe nahin lagta ki woh overcompensate kar raha tha.  Mujhe lagta hai yeh usme naturally built hai aur woh consciously karne ki koshish nahin kar raha tha.
How did you feel about the scene where Collins adopts Oher?	aapako vaha drishya kaisa lagaa jahaan collins ohar koo god letaa haye?	Tumhe woh scene kaise laga jahan Collins Oher ko adopt karta hai?
I think LeighAnne's friends were concerned that Collins would not be safe around him.	mujhe lagata haye kii leey ainee key dost chintit they kii collin usake aspas surakshit naheen rahega.	Mujhe lagta hai  LeighAnne ke friends concerned the ki Collins uske paas safe nahin rah paayega.
I think that was probably a tough choice for the family to make as a whole.	mujhe lagata haye kii sambhavatah poore parivaar key liye yeh ack kathin vikalp thaa.	Mujhe lagta hai as a whole, woh shayad family ke liye ek tough choice tha.
Do you think going to Ole Miss was a good decision?	kyaa aapako lagata haye ole miss key paas jaanaa ack achchha nirnay thaa?	Kya tumhe lagta hai ki Ole Miss jaana ek achcha decision tha?
Yeah in the long run, he felt like he had family there. Do you think that he meant his mother at all in that choice?	haan, lambe samay mein, usey aisaa mahsoos huaa jaise uska vahaan parivaar haye. kyaa aapako lagata haye kii usa chunaav mein uska matlab apani maan seey thaa?	Haan, anth mein, use laga ki uski family wahan thi. Kya tumhe lagta hai ki uski choice mein uski mother bhi shaamil thi?
Probably not because she was a drug addict.  I think he was referring to his adopted family.	shayed isaliye naheen kyonki vaha nashe kii aadee thee.  mujhe lagata haye kii vaha apane dattak parivaar kaa jikr curr rahey they.	Nahin ho sakta kyonki woh ek drug addict thi. Mujhe lagta hai woh apni adopted family ke baare mein bata raha tha.
How do you think the gang leader in his old town affected him?	aapako kyaa lagata haye kii usake puraane shahar mein giroh key netaa ney usa parr kyaa prabhaav daala?	Tumhe kya lagta hai ki uske old town ke gang leader ka uspar kya asar hua?
I think that was what grew his protective instincts even more. He was worried what might happen to his adoptive family when Leigh Anne and Collins were threatened by the gang leader.	mujhe lagata haye kii isase unaki surakshaatmak pravritti aur bhee adhik badh gaee. vaha chintit thaa kii jaba leh ainee aur collins koo giroh key netaa ney dhamki dee tou usake dattak parivaar key saath kyaa hoe sakata haye.	mujhe lagta hai usse hi uske protective instinct aur grow kar gaye. Jab gang leader ne Leigh Anne aur Collins ko dhamkaya to wo chinta me tha k uske adoptive family ko kya hoga
Do you think he made the right decision to fight back?	kyaa aapako lagata haye kii usane jawabi ladaai kaa faisala sahee liya?	Kya tumhe lagta hai uska fight back karne ka decision sahi tha?
Yeah, definitely, you have to protect yourself!	haan, nishchit roop seey, aapako apani suraksha swayam karni hogi!	Haan, definitely, tumhe khud ko to bachana hi hoga
Absolutely, I think he felt more of a connection with his adoptive family than with his own!	bilkul, mujhe lagata haye kii usey apane parivaar kii tulana mein apane dattak parivaar key saath adhik judaav mahsoos huaa!	Absolutely, mujhe lagta hai uska apni khudki family se jyada adoptive family se connection hai.
Definitely, and who wouldn't.  I don't understand why people are so connected to their blood relatives if they weren't around to be part of their family	nishchit roop seey, aur kaun naheen karega.  mujhe yeh samajh mein naheen aataa kii loga apane rakt sambandhiyon seey itane judey hue kyon hain yadi way unake parivaar kaa hissa naheen they	Definitely, kiska nahi hoga. Mujhe ye nahi samjh me aata log apne blood relative se itna connected kyu rahte hai bhale he wo family ka part banne k liye paas me nahi the
Yep. It seems like the Tuohy family accepted him and made him feel like he belonged there with him.	haan. aisaa lagata haye jaise tuhi parivaar ney usey sweekar curr liya aur usey aisaa mahsoos karaaya jaise vaha usake saath haye.	Haan, aisa lagta hai ki Tuohy family ne use accept kiya aur aisa feel karwa k jaise wo unke saaath hi belong karta hai
Good conversation, thanks for chatting!	achchi baatchit, baatchit key liye dhanyavaad!	Accha conversation, chat karne k liye thanks

Does John get any help getting his revenge?	kyaa johnn koo apana badala lene mein koee madad milati haye?	kya john ko koi madad kiya ki revenge se bachane ke liye?
John visited Aurello who tells him Losef  is the son of  Viggo.	johnn ney aurelo kaa daura kiya jisane usey bataaya kii lossef vigago kaa betaa haye.	john, aurello se mila aur losef ke baare mein bathaya

John learns that Losef is at the Night club from Winston of the Continental, he prepares to get Losef. He is the son of Viggo who is the head of the Russian syndicate in New York.	johnn koo pataa chalata haye kii lossef continental key winston seey night club mein haye, vaha lossef koo paane kii taiyari kartaa haye. vaha vigo kaa betaa haye joe newyork mein russie syndicate kaa pramukh haye.	john sikha ki losef yek night club mein hein aur voh use pakadna chatha hein. voh viggo ka betha hein jo russian syndicate newyork mein hein uska head hein

Hello. I like it. It's very interesting and hilarious to me seeing Joe Pesci in a movie like this since I know him form the more serious movies he did.	namaste. mujhe yeh pasand haye. joe pesky koo iss tarah kii film mein dekhana merey liye bahut dilchasp aur prafullit karane vaalaa haye kyonki main jaanata huun kii unhone adhik gambhir filmein banaai hain.	Hello. Mujhe acchi lagi. Mujhe Joe Pesci ko aisi interesting aur hilarious movie me dekh ke accha laga kyuki maine unhe jyadatar serious movies me hi dekha hai.
Very true! He nailed the role of Harry! All of the actors did! Was he your favorite actor in the film?	bilkul sach! unhone hairi kii bhoomika koo bakhubi nibhaaya! sabhi kalakaron ney kiya! kyaa vaha film mein aapka pasandida abhineta thaa?	Sahi kha! Usne Harry ka role bohot accha nibhaya. Sabhi actors ne accha kam kiya! Kya wah apke favorite the film me?
Macaulay Culkin is my favorite in the movie. It was so fun just watching him outsmart 2 grown men.	film mein maikaale kalkin merrie pasandida hain. usey dou vayask purushon koo maat dete hue dekhana bahut majedar thaa.	Is movie me Macaulay Culkin mere favorite the. Unko 2 adults ko outsmart karte dekh bahut maza aaya.
Agreed! He was my favorite as well! I can't help but agree with CinemaScore's rating of A as that would be the rating I'd give the film as well!	maan gayaa! vaha meraa bhee pasandida thaa! main cinemascore kii aii rating seey sahmat hue binaa naheen reh sakata kyonki yahee rating hogi joe main film koo bhee doonga!	Agreed! Vah mere bhi favorite the! CinemaScore ke rating A se main bilkul agree karta hu, mai bhi is film ko yahi ratings dunga.
Yes this is a christmas classic and deserves an A rating. I feel the critic that described the movie as having an implausible plot is taking the movie more seriously than the creators of the movie intended it to be.	haan, yeh ack chrismus classic haye aur aii rating kaa hakdar haye. mujhe lagata haye kii jiss aalochak ney film koo ack avishvasaniya kathaanak key roop mein varnit kiya haye, vaha film koo film key rachnakaron kii apeksha seey adhik gambhirta seey leey rhaa haye.	Yes, yah ek christmas classic hai aur A rating ke layak hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki jo critics is movie ko iske implausible plot ke liye criticize karte hai woh is movie ko kuchh jyada hi seriously le rahe hai, creators ka irada serious movie banane ka nahi tha.
Very well said! Some of the critics were out of their minds. Especially the one you described as well as the one who called the first half "flat and unsurprising".	bahut achchi tarah seey kahaa! kuchh aalochak aape seey baahar they. visheshkar uska, jiska aapane varnan kiya aur saath hii uska, jisane pahale bhaag koo "sapaat aur aashcharyajanak" kahaa.	Sahi kaha! Kuchh critics pagal ho gaye hain. Khash kar woh jiska apne description diya aur woh jisne first half ko "flat aur unsurprising" bataya.
Yes I found the first half very entertaining. I haven't seen this movie in a little wow I might go back and watch it	haan, mujhe pahala bhaag bahut manoranjak lagaa. maine yeh film thodi see bhee naheen dekhi haye, shayed main vaapas jaakar ise dekh sakata huun	Han, muje first half bada entertaining laga. Maine ye movie little wow me nahi dekhi, main shayad jaunga aur dekhunga.
I feel you! So hard to believe it was released in 1990!	main tumhen mahsoos kartaa huun! yeh vishvaas karna bahut kathin haye kii yeh 1990 mein release hui thee!	Main apko feel kar sakta hu. Yakin nahin hota ki yeh movie 1990 me release huyi thi.
I like the quote "sadistic festival of adult-bashing". Between's Kevin's parents forgetting him and the burglars this movie doesn't make adult looks too bright.	mujhe yeh uddharan pasand haye "vayaskon koo kosane kaa parpeedak tyohar". cavin key maataa-pitaa dwara usey aur choron koo bhool jaane key beach yeh film vayask chhavi koo adhik ujjwal naheen banaati haye.	Mujhe  "sadistic festival of adult-bashing" yah quote achha lagta hai. Kevin ke parents ka use bhulna aur burglars ke bich yah movie adults ko bahut accha nahi deikhati.
That is true! Ha! Pesci and Stern did a great job acting the part as adults who weren't very bright! John Hughes wrote the movie perfectly!	yeh sach haye! haa! pesky aur stern ney una vayaskon kii bhoomika nibhaate hue bahut achchha kaam kiya joe bahut pratibhashali naheen they! johnn huges ney film koo behtareen tareeke seey likhaa!	yeh tho sach hein! ha! Pesci aur Stern tho acting ka badiya job kiya voh tho adults ka part bhi kiya jo itna bhi bright nahi tha! john Hughes ne is movie ko perfectly write kiya hein
I related to the character Kevin being made fun of  by his family since kids deal with that all the time. The part of the movie always always hits a soft spot for me.	main cavin key charitra kaa usake parivaar dwara mazaak udaaye jaane seey judaa huun kyonki bachche harr samay isase joojhate hain. film kaa hissa hamesha merey liye ack naram sthaan parr hotaa haye.	mein tho us kevin character ko relate kar raha hun voh tho fun hein uska family aur kids tho ache tarah deal kar raha tha. is part ka movie tho hamesha soft spot mein hi hit hota.
Same here! I honestly felt bad for Kevin at first seeing as how he was ridiculed by his siblings/cousins before being left behind. Like you, i could relate as well to the ridicule aspect of it.	yahaan bhee aisaa hii! imandari seey kahoon tou sabse pahale mujhe cavin key liye yeh dekhkar buraa lagaa kii peechhe chhoot jaane seey pahale usake bhaai-bahanon/chachere bhaaiyon ney uska kiss tarah upahaas kiya thaa. aapaki tarah, main bhee isake upahaaspurna pahalu seey juda sakata huun.	yaha bhi! muje honestly kevin ke liye bura laga kyon ki pehele baar use dekha tho ridiculed mein uska siblings yaani cousins tho uska picha chod diya. aapke tarah, tho mein us ridicule ka aspect se relate kar raha tha
I wonder what kind of job Kevin's dad worked that he could afford to fly that many people to Paris for christmas. I blame him for all of this!	mujhe ashcharya haye kii cavin key pitaa ney kiss tarah kii naukari kii thee kii vaha itane saare logon koo chrismus key liye peris leey jaa sakey. main iss sub key liye usey doshi maanata huun!	muje tho acharya laga ki voh kevin ka dad se work kar raha hein aur voh fly karne ka afford nahi kar saka tho kaafi people paris jaathe christmas ke liye. mein tho usse hi blame karunga
That is true! And plus they housed the entire family the night before their departure.	yeh sach haye! aur saath hii, unake prasthaan seey ack raat pahale unhone poore parivaar koo thaharaaya.	voh tho sach hein! aur uska pura family tho us night mein departure ho gaye hein
How much of rush do you have to be in to forget a whole human being. I guess nobody in the McCallister family was an early bird either. Alarms didn't always exist.	ack poore insan koo bhoolane key liye aapako kitni jaldi karni padati haye. mujhe lagata haye kii mcclister parivaar mein bhee koee bhee praarambhik pakshi naheen thaa. alarm hamesha maujood naheen they.	pura human being ke liye kitna rush karenge. mein tho koi McCallister ka family bird hota tho mein guess nahi kiya.  alarms tho nahi exist hien
No kidding! I wonder that as well! Then they don't even realize he's missing until Kate discovered it during the middle of their flight. So awful!	koee majaak naheen! mujhe bhee ashcharya haye! taba unhein yeh ehsas bhee naheen huaa kii vaha gayab haye jaba taka kett koo unaki udaan key beach mein pataa naheen chalaa. bahut bhayaanak!	are kidding mat karna! mein bhi yeh sab wonder kartha! jab tak koi realize nahi hote tab kate ko koi flight mein nahi hein kar ke. yeh tho awful hein
I couldn't imagine anything other than my child being in danger convincing me to hitch hike with a polka band. I found that part very funny.	main apane bachche key khatare mein honey key alawa kissy aur cheez kii kalpana naheen curr sakata thaa, joe mujhe polka baind key saath paidal yatra karane key liye prerit curr sakey. mujhe vaha hissa bahut majedar lagaa.	muje tho imagine bhi nahi kar saktha ki yeh sab danger tha mera childhood mein lekin voh tho polka band se hitch hike huva. muje tho us part ko badi funny laga
Same here - and in a moving van at that. That was incredibly hilarious!	yahaan bhee vaisa hii - aur chalati vaine mein bhee. vaha avishvasaniya roop seey prafullit karane vaalaa thaa!	yahi bhi- aur voh moving van tho badiya thi. voh tho incredibly hilarious hein
Imagine going through the trouble of flying halfway across the world for a holiday and not even being able to enjoy your time on the trip. That wouldn't be good at all for me I would be so mad.	kalpana keejiye kii aap chhuttiyon key liye duniya bhar mein aadhi udaan bharane kii pareshani seey gujar rahey hain aur yatra key dauran apane samay kaa anand bhee naheen leey paa rahey hain. yeh merey liye bilkul bhee achchha naheen hoga, main bahut krodhit hoe jaaoonga.	soch le agar yeh halfway flying mein troble hein aur jab voh holiday ke liye jaa raha hein lekin usko us time ko enjoy nahi kar saka. tho yeh sab ache nahi hein na yeh tho mad ke tarah hein
I know, right? At that point, I felt sorry for Kate as well. Then on top of that, you can only land a flight to Scranton and while there, all flights to Chicago were booked. Talk about stressful!	mujhe pataa haye, haye naa? usa samay, mujhe kett key liye bhee khed mahsoos huaa. phir usake sheersh parr, aap kewal scranton key liye udaan bhar sakate hain aur vahaan rahate hue, shikago key liye sabhi udaanen book kii gaeen. tanaavpurna key baare mein baat karein!	mujhe pata hai, right? Us point par mujhe Kate ke liye sorry feel huya. Aur uske top par, tum sirf Scranton ki flight land kar sakte ho aur jab tum wahan ho, Chicago ki sari flights book thi. Kitna stressful hai!
For sure very stressful. I wonder what the family was thinking back in Paris at the apartment of Kevin's Uncle.	nishchit roop seey bahut tanaavpurna. mujhe ashcharya haye kii peris mein cavin key ankal key apartment mein parivaar kyaa soch rhaa thaa.	Han sure very stressful. I wonder wo family Paris mein Kevin ke uncle ke apartment mein kya think kar rahi hogi.
Their vacation was certainly ruined while Kevin was in the process of rigging up their house with booby traps for Harry and Marv! That was a hilarious scene as well!	unaki chhuttiyaan nishchit roop seey barbad hoe gaeen, jabaki cavin hairi aur maarv key liye unake ghar koo booby trap seey sajaane kii prakriya mein thaa! vaha bhee ack prafullit karane vaalaa drishya thaa!	Unki vacation certainly ruin hogayi hogi jab Kevin unke house ko booby traps se rig karne ke process mein tha Harry aur Marv ke liye! Wo scene bhi hilarious tha
Kevin was a kid genius. Rigging up the house like mini macgyver. Of course seeing Marv and Harry get tricked was very funny. Thank god Marley got there before Kevin got hurt.	cavin ack pratibhashali bachcha thaa. mini mcgeaver kii tarah ghar koo samvaarnaa. beshak maarv aur hairi koo dhokha khaate dekhana bahut mazedaar thaa. bhagwan kaa shukra haye kii cavin koo chot lagane seey pahale marley vahaan pahunch gayaa.	Kevin kid genius tha. mini macgyver ki tarah house ko rig karne mein. Ofcourse Marv aur Harry ko trick hote dekhna funny tha. Thank god Marley Kevin ke hurt hone se pehle wahan pahunch gaya.
You're right! Thankfully he did get there just in time and the cops came shortly after to arrest Harry and Marv!	aap thheek kaha rahey hain! shukra haye kii vaha thheek samay parr vahaan pahunch gayaa aur pulis kuchh hii dair baad hairi aur maarv koo giraftar karane aaa gaee!	Tum sahi ho! Thankfully wo wahan time par pahunch gaya aur cops thode time mein Harry aur Marv ko arrest karne aa gaye
I love seeing the whole family reunited at the end. Having Kevin realize he didn't want his family to go away was very touching.	mujhe anta mein poore parivaar koo phir seey ekjut hotey dekhana achchha lagata haye. cavin koo yeh ehsas honah kii vaha naheen chaahata kii uska parivaar door jaae, bahut marmic thaa.	Muje whole family ko last mein reunite hote dekhkar kafi accha laga. Kevin ka ye realize karna ki wo apni family ko door nahi jane dena chahta bohat touching tha.
It was - especially after he sees the family was still gone on Christmas day at first before Kate entered the house calling for him.	aisaa thaa - vishesh roop seey taba jaba usane dekhaa kii chrismus key dinn parivaar abhee bhee baahar gayaa huaa thaa, isase pahale kii kett usey bulaate hue ghar mein dakhil hui.	Han wo tha - especially jab wo dekhta hai ki uski family Christmas Day par abhi bhi gayi huyi hai Kate ke ghar mein enter karke bulane se pehle
I do find it a little interesting that no one informed the family about the events that took place while they were gone. I would figure the police might be interested to talk to Kevin's parents.	mujhe yeh thodaa dilchasp lagata haye kii unake chaley jaane key baad kissy ney bhee parivaar koo una ghatnaaon key baare mein naheen bataaya joe ghatit hui theen. mujhe lagata haye kii pulis koo cavin key maataa-pitaa seey baat karane mein dilchaspi hoe sakati haye.	Mujhe ye interesting laga ki kisine family ko nahi inform kiya ki jab wo gaye they tab ghar mein kya events huye. Mujhe lagta hai police shayad Kevin ke parents se baat karne mein interested ho.
I agree but it was hilarious when Buzz yelled "Kevin what did you do to me room?" and Kevin ran off at the end. I enjoyed discussing Home Alone with you today!	main sahmat huun lekin yeh hasyaspad thaa jaba buzz chillaya "cavin tumane merey kamare key saath kyaa kiya?" aur cavin anta mein bhaag gayaa. mujhe aaj aapke saath home alone parr charcha karke anand aayaa!	I agree jab Buzz yell karta hai  "Kevin what did you do to me room?" wo bohat hilarious tha. Aur end me Kevin bhag jata hai. Mujhe aaj tumse Home Alone discuss karke kafi acha laga.

Rotten Tomatoes gave it 97%	mujhe yeh dilchasp lagata haye kii metacritics key paas jozz key liye kewal 87/100 kaa score thaa. ise maapane key liye way kyaa upayog curr rahey they? rotten tomatose ney ise 97% diyaa	mujhe yeh interesting lagta he ki Metacritics ka Jaws ke liye score 87/100 tha.ve ise measure karne ke liye kya use kar rahe the?Rotten Tamataro ne ise 97% diye he.
I know, I don't get that either since it was the best in it's time and still is today, in my opinion.	main jaanata huun, mujhe vaha bhee samajh mein naheen aataa kyonki yeh apane samay mein sarvshreshth thaa aur merrie raay mein aaj bhee haye.	mujhe pata hai, mujhe nahin lagata hai ki ya to yah us samay mein sabase achchha tha aur aaj bhee hai, meree raay mein

I saw that the critics found it funny, in a weird sort of way. I think I kind of agree with that comment. There are moments that are funny, I can't say I agree with your wife, but it did scare some people too much. Maybe it scares her and thats why she hates it.	maine dekhaa kii alochakon koo yeh ajib tarah seey hasyaspad lagaa. mujhe lagata haye kii main usa tippani seey kuchh hudd taka sahmat huun. kuchh aise kshan hain joe mazedaar hain, main yeh naheen kaha sakata kii main aapaki patni seey sahmat huun, lekin isane kuchh logon koo bahut daraa diyaa haye. shayed yeh usey daraata haye aur isiliye vaha isase nafrat karati haye.	mainne dekha ki aalochakon ko yah ajeeb tarah se ajeeb laga. mujhe lagata hai ki main us tippanee se sahamat hoon. aise kshan hain jo majaakiya hain, main yah nahin kah sakata ki main aapakee patnee se sahamat hoon, lekin isane kuchh logon ko bahut dara diya. ho sakata hai ki vah use daraatee hai aur usase napharat karatee hai.
I kind of enjoyed the scary moments in it	maine isamen daraavane kshanon kaa anand liya	mainne isamen daraavane palon ka aanand liya
It's so realistic and it could happen.	yeh bahut yathaarthvaadi haye aur aisaa hoe sakata haye.	yah bahut yathaarthavaadee hai aur aisa ho sakata hai.
It does happen more than you think	jitna aap sochate hain usase kaheen adhik ghatit hotaa haye	yah aapake vichaar se adhik hota hai

In the film the found a tiger shark so they thought the beach was safe. Kind of like when we see a dolphin fin, scream, and then realize it was ok.The next day they see a great white in the same area of the beach. Jaws for real.	film mein unhein ack tiger shark millie, isaliye unhein lagaa kii samudra tata surakshit haye. yeh kuchh-kuchh vaisa hii haye jaise jaba humm ack dolphin pankh dekhate hain, chillaate hain aur phir mahsoos karate hain kii yeh thheek haye. agale dinn unhein samudra tata key usee kshetra mein ack badaa safed pankh dikhaai detaa haye. vaastav mein jabade.	philm mein ek baagh shaark paaya gaya tha taaki unhen laga ki samudr tat surakshit hai. ek tarah se jab ham dolphin phin dekhate hain, chillaate hain, aur tab mahasoos hota hai ki yah theek hai. agale din ve samudr tat ke ek hee kshetr mein ek mahaan saphed dekhate hain. asalee ke lie jabade.
I know, one reason why I try and stay out of the oceans	main jaanata huun, yahee ack kaaran haye kii main mahasagaron seey door rahane kii koshish kartaa huun	mujhe pata hai, ek kaaran hai ki main koshish karata hoon aur mahaasaagaron se baahar rahata hoon
I know theres an alligator hunter that finds and removes those guys. In the movie they paid Quint, Richard Dreyfus to find the shark. Who would do that in real life? Not me!	main jaanata huun kii ack magarmachcha shikari haye joe una logon koo dhoondhata haye aur hataa detaa haye. film mein unhone shark koo khojane key liye quint, richard dreyfus koo bhugtan kiya. vaastavik jeevan mein aisaa kaun karega? mujhe naheen!	mujhe pata hai ki ek magaramachchh shikaaree ko dhoondhata hai aur un logon ko nikaalata hai. shaark ko khojane ke lie philm mein unhonne kvint, richard drephas ko bhugataan kiya. asal jindagee mein kaun aisa karega? main nahin!

No way, I wouldn't either	bilkul naheen, main bhee naheen karunga	koee raasta nahin, main bhee nahin hoga
Nope not at all	naheen bilkul naheen	nahin bilkul nahin
sounds like you're pretty clever! Ironic they named the boat the Orca in the movie. Those Orcas are supposed to be pretty safe.	aisaa lagata haye jaise aap bahut chatur hain! vidambana yeh haye kii unhone film mein naav kaa naam orka rakhaa. way orcas kaafee surakshit maane jaate hain.	lagata hai ki tum bahut chaalaak ho! vidambana hai ki unhonne philm mein naav ka naam orka rakha hai. un orchas bahut surakshit maana jaata hai
Yeah, you know when you hear the music, look out	haan, aap jaanate hain kii jaba aap sangeet sunein, tou baahar dekhein	haan, aap jaanate hain ki jab aap sangeet sunate hain, to baahar dekhen
And can you imagine what it was like getting in a shark proof cage? I know someone who did that once. They said they'd never do it again!	aur kyaa aap kalpana curr sakate hain kii sharkrodhi pinjare mein bund honah kaisa hoga? main kissy aise vyakti koo jaanata huun jisane ack baar aisaa kiya thaa. unhone kahaa kii way aisaa dobara kabhi naheen karenge!	aur kya aap kalpana kar sakate hain ki shaark prooph kej mein aisa kya tha? main kisee aise vyakti ko jaanata hoon jisane ek baar aisa kiya tha. unhonne kaha ki ve ise phir kabhee nahin karenge!
No way! I would have a heart attack	bilkul naheen! mujhe dill kaa daura parh jaayega	bilkul nahin! mujhe dil ka daura padega
Well, at least Jaws had a happy ending. Not for the shark though. The good old days when they made you feel good before you left the movie!	khair, cumm seey cumm jozz kaa sukhad anta huaa. haalaanki shark key liye naheen. achche puraane dinn jaba unhone film chhodane seey pahale aapako achchha mahsoos karaaya thaa!	Jaws  film me khush anth hua. Lekin shark ke liye nahi. pahle dino jaise hame  movie dekar nikalne se pahle acha lagtha hai

Batman intercepts a drug shipment, provides Rachel with evidence against Falcone, and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of the few honest cops left in Gotham, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets with Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham, and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare  him mentally unfit for trial. Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane (which causes Falcone to constantly mouth the  word "Scarecrow"), and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum. While investigating "the Scarecrow", Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into Gotham's water supply. He drugs Rachel with it, but Batman saves her and subdues Crane, who claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administers the antidote, and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. Ducard reappears at Bruce's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him.	batman ack drugg shipment koo rokta haye, rechel koo falcon key khilaf saboot pradaan kartaa haye, aur usey giraftar karane key liye gotham mein bache kuchh imandar puliskarmiyon mein seey ack, sargent james gorden koo shamil kartaa haye. jail mein, falcon kii mulakat ack bhrasht manochikitsak dow. jonathan crain seey hoti haye, jisaki usane gotham mein davaaon kii taskari mein madad kii haye, aur dhamki detaa haye kii aggar usane usey mukadame key liye mansik roop seey ayogya ghoshit naheen kiya tou vaha apani milibhagat kaa khulasa curr dega. crain ack bijuka mukhauta pahanati haye aur falcon parr darr utpann karane vaalaa matibhram chhidakati haye joe usey pagal banaa detee haye (jisake kaaran falcon lagaatar "scarecro" shabd bolata haye), aur usey arkham sharan mein sthanantarit curr diyaa jaataa haye.

Interesting Scarecrow is even in the film. That seems like a lot of plot if they have multiple villans in the film.	dilchasp bijuka film mein bhee haye. yadi film mein kaee khalnayak hain tou yeh kaafee kathaanak jaisa lagata haye.	Film mein Scarecrow bhi bahut dilchasap hai. Tab kafi saare plot lagte hai agr film mein bahut saare villans ho to.
How was the story in your opinion?	aapaki raay mein kahani cassie thee?	Apki raay se story kaisi thi?
It does not crowd the film in my opinion. Unlike how it turned out with Batman and Robin.	merrie raay mein isase film mein bheed naheen hoti. batman aur robbin key saath jaisa huaa usake vipareet.	Mere raay se yeh film ko bhara hua nhi dikhate. Iske vipreet yeh Batman aur Robin ke saath kaise hua.
You can have multiple villians as long as you use them correctly	jaba taka aap unaka sahee dhang seey upayog karate hain taba taka aapke paas ekaadhik villion hoe sakate hain	Tum bahut se villians le skte ho jab tak ki tum unhe achhe se use krte ho
I thought it was a great story. OVerall very solid	mujhe lagaa kii yeh ack behtareen kahani haye. kull milakar bahut thhos	Mujhe lagta tha ki ye ek mahan kahani hai. Kul milaakar bahut solid
I agree,  does the League ever bump heads with Crane in the film?	main sahmat huun, kyaa leag kabhi film mein crain seey takaraati haye?	Han main sehmat huin, kya Leagu kabhi film mein Cran ke saath sir kaatte hai?
Or do they work together?	yaa kyaa way ack saath kaam karate hain?	Aur kya ve ek saath kaam karte hai?
Yes, and it fits naturally.	haan, aur yeh swaabhaavik roop seey fitt baithata haye.	Han, aur yeh svaabhaavik roop se fit baithta hai.

Yeah - I wanted to talk about it because I like how David Fincher directed it.	haan - main isake baare mein baat karna chaahata thaa kyonki mujhe yeh pasand aayaa kii david fincture ney ise kaise nirdeshit kiya.	Yeah - me uske baare me baat karna chahta hun, jaise David Fincher ne ise direct kiya mujhe pasand aaya.
ok	thheek haye	Ok
Did you see it?	aapane ise dekhaa thaa?	kya aap dekha?
did you enjoy it	kyaa aapako yeh achchha lagaa	kya aap enjoy kiya
yes i did	haan maine kiya	haan yar
Yeah, a lot. Sorkin and Fincher sure laced their scathing wit with an aching sadness, you know? I guess everybody says that, though.	haan bahut. sorkin aur fincture ney nishchit roop seey apani teekhi buddhi key saath ack dukhdaayi udasi bhee jodd dee haye, kyaa aap jaanate hain? haalaanki, mujhe lagata haye kii harr koee aisaa kahata haye.	bahut yar.. sorkin aur fincher tho apni aching sadness ko tho badiya scathing kare.. aapko patha hein? i guess ki sabhi aise hi sochthe honge..
ok, i wasnt aware it was based on a book	thheek haye, mujhe naheen pataa thaa kii yeh kissy kitab parr adharit haye	ok, muje iska koi aware nahi hein.. lekin yeh book ke based hoga
Yeah. Though I guess the movie isn't quite as factual as the book? And that the book is pretty heavily debated.	haan. haalaanki mujhe lagata haye kii film kitab jitani tathyaatmak naheen haye? aur iss kitab parr kaafee bahas hui haye.	haan.. book se compare kare tho yeh movie itna bhi ache nahi hein kyon? aur book tho heavily debated tha
I see	achchha aisaa haye	acha
You remember that bit where Zuckerberg gets dumped and then writes a mean post about his ex?	kyaa aapako vaha ansh yaad haye jahaan jukerberg koo chhod diyaa jaataa haye aur phir vaha apani poorv premika key baare mein ghatiya post likhate hain?	aapko yaad hein ki zuckerberg tho kuch samai dumped tha aur voh apne ex se badi mean tha
Im not a fan of facebook or zukerbeg, but I thought the movie was well done.   I dont remember that part specifically	main facebook yaa jukerberg kaa prashansak naheen huun, lekin mujhe lagaa kii film achchi bunny haye. mujhe vaha bhaag vishesh roop seey yaad naheen haye	mein zukerberg ka fan nahi hoon, lekin movie tho badiya nikla.. muje uska yaad kuch nahi aatha
Yeah, no, I'm no fan of either, either. But it was that scene that kind said everything that needed to be said about the mentality behind that site. I thought that was pretty brilliant.	haan, naheen, main kissy kaa bhee prashansak naheen huun. lekin yeh vaha drishya thaa jisane usa site key peechhe kii mansikta key baare mein vaha sub kuchh kaha diyaa joe kahaa jaanaa aavashyak thaa. maine socha kii yeh bahut shandar thaa.	haan yar, mein bhi uska fan nahi hoon.. lekin is scene mein tho kuch aise dekhaya gaya hein ki voh usse mentaly lead kar raha hein.. voh tho brilliant hein.
it seems to be highly rated	aisaa lagata haye kii ise uchch darja diyaa gayaa haye	ye kafi high rated dikhti hai
Yeah. It's definitely a strong movie. I mean, it's a movie about Facebook that is actually watchable. That's saying something.	haan. yeh nishchit roop seey ack sashakt film haye. meraa matlab haye, yeh facebook key baare mein ack film haye joe vaastav mein dekhane yogya haye. vaha kuchh kaha rhaa haye.	Han. ye definitely ek strong movie hai. Mera matlab, ye facebook par aisi movie hai jo watchable hai. Bahut badi baat hai.
yes Iwas thinking that as well	haan main bhee yahee soch rhaa thaa	han main bhi yahi soch raha tha.
it is even more trajic where it has brought us politically	yeh aur bhee dukhad haye kii isane hamein raajneetik roop seey kahaan pahuncha diyaa haye	ye aur bhi tragic hai ki ye hume politically kahan le aya
For sure. And I feel like it's all in that bit where Sean Parker has his line about "You know what IS cool? A billion dollars." Like, it's presented as a way to keep people in touch, but it's really the coldest corporate-type of thing.	pakka. aur mujhe aisaa lagata haye kii yeh sub usa ansh mein haye jahaan shaun parker kii apani pankti haye "aap jaanate hain kii kyaa achchha haye? ack arab dollar." jaise, ise logon koo sampark mein rakhane key ack tareeke key roop mein prastut kiya gayaa haye, lekin yeh vaastav mein sabse thhandi corporate-prakaar kii cheez haye.	sach mein. Aur mujhe lagta hai ye sab usme bit mein hai jahan Sean Parker ki line hai "You know what IS cool? A billion dollars.". Like, ye aise way mein presented hai ki people touch mein rahein, par ye really bohat cold-corporate type ki thing hai
yes greed is powerfull	haan lalach shaktishali haye	han greed powerful hai
Did you know Sean Parker was the founder of Napster?	kyaa aap jaanate hain seane parker napster key sansthaapak they?	kya tum jante ho Sean Parker Napster ka founder tha
yes	haan	yes
it is interesting how he suggested getting rid of "the"	yeh dilchasp haye kii unhone "dha" seey chhutkara paane kaa sujhaav kaise diyaa	ye interesting hai kaise usne 'the' se rid karne ka suggest.
Yes! I was just about to say that.  I think it's crazy how much influence he had on Facebook when it started out.	haan! main bhee abhee yahee kahane vaalaa thaa.  mujhe lagata haye kii yeh ajib baat haye kii jaba facebook shuru huaa tou usa parr uska kitna prabhaav thaa.	han! main wahi bolne wala tha. Mujhe lagta hai ye crazy hai uske pas kitna zyada influence tha jab facebook start hua.
Then there's that last scene, where Zuckerberg keeps refreshing his page to see if his ex-girlfriend has accepted his friend request. That's what it all comes back to. After all the greed, you've still got these human needs.	phir vaha aakhiri drishya haye, jahaan jukerberg yeh dekhane key liye apana pays refreshes karate rahate hain kii kyaa unaki poorv premika ney unaki friend request sweekar curr lii haye. yeh sub usee parr vaapas aataa haye. tamaam lalach key baad bhee, aapke paas yeye maanviya zarooraten hain.	Aur ek last sceme hai, jahan Zuckerberg apne page ko refresh karta rahta hai yeh dekhne ke liye ki kya uske ex-girlfriend ne uska friend request accept kiya hai ya nahin. Last mein yehi sab hota hai. Saare greed ke baad, tumhe human needs ki zaroorat hai.
it is interesting for sure	yeh nishchit roop seey dilchasp haye	Hann. Yeh zaroor interesting hai.
it would be funny if it was still called f acemash	yadi ise abhee bhee f acemash kahaa jaataa tou yeh hasyaspad hotaa	Bahut funny hota agar ise abhi bhi facemash kaha jaata.
I know, that was a pretty weird name. Even 'Facebook' seemed weird back in the day.	main jaanata huun, vaha bahut ajib naam thaa. yahaan taka ​​kii 'facebook' bhee pahale ajib lagata thaa.	Mujhe pata hai ki woh ek achcha weird naam tha.  Un dino mein Facebook bhi weird hua karta tha.
i think it is a dangerous false reality that has changed humanity for  the worse	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh ack khatarnak jhoothi vaastaviktaa haye jisane manavata koo badatar key liye badal diyaa haye	Mujhe lagta hai yeh ek khatarnak flase reality hai jisne humanity ko bilkul badal diya hai.
millions are addicted to it, and it is proven to shape perceptions in false ways	lakhon loga isake aadee hain, aur yeh galat tarikon seey dhaaranaon koo aakaar dene vaalaa saabit huaa haye	Lakhon log iske peeche addicted hain and maana jaata hai ki yeh perceptions ko galat tareeke se shape karta hai.
Yeah, I think so, too. Though I also think there is a natural balance of humanity and that at some point Facebook will be left in the dust. Or at least it's worst aspects will be. Again, I just think about that last scene. Maybe it's too optimistic, but I think people will abandon Facebook. Maybe not this generation, but the next.	haan, main bhee aisaa hii sochata huun. haalaanki mujhe yeh bhee lagata haye kii manavata kaa ack swaabhaavik santulan haye aur kissy samay facebook dhool mein mill jaayega. yaa cumm seey cumm isake sabse burey pahalu tou honge hii. phir, main buss usa aakhiri drishya key baare mein sochata huun. shayed yeh bahut ashawadi haye, lekin mujhe lagata haye kii loga facebook chhod denge. shayed iss peedhi koo naheen, agali peedhi koo.	Haan, mujhe bhi aisa hi lagta hai.  Par mujhe aisa bhi lagta hai ki humanity ka ek natural balance bhi hai magar kabhi na kabhi Facebook dust mein mil jayega.  Ya, kam se kam uske worst aspects dust mein honge.  Main phie se us last sceme ke baare mein sochta hoon.  Ho sakta hai main bahut optimistic hoon, but mere khayal se log Facebook abandon kar denge.  Yeh generation nahin to agla generation.
Was there anything you didn't like about the movie?	kyaa film mein kuchh aisaa thaa joe aapako pasand naheen aayaa?	Movie mein kya aisa kuch tha jo tumne like nahin kiya?
it seems to be in that direction to some point already.  a lot of damage has been done though	aisaa lagata haye kii yeh pahale seey hii kuchh hudd taka usa disha mein haye.  haalaanki bahut nuksan huaa haye	Haan, kuch had tak mujhe laga ki us direction mein ja raha hai.  Kaafi had tak damage to ho chuka hai.
I think we are done now, have a good day	mujhe lagata haye kii abb hamara kaam hoe gayaa, aapka dinn shubh hoe	I think baat khatam ho gayi.  Tumhara din achcha ho.
Okay, You too!	thheek haye, aap bhee!	Okay, tum bhi!

Hello so the movie we will be talking about is Batman V. Superman	namaskar, tou humm jiss film key baare mein baat curr rahey hain vaha haye batman vee. superman	Hello to hum aaj jis movie k baare me baat karege wo hai Batman V Superman
Great! I haven't actually seen that yet, but have been really wanting to. Which actors play Batman and Superman?	mahaan! maine vaastav mein ise abhee taka naheen dekhaa haye, lekin vaastav mein dekhana chaahata huun. kaun seey abhineta batman aur superman kii bhoomika nibhaate hain?	Great, maine abhi tak wo dekhi nahi hai, but sahi me dekhna chahta hu. Batman aur Superman kaun actors bane hai?
The actors are really great and you probably know all of them. Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, and Jesse Eisenberg to name a few.	abhineta vaastav mein mahaan hain aur aap shayed una sabhi koo jaanate hain. bayne affleck, heinry caville, ammy addams aur jessy easenberg unamen seey kuchh key naam hain.	Actor bohot aache hai, aur tum shaiyad sabko jante ho. Ben affleck, henry cavill, amy adams, aur jesse eisenberg kuch naam hai
Oh, that is a great cast? Henry Cavill played Superman in the latest Superman film right?	oh, yeh ack mahaan kalakar haye? heinry caville ney navintam superman film mein superman kii bhoomika nibhai haye naa?	Oh ye to bohot aachi cast hai? Henry cavill ne superman ka kirdaar nibhaya tha na latest superman film me?
Sorry, a great cast!	kshama karein, bahut badhiya kalakar!	Maaf karna, ek aachi cast!
I am not sure but the film is still a part of the DC extended universe. Also it will be featuring wonder woman.	mujhe yakeen naheen haye lekin film abhee bhee dc vistaarit brahmand kaa ack hissa haye. saath hii isamen wonder women bhee hogi.	Mai nahi bol sakta lekin film ek part hai DC extended universe ka. Aur vo naya kirdar wonder women bhi dikhayenge
Ooh, that is excellent. I am looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman! Are Batman and Superman enemies at the start of the film?	oh, yeh tou bahut badhiya haye. main wonder women koo dekhane key liye utsuk huun! kyaa film kii shuruat mein batman aur superman dushman hain?	Ye to kaafi aacha hai. Mai wonder women ko deekhna chahunga! Kyaa batman aur superman dushman hai movie chalu hote samay
Well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with Superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman.	khair, lakes luther ney batman koo superman key saath ladaai mein herfer kiya kyonki vaha superman kii cloning karane kaa jununi haye.	Kyaa lex luthor uksayega batman ko ek ladai ke liye superman ke saath kyunki vo obssessed hai clone superman se
Oh! So Batman is supposed to bring Superman to Lex Luthor?	oh! tou kyaa batman koo superman koo lakes luther key paas laanaa chaahiye?	Oh! batman superman ko lex luthor ke paas lekar jata hai
No that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping. By the way did I mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together?	naheen, aisaa naheen haye phir bhee usey madad karane key liye uksaayaa jaataa haye. vaise, kyaa maine bataaya kii yeh pahali baar hoga jaba batman aur superman ack saath kissy film mein honge?	Nahi ye case nahi hai jabki vo uksata hai madat karne ko. Kyaa maine bataya ke ye pehli baar hai ke batman aur superman ek saath movie me hai?
Really? The first time? That seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long! Very cool. Is the story set in Metropolis or Gotham?	vaastav mein? pahali baar? yeh jaankar bahut aashcharyajanak lagata haye kii paatr itane lambe samay seey maujood hain! bahut hii shaant. kyaa kahani metropolis yaa gotham parr adharit haye?	Sahi me? Pehli baar? Ye kaafi aacha sunai deta hai ke kirdaar aas paas rahe hai itne samay se! Kaafi aacha. Ye story metropolis me hai ya gotham me?
The film appears to take place in both cities, and Batman comes to view Superman as a threat to humanity.	aisaa prateet hotaa haye kii film donon shaharon mein ghatit hoti haye, aur batman superman koo manavata key liye khatare key roop mein dekhane lagata haye.	Film dono jagah hoti hai, aur batman superman ko ek khatre ke tarah deekhta hai manavta ke liye
That is interesting, to have the film set in both cities. So Batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take Superman down?	donon shaharon mein film kaa sett honah dilchasp haye. tou batman superman koo neeche girana kuchh hudd taka apana kartavya maanata haye?	Yeh interesting hai, dono cities mein film set hona. to Batman ne Superman ko neecha le jana kuch hadd tak apni duty mani hai?
Well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because Clark Kent A.K.A. Superman learns of Batman's justice methods and tries to expose him. All this happening while Lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator.	vaise paatron key rishte kaafee jatil hain kyonki clark kent aii.key.aii. superman batman key nyaay key tarikon koo seekhata haye aur usey benkab karane kii koshish kartaa haye. yeh sub taba hoe rhaa haye jaba lakes luther ack senator seey cryptonite praapt karane key liye anumodan praapt karane key liye kadam uthaa rhaa haye.	Khair characters ke relationships kafi complex hai kyunki  Clark Kent A.K.A. Superman Batman ke justice krne ke tarike sikh gya hai or use expose krne ki koshish krta hai. Ye sab tab hota hai jan Lex Luthor ek senator se kryptonite lene ka approval lene ke liye chaalein chalta hai.
Interesting. And so, I imagine Lois Lane is in this story? If so, does she serve a greater purpose? Does she know both superheroes?	dilchasp. aur isaliye, mujhe lagata haye kii lois laine iss kahani mein haye? yadi haan, tou kyaa vaha kissy badey uddeshya kii poorti karati haye? kyaa vaha donon superheiro koo jaanati haye?	Dilachasp. Aur isliye, mujhe lagta hai ki kahani mein Lois Lane hai? Agar aisa hai to, kya wo koi bada purpose serve kr rahi hai? Kya use dono superheroes ke baare mein pta hai?
Maybe but I am not sure. By the way do you usually care about reviews?	hoe sakata haye lekin mujhe yakeen naheen haye. vaise kyaa aap aamtaur parr sameekshaon kii parwah karate hain?	Shayad but main sure nhi huin. Vaise tum aamataur par reviews ki paravaah karte ho?
I will often read reviews to see what people have to say, but I don't change my mind about wanting to see a movie based on reviews. I think that I can't really know unless I see for myself. Do you care about reviews?	main aksar yeh dekhane key liye sameekshaaen padhata huun kii logon koo kyaa kahana haye, lekin main sameekshaon key aadhar parr film dekhane key baare mein apana vichaar naheen badalata. mujhe lagata haye kii main vaastav mein taba taka naheen zaan sakata jaba taka main khud naheen dekh letaa. kyaa aapako sameekshaon kii parwah haye?	Main aksar reviews ko padhta hoon ki logon ka kya kahana hai, lekin main reviews ke aadhaar par movie dekhne ke baare mein apana mann nahin badalata huin. Mujhe lagata hai ki main vaastav mein tab tak nahin jaan sakta jab tak ki main kud se nahi dekhta. Kya tum reviews ki paravaah karte ho?
Not usually I like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not I watch in theatres. I have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed.	aamtaur parr main apana khud kaa jaj banana pasand naheen kartaa, halanki aggar sameekshaaen bahut buri yaa achchi hain tou yeh prabhaavit curr sakata haye kii main cinemagharon mein dekhunga yaa naheen. mujhe inn filmon key baare mein kahana hoga halanki sameekshaaen kaafee mishrit hain.	Aamataur par main apana khud ka judge banna pasand karta huin lekin agar reviews bahut bure ya achhe hai to yeh influence kar sakta hai ki main cinema main dekhta hoon ya nahin. Mujhe is movie ke lie kehna hoga, haalaanki reviews kaafi mixed hai.
Did you enjoy this film?	kyaa aapane iss film kaa anand liya?	Kya tumne ye film enjoy ki?
I did. I really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman.	maine kiya. mujhe way drishya dekhana bahut pasand aayaa jahaan batman superman koo apane vash mein karane mein kamyab hotaa haye.	Han. Mujhe vaastav mein un scenes ko dekhna pasand tha jahaan batman superman ko vash mein karne ke arrangements karta hai.
Cool. I guess that's one of the ultimate questions, which one could beat out the other. Do they team up at all in the film ?	thandaa. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh antim prashnon mein seey ack haye, joe ack dusare koo maat dey sakata haye. kyaa way film mein bilkul bhee team banaate hain?	Badiya. Mujhe lagata hai ki yeh param savaalon mein se ek hai, kaun dusre ko hara sakta hai. Kya ve film mein team up krte hai?
Yes in Batman chooses to save Supermans mother while Superman confonts Lex.	haan, batman superman kii maan koo bachaane kaa vikalp chunata haye jabaki superman lakes kaa saamana kartaa haye.	Han Batman Superman ki maa ko bachaane ko chunta hai jabaki superman Lex ka saamana karta hai.
Oh wow! The pairing of Batman and Superman's mom is a really cool part of the story, heartwarming.	arey vaah! batman aur superman kii maan kii jodee vaastav mein kahani kaa ack achchha hissa haye, dill chhoo lene vaali haye.	tho acha hein! yeh tho batman aur superman ka mummy ka pairing hein jo bahut cool hein aur heartwarming hein
I know but the film ends with sadly the death of Superman.	main jaanata huun lekin film dukhad roop seey superman kii mrityu key saath samaapt hoti haye.	muje patha tha lekin is film ka end tho superman ka mouth tho bada sad huva
Oh wow! I am surprised by that, I thought they would keep their story line going for another movie or two.	arey vaah! main isase aashcharyachakit huun, maine socha thaa kii way apani kahani koo ack yaa dou filmon key liye jaari rakhenge.	are vah! mein tho surprised huva, lekin mein soch raha hoon ki is story line tho dusra movie se likha gaya hein
Dont worry the dirt on top of the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the Director.	chinta naa karein, taaboot key oopar kii gandagi seey nirdeshak ney ack achchi palak jhapkaai.	coffin ka vibrates ke baare mein koi worry na kare. kyon ki is wink us director ka hein
Haha! That's the closing shot?!	haaha! vaha samaapan shott haye?!	ha ha.. yeh tho closing shot nikhla
I believe so it is in the last scene.	meraa maanana ​​haye kii yeh antim drishya mein haye.	mein believe kartha ki voh last scene se hein
Awesome! Take care.	bahut badhiya! apana dhyaan rakhna.	awesome yar.. dhyan rakhna

Jesse Eisenberg fit the part very well too.	pradarshan bahut badhiya they. justine timberlake naa kewal ack pratibhashali gaayak hain balki ack bahut achche abhineta bhee hain. jessy easenberg bhee iss bhoomika mein bahut achche seey fitt baithate hain.	pradarshan bahut achha tha. justin timberlake na sirf ek achha singer hain ,ek achha actor bhee hai. jesse Eisenberg bhi apna bhaag achi tarah nibaya

Hi. I was saying how Justin Timberlake and Jesse Eisenberg were pretty good actors.	namaste. main kaha rhaa thaa kii justine timberlake aur jessy easenberg kitane achche abhineta they.	Hi, main keh raha tha kaise Justin Timberlake aurJesse Eisenberg kaafi ache actors hain
Yeah. He's better than I thought he would be.	haan. maine jitna socha thaa vaha usase kaheen behtar haye.	Yeah. maine jaisa socha tha wo usse better hai
I'm not usually into Biographies	main aamtaur parr jeevaniyon mein ruchi naheen rakhta	main aksar Biographies main dilchaspi nahi leta
Me neither but this one was pretty good.	main bhee naheen lekin yeh bahut achchha thaa.	Me neither,lekin ye kaafi achi thi
But this one is probably a decent one to watch	lekin yeh shayed dekhane laayak achchha haye	lekin shayad ye dekhne ke liye decent  hai
It's crazy how fast Fb blew up	yeh pagalpan haye kii facebook kitni teji seey fail gayaa	It's crazy kaise jaldi Fb udh gaya
It would be interesting to watch the film	film dekhana dilchasp hoga	film dekhna interesting hoga
It is. I didn't think Mark Zuckerberg had a very interesting life but I guess he has.	yeh haye. maine naheen socha thaa kii maark jukerberg kaa jeevan bahut dilchasp thaa, lekin mujhe lagata haye kii unaka jeevan bahut dilchasp haye.	yeh aise hi hei.. muje nahi lagtha ki Mark Zuckerberg ke paas interesting life hoga
Facebook is a monster.	facebook ack rakshas haye.	Facebook tho yek monster hein
I don't think most people could live without it at this point in time.	mujhe naheen lagata kii iss samay adhikansh loga isake binaa reh sakate hain.	muje nahi lagtha ki uske bina koi log jee nahi sakthe.

It's kind of messed up though.

The movie doesn't really go into that though.

more of a documentary  of sorts.	ack tarah kii documentary seey bhee adhik.	Documentary of sorts se jyada
It started out as a simple chat to help college students with dating but turned into something much bigger.	isaki shuruat college key chhaatron koo detting mein madad karane key liye ack sadharan chait key roop mein hui thee lekin baad mein yeh bahut badee hoe gaee.	Ye ek Simple chat se start hua jo ki college students ki dating me help karne ke liye tha but ye kuch bahut bade me turn ho gaya

The first part of the movie, explaining how the sisters were orphaned, and how their circumstances drove them apart was tragic, but I do like how everything wrapped up in the end.	film kaa pahala bhaag, jisamen bataaya gayaa haye kii kaise bahanen anath hoe gaeen aur kaise unaki paristhitiyon ney unhein alag curr diyaa, dukhad thaa, lekin mujhe yeh pasand haye kii anta mein sub kuchh kaise khatm hoe gayaa.	pratham ansh ka chalachitr , samajhaana bahanon ko kaise anaath the , aur kaise unake haalaat unhen alag kar diya dukhad tha, lekin mujhe pasand hai kaise sab kuchh ant mein lapeta hua

What is your rating for Frozen?	frozen key liye aapaki rating kyaa haye?	phrojan ke lie aapakee reting kya hai?
The document is growing, and additional detailed information about scenes from the movie were just added.  I'm reminded of the scene where Elsa builds her ice palace.  It was an impressive bit of computer generated animation.	dastaavez badh rhaa haye, aur film key drishyon key baare mein atirikt vistrit jaankaari abhee jodee gaee haye.  mujhe vaha drishya yaad aaa rhaa haye jahaan elsa apana burf kaa mahal banaati haye.  yeh computer janit animation kaa ack prabhaavshaali namuna thaa.	dastaavez badh raha hai, aur philm ke drshyon ke baare mein atirikt vistrt jaanakaaree bas jod dee gaee. mujhe us drshy kee yaad aa rahee hai jahaan elsa apane barph ke mahal ka nirmaan karatee hai. yah kampyootar dvaara utpann eneemeshan ka ek prabhaavashaalee sa tha.

Yeah, the animation was outstanding	haan, animation utkrisht thaa	haan, eneemeshan bakaaya tha
My favorite scene is when Anna gets hitby Elsa  at the very beginning.	meraa pasandida drishya vaha haye jaba enaa shuruat mein hii elsa seey takra jaati haye.	mera pasandeeda drshy tab hai jab shuruaat mein hee ena ne elsa ko hit kar diya.

What is zootopia about?	zootopia kiss baare mein haye?	Kis ke baare mein hai Zootopia
Its about an optimistic rabbit that joins the Zootopia Police Department. While out she runs into a red fox that is also a small time con artist played by Jason Bateman. The movie follows their adventure Zootopia.	yeh ack ashawadi khargosh key baare mein haye joe zootopia pulis vibhaag mein shamil hoe jaataa haye. baahar nikalate samay usaki mulakat ack laal lomdi seey hoti haye, joe jayson betman dwara nibhaaya gayaa ack chhote samay kaa chor kalakar bhee haye. film unake saahasik zootopia parr adharit haye.	Yeh ek Optimistic Rabbit ke baar mein hai Zootopia Police Department join karta hai. jobki woh ek red fox chalati hai aur woh ek small time con artist bhi hai jisko Jason Bateman ne play kiya hai.  Movie uske Zootopia adventure ko follow karti hai
that sounds really interesting. How does the movie end?	yeh sachmuch dilchasp lagata haye. film kaa anta kaise hotaa haye?	yeh sunne mein toh bhaut interesting hai.  Movie ka end kaisa hai
would you watch it again?	kyaa aap ise dobara dekhenge?	Kya tum dubara dekhoge?
I would watch it again. I saw it in theaters so I am not positive on how it ends but i know that it ends with the Rabbit officer proving that she may be small but she wont be intimidated and will do her job to the best of her abilities.	main ise dobara dekhunga. maine ise cinemagharon mein dekhaa thaa, isaliye main iss baare mein sakaratmak naheen huun kii iska anta kaise hoga, lekin mujhe pataa haye kii iska anta rabit officer key yeh saabit karane key saath hotaa haye kii vaha chhoti hoe sakati haye, lekin vaha bhayabheet naheen hogi aur apani kshamataon key anusaar apana kaam karegi.	Han main dubara dekhunga. Maine ye theater mein dekhi thi so main sahi se nhi bta skta ki ye end kaise hui but mujhe ye pta hai ki ye rabbit officer ke saath end hui thi jo ye saabit krta hai ki wo chhoti ho skti hai par dari hui nhi ho skti or apni ability ke according kam karegi.
she sounds like a great officer.	vaha ack mahaan adhikaari kii tarah lagati haye.	Wo ek mahan officer ki tarah sound krti hai.
She was quite inspiring.	vaha kaafee preranadayak thee.	Wo kafi inspire karti hai
who plays all the voices in the movie?	film mein sabhi aavaazen kaun bajaata haye?	Film mein saari awaazein kisne di hai?
Ginnifer Goodwin is Officer Judy Hopps, Jason Bateman plays Nick Wilde, Idris Elba is Chief Bogo, and Jenny Slate is Dawn Bellwether.	ginifer goodwin adhikaari judie hopes hain, jayson betman nick wild kii bhoomika nibhaate hain, idris elba cheef bogo hain, aur jenny slate donn belvedar hain.	Officer Judy Hopps ki Ginnifer Goodwin ne, Nick Wilde ki Jason Bateman ne, Chief Bogo ki Idris Elba ne or Dawn Bellwether ki Jenny Slate ne awaaz di hai.
those are all great voices. Do you think this movie is okay for kids?	way sabhi mahaan aavaajen hain. kyaa aapako lagata haye kii yeh film bachchon key liye thheek haye?	Yeh sabhi awaazein bahut mahaan hai. Kya tujhe lagta hai ki ye fim bachon ke liye sahi hai?
I think it is a great movie for kids and adults alike.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh bachchon aur vayaskon donon key liye ack behtareen film haye.	Mujhe lagta hai ki yeh movie bachon or adults dono ke liye achhi hai.
would you consider it to be a comedy?	kyaa aap ise comedy maanenge?	Kya tum ise comedy ki samjh skte ho?
Yes.	haan.	Han.
would you recommend it to your best friend?	kyaa aap apane sabse achche dost koo isaki anushansa karenge?	Kya tum recommend it to your best friend?
Yes.	haan.	Haan yes
do you think that they will make a second movie of this?	kyaa aapako lagata haye kii way isaki doosari film banaayenge?	Kya tumhe lagta hain ki they will make a second movie of this?
There is some potential for a second movie. But I am not sure what they would use for a premise.	doosari film kii kuchh sambhaavanaaen hain. lekin mujhe yakeen naheen haye kii way kissy parisar key liye kyaa upayog karenge.	There is some potential for a second movie. Par I am not sure iski prishthbhumi ke liye what they  would use.
thats very true, a sequal is easier said than done.	yeh bilkul sach haye, seekwal key baare mein kahana jitna aasaan haye, karane mein utana aasaan naheen haye.	Ekdum sahi, a sequal is easier said than done.
They cannot try to use the little guy beats the big guy in the next one since the officer proved her self already.	way yeh prayog karane kii koshish naheen curr sakate kii agale mein chhota aadami badey aadami koo haraa detaa haye kyonki adhikaari ney pahale hii khud koo saabit curr diyaa haye.	Woh cannot try to use the little guy beats the big guy in the next one kyunki officer proved her self already.
maybe a little guy can beat the officer	shayed ack chhota aadami adhikaari koo haraa sakata haye	Ho sakta hai ki little guy beat the officer
like the rocket snail	rockett ghonghe kii tarah	Rocket snail ki tarah.
That could be true, but do we want to see a movie where the bad guy wins?	yeh sach hoe sakata haye, lekin kyaa humm aisee film dekhana chaahte hain jisamen buraa aadami jeet jaae?	Woh sahi ho sakta hai, but kya hum want to see a movie where the bad guy wins?
true but than they could make a third movie where the officer learns how to defeat the guy eventually.	sach haye, lekin way ack teesari film banaa sakate hain jahaan adhikaari seekhata haye kii antatah usa vyakti koo kaise haraaya jaae.	Sahi hai but than they could make a third movie jahan officer learns bure logo ko kaisse defeat kare..
I see your point. I fear that you may dissuade people from watching a third movie if they were put off from seeing the villain win in the second movie.	tumhari baat sahee haye. mujhe darr haye kii aggar aap logon koo doosari film mein khalnayak koo jeetate dekhane seey rokenge tou aap unhein teesari film dekhane seey hatotsaahit curr denge.	I see your point. Lekin kujhe darr hai ki you may dissuade people from watching a third movie agar unko second movie mein villian ka jeetna pasand nahi aaya .

Hi	namaste	Hi
Hello	namaste	Hello
So what movie are talking about ?	tou kiss film kii baat curr rahey hain?	To hum kis movie ke baare mein baat kar rahe hain?
The Wolf of Wall Street	wall street key bhediye	The Wolf of Wall Street
Oh, I have heard a lot about that movie	oh, maine usa film key baare mein bahut kuchh sunaa haye	Oh maine is movie ke bare mein kafi suna hai
I have never actually seen this movie so what I am reading is all I know about it. Personally it does not seem like a movie I would like. It seems boring and it was given a Cinema Score of C so that might support my opinion.	maine vaastav mein yeh film kabhi naheen dekhi haye isaliye main joe padh rhaa huun vaha buss isake baare mein jaanata huun. vyaktigat taur parr yeh aisee film naheen lagati joe mujhe pasand aaye. yeh ubaau lagata haye aur ise c kaa cinema score diyaa gayaa taaki merrie raay kaa samarthan hoe sakey.	Maine actually kabhi ye movie nahi dekhi to jo maine padha hai mujhe wahi pata hai.  Personally ye aisi movie nahi lagti jo mujhe chi lage. Ye boring lagti hai aur isey C Cinema Score mila to shayad ye mere opinion ko support karta hai.
Oh okay. Who are the lead actors ?	oh thheek haye. mukhya abhineta kaun hain?	Oh okay. lead actors kon hain?
It says the genre is a "black comedy". Do you know what that is because I do not. I'm thinking it is a "dark" comedy as in mood and attitude and not racial.	isamen kahaa gayaa haye kii yeh shally ack "black comedy" haye. kyaa aap jaanate hain kii vaha kyaa haye kyonki main naheen jaanata. main soch rhaa huun kii manodasha aur drishtikon key anusaar yeh ack "dark" comedy haye aur nasliya naheen haye.	ye to kehti hai ki iska genre "black comedy" hai. Kya tumhe pata hai kyunki mujhe nahi pata, mujhe lag raha hai ye as in mood and attitude "dar" comedy hai na ki racial.
The lead actors are Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Kyle Chandler, and Rob Reiner. I do not know who Kyle Chandler is.	mukhya kalakar leonardo dicaprio, jonah hill, margot robby, kyle chandler aur robb rainer hain. main naheen jaanata kii kyle chandler kaun haye.	lead actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Kyle Chandler, and Rob Reiner hain. Mujhe nahi pata Kyle Chandler kon hain.
There are big names	badey naam hain	ye bade naam hain
I see it was based on a true story.	main dekhta huun kii yeh ack sachchi kahani parr adharit thee.	I see ki ye tre story pe based hai
Leonardo was nominated for Oscar for this.	isake liye leonardo koo auskar key liye namankit kiya gayaa thaa.	Leonardo iske liye Oscar nominate hua
Where are you located ?	aap kahaan hain ?	AAP KAHAAN HAIN?
Oh he is a good actor, probably deserved it.	oh, vaha ack achche abhineta hain, shayed isake hakdar hain.	OH VAH EK ACHCHHE ABHINETA HAIN, SHAAYAD ISAKE HAKADAAR HAIN.
I'm located in Maryland. I thought we aren't suppose to give personal information.	main maryland mein sthit huun. maine socha kii hamein vyaktigat jaankaari naheen deni chaahiye.	MAIN MAIREELAIND MEIN STHIT HOON. MAINNE SOCHA THA KI HAM VYAKTIGAT JAANAKAAREE DENE KE LIE NAHIN HAIN.
Wolf of Wall street is pretty famous in the US.	wolf off wall street america mein kaafee mashur haye.	VULPH OPH VOL SADAK AMERIKA MEIN BAHUT PRASIDDH HAI.
It just seemed a little bizarre to me that someone didn't know that movie,so I asked.	yeh mujhe thodaa ajib lagaa kii koee usa film koo naheen jaanata thaa, isaliye maine poochha.	YAH SIRPH MUJHE THODA VICHITR LAGA KI KOEE US PHILM KO NAHIN JAANATA HAI, ISALIE MAINNE POOCHHA.
Yes. I've heard of it but never seen it. I like action movies.	haan. maine isake baare mein sunaa haye lekin kabhi dekhaa naheen. mujhe action filmein pasand hain.	HAAN. MAINNE ISAKE BAARE MEIN SUNA HAI LEKIN ISE KABHEE NAHIN DEKHA. MUJHE EKSHAN PHILMEN PASAND HAIN.
Okay. I recommend trying to watch it, it's a great movie.	thheek haye. main ise dekhane kaa prayas karane kii salah detaa huun, yeh ack behtareen film haye.	THEEK HAI. MAIN ISE DEKHANE KEE KOSHISH KARANE KEE SALAAH DETA HOON, YAH EK BEHATAREEN PHILM HAI.
I think my husband and daughter have watched it buy not me. Again, I like action movies but my husband loves watching gangster and comedies. He always teases me that I only want to watch action movies for the actors.	mujhe lagata haye kii maine naheen balki merey pati aur betty ney ise khareedate hue dekhaa haye. phir, mujhe action filmein pasand hain lekin merey pati koo gangster aur comedy filmein dekhana pasand haye. vaha hamesha mujhe chidhaate hain kii main kewal abhinetaon key liye action filmein dekhana chaahata huun.	MUJHE LAGATA HAI KI MERE PATI AUR BETEE NE ISE KHAREEDA HAI, MUJHE NAHIN. PHIR SE, MUJHE EKSHAN PHILMEN PASAND HAIN LEKIN MERE PATI KO GAINGASTAR AUR KOMEDEE DEKHANA BAHUT PASAND HAI. VAH HAMESHA MUJHE CHIDHAATE HAIN KI MAIN KEVAL ABHINETAON KE LIE EKSHAN PHILMEN DEKHANA CHAAHATA HOON.
Haha, is he right ?]	haaha, kyaa vaha sahee haye?]	HAAHA, KYA VAH SAHEE HAI?]
I might have to. I am more of a book person so since it's based on a book written by the main character I would be more apt to read the book.	shayed mujhe karna padegaa. main kitaabon kaa adhik shaukeen huun, isaliye choonki yeh mukhya paatr dwara likhi gaee kitab parr adharit haye, isaliye merey liye kitab padhana adhik upayukt hoga.	MUJHE KARANA PAD SAKATA HAI. MAIN EK PUSTAK VYAKTI SE ADHIK HOON, KYONKI YAH MUKHY CHARITR DVAARA LIKHEE GAEE PUSTAK PAR AADHAARIT HAI ISALIE MAIN PUSTAK KO PADHANE KE LIE ADHIK UPAYUKT HOGA.
Yeah, sometimes he is right that is why I watch the action movies lol.	haan, kabhi-kabhi vaha sahee hotaa haye isiliye main action filmein dekhta huun.	ha, kabhi vo sahi hoti hai ki mai kyo avtion moive dekhta hu
The movie is based on a book.	yeh film ack kitab parr adharit haye.	yah mmoive book me based hai
The summary of the movie seems kind of depressing. The main character doesn't seem honest and he gets arrested. I'm guessing he overall learned his lesson since he wrote a book about his life story.	film kaa saransh thodaa nirashajanak lagata haye. mukhya paatr imandar naheen lagata aur usey giraftar curr liya jaataa haye. main anuman lagaa rhaa huun kii usane kull milakar apana sabak seekh liya haye kyonki usane apani jeevan kahani key baare mein ack kitab likhi haye.	ish moive ki summary depressing hai,moive ka character imandar nahi malum parta aur vah arrest ho jata hai,muje lagta hai vah apni life se seek leta haijab vah book liogta hai
It actually sounds sad to me. Someone that has the potential to make alot of money at work and ends up getting greedy and corrupt and ruins their life.	yeh vaastav mein mujhe dukhad lagata haye. koee aisaa vyakti jisake paas kaam parr bahut saaraa paisa kamaane kii kshamata haye aur vaha lalchi aur bhrasht hoe jaataa haye aur apana jeevan barbad curr letaa haye.	muje yah accha nahi laga,jab kisi me bahut kuch kare ki abuility par lalach ke chhaker me vah bhrast ho jata aur apni life barbad kar leta haiha moive kafi entertaining
Yeah, the movie is pretty entertaining. The summary might have been written by an emo. Lol. The entire movie is fun, other than the last 10 mins or so.	haan, film kaafee manoranjak haye. hoe sakata haye kii saransh kissy emo dwara likhaa gayaa hoe. zor-zor seey hansana. aakhiri 10 minut koo chhodkar poori film majedar haye.	ha moive kafi entertaining  hai.sayad summary emo ne likhi hai,puri moive majedar hai last ke das min ke siva
Overall he ended up fine. Has a family and everything	kull milakar vaha thheek hoe gayaa. ack parivaar aur sub kuchh haye	kulmilakar ant acha tha,uske pas parivar aur sabkuch tha
He is on TV sometimes as a guest	vaha kabhi-kabhi atithi key roop mein tv parr hotey hain	kuch samay ke liye vah t.v par guest tha
Oh well that's good. I see he went to jail for 3 years. That's not too long. I wonder if he truly regrets ruining his life or just regrets losing all the money.	oh, yeh achchha haye. maine dekhaa kii vaha 3 saal key liye jail gayaa. vaha bahut lamba naheen haye. mujhe ashcharya haye kii kyaa usey sachmuch apana jeevan barbad karane kaa pachtawa haye yaa sirf saare paise khone kaa pachtawa haye.	oh yah thik tha,vah teen saal ke liye jail gaya vah jayada time nahi hota achyar use sach me dukh hua apni jingi ka ya keval paise barbad hone ka
He made that money quick and easy, while cheating the stock market.	usane share baajaar koo dhokha dete hue jaldi aur aasaani seey paisa kamaaya.	usne ashan aur quick paisa kamaya jabki usne stock market ko luta
He must be a really intelligent person, what a shame to waste all that talent.	vaha vaastav mein ack buddhiman vyakti hoga, usa saaree pratibha koo barbad karna kitni sherm kii baat haye.	vah yek intelligent vaykti tha,bari sarm hai ki sara talent barbad ho gaya
3 years was nothing.	3 saal kuchh bhee naheen thaa.	3 saal se kuch nahi
Yeah, 3 years is short.	haan, 3 saal cumm hain.	haan, 3 saal tho short hein
Well, he still is a millionaire.	khair, vaha abhee bhee karodpati hain.	well, voh ab bhi millionaire  hein
Oh wow. That I didn't know and it doesn't say. Except it says he hid $22 million in a Swiss account. Is that how he's still a millionaire?	arey vaah. yeh main naheen jaanata thaa aur yeh naheen kahata. sivaay isake kii isamen kahaa gayaa haye kii unhone swiss khaate mein 22 million dollar chhipaaye hain. kyaa isi tarah vaha abhee bhee karodpati haye?	are wow, muje is bare mein kuch nahi patha. except us 22$ million ka swiss account.. tho aise hi voh millionaire huve?
Even if he lost all the money he made previously, his movie deal, book deal and speaking fees has made him millions	bhale hii unhone pahale kamaaye gaye saare paise khou diye houn, lekin unaki movie deal, book deal aur bolane kii phees ney unhein lakhon kamaaye hain	agar voh previously saare money lost kiya tha lekin voh movie ko ache tarah deal kiya, book ko bhi,, aur kahi millions tho apne speaking fees se banaya
Do you know if he has a new family because it says his 2nd wife Naomi wanted a divorce and full custody of their children.	kyaa aap jaanate hain kii uska ack nayaa parivaar haye kyonki yeh kahata haye kii usaki doosari patni naomi talaak chaahati thee aur apane bachchon kii poori dekhrekh chaahati thee.	aapko patha hein, agar usse new family hota tho uska 2nd wife jo naomi tho jarur divorce karthi
I don't know much in detail but ,I watched him talk about his daughter once and he seemed pretty happy about where he is now.	main jyada vistaar seey tou naheen jaanata lekin, maine ack baar unhein apani betty key baare mein baat karate hue dekhaa thaa aur vaha iss baat seey kaafee khush lugg rahey they kii vaha abb kahaan hain.	muje itna detail nahi patha, mein unka daughter aur unka talk dekha hein, thoda happy nazar aa rahe the
He does say that he has made mistakes in his life.	vaha kahate hain kii unhone apane jeevan mein galatiyan kii hain.	voh kahathe hei ki yahi unka life ka mistakes hein
Oh well that's good. I do like movies (and books) based on real life stories.	oh, yeh achchha haye. mujhe vaastavik jeevan kii kahaaniyon parr adharit filmein (aur kitaaben) pasand hain.	acha sahi, muje is tarah ka movies jaise real life stories dekhna pasand hein
Try watching it , its a good one.	ise dekhane kaa prayas karein, yeh achchha haye.	mein bhi try karunga, acha hein
Looks like we did good on the chat	aisaa lagata haye kii hamane chait parr achchha kaam kiya	ham baate karme mei achche lag rahe the
I think I might have to. If it keeps my attention through the first 30 minutes I'll keep watching it. Sometimes I cheat and wikipedia movies to see what they are about before watching them.	mujhe lagata haye mujhe karna parh sakata haye. yadi yeh pahale 30 minut taka meraa dhyaan banaae rakhega tou main ise dekhta rahoonga. kabhi-kabhi main wikipedia filmein dekhane seey pahale yeh dekhane kii koshish kartaa huun kii way kiss baare mein hain.	mera khayal hai mere pass hai. yadi usne mera attention 30 min ke liye le liya to mei dhekhunga. khabhi kabhi mei movei dekhane se pahale Wikipedia mei dekhata hui
yes, I think this is a good chat.	haan, mujhe lagata haye kii yeh ack achchi baatchit haye.	haa, mere khayalhai ki ye bahut achi baate hai
Let's wrap it up	aaie ise khatm karein	chalo isko lapet lete hai

Fighting Robots	ladane vaale robot	ladai ke robots
From what I remember, this is in the future so instead of humans fighting, robots fight.	jahaan taka mujhe yaad haye, yeh bhavishya kii baat haye isaliye insanon key ladane kii bajaay robot ladenge.	mujhe jo yaad hai, yah bhavishy mein hai isalie insaanon kee ladaee ke bajaay, robot ladate hain.

It is a coming to age story and has great friendship morals	yeh puraane zamaane kii kahani haye aur isamen mitrata kii mahaan naitikta haye	Ye ek coming of age story  hai aur bahut acche friendship morals hai
Does the dragon talk?	kyaa dragon baat kartaa haye?	Kya dragon baat kar sakte hai?
one of the best scenes is when the dragon Hiccup is attacked by the bad guy Night Fury and rather than killing him, he sets him free	sabse achche drishyon mein seey ack vaha haye jaba dragon hichaki parr burey aadami night fury dwara hamla kiya jaataa haye aur usey maarne key bajaay, vaha usey aazad curr detaa haye	Best scenes me se ek hai jab dragon Hiccup ko bad guy Night fury attack aur hai aur usne maarne k bajaye jaane deta hai

Which part did Craig Ferguson give?	kregg fergueson ney kaun saa bhaag diyaa?	Craig Ferguson  ne kaun sa bhaag diya?

Were the warriors humans or dragons?	kyaa yoddha insan they yaa dragon?	yoddha manushy the ya dregan?

I'm guessing that since the movie was aimed towards children that it had a happy ending?  Yes, I like some of them..  I don't go for a lot of singing in the animated movies though.  With the exception of the Wizard of Oz, that was a great movie, I could watch it over and over.	main anuman lagaa rhaa huun kii choonki film kaa uddeshya bachchon koo dhyaan mein rakhkar banaaya gayaa thaa, isaliye iska anta sukhad thaa?  haan, mujhe unamen seey kuchh pasand hain.. haalaanki, main animated filmon mein bahut adhik gaane naheen gaataa huun.  wizard off oz koo chhodkar, vaha ack behtareen film thee, main ise baar-baar dekh sakata thaa.

It had great reception and even has 2 sequels	iska shandar swaagat huaa aur isake 2 seekwal bhee aae	Yas acchha reception tha aur usme keval 2 sequels hi the
Sounds like it.  I would probably like it.	aisaa lagata haye.  main shayed ise pasand karunga.	acchi sunai padti he. Mujhe wo acchhi lagegi.
The fight scenes do tend to get kind of violent but they are very immerssoive	ladaai key drishya kuchh hudd taka hinsak hoe jaate hain lekin way bahut hii prabhaavshaali hotey hain	Fight scenes thode violent hai lekin woimmerssoive hai

Allie volunteers in a hospital for wounded soldiers, where she meets officer Lon Hammond Jr., a young lawyer who comes from old Southern money.

I like Astrid and Gobber	mujhe astrid aur gobar pasand hain	Mujhe Astrid aur Gobber pasand aaye.
Toothless is my favorite dragon	toothless meraa pasandida dragon haye	Toothless mera favorite dragon hai
Toothless is a great character. Hiccup was supposed to kill him in the beginning but couldn't bring himself to do it and instead sets him free	toothless ack mahaan charitra haye. shuruat mein hichaki koo usey maarnaa thaa, lekin vaha khud aisaa naheen curr sakaa aur isake bajaay usey aazad curr diyaa	Toothless ek great character hai. Hiccup asal me use maarne wala tha but mar nahi paya aur use free kar diya
He gradually tames the dragon and calls him toothless because of his retractable teech	vaha dheere-dheere ajgar koo vash mein curr letaa haye aur usake peechhe hatane vaale danton key kaaran usey dantaheen kahata haye	Wo gradually dragon ko tame karta hai aur use toothless bulata hai kyuki uske retractable teeth hai
It was becuase of toothless that Hiccup learned how to tame other dragons	toothless honey key kaaran hii hichaki ney dusare dragon koo vash mein karna seekha	Toothless ki wajah se Hiccup baki dragons ko bhi tame karna seekh gaya
Do you think Hiccup cheats because of what he learns from Toothless ? (by using it his training class?)	kyaa aapako lagata haye kii hichaki toothless seey joe kuchh seekhati haye usake kaaran dhokha detee haye? (ise apane prashikshan varg kaa upayog karke?)	Kya tumhe lagta hai hiccup cheat karta jo bhi toothless se seekha? ( apni training class me wo chez use karke?)
He become proficient in subduing the captive dragons, i don't know how much you can call that cheating	vaha bandee dragon koo vash mein karane mein kushal hoe gayaa, mujhe naheen pataa kii aap ise kitna dhokha kaha sakate hain	wo captive dragons ko vas karne me kushal ho gaya, uko aap cheating kaise keh sakte hai?
But he wouldn't have known that without having Toothless.	lekin toothless key binaa usey yeh pataa naheen chala paataa.	Lekin wo ye Toothless ke bina nahi jan pata.
so maybe just an advantage not cheating	tou shayed sirf ack fayda haye, dhokha naheen	to sayad wo advantage ho cheating nahi
How do you feel about how Stoick treats Hiccup?	aap kaisa mahsoos karate hain kii stoic hichaki key saath kaisa vyavhaar kartaa haye?	Aapko kya lag raha he ki stoick Hiccup ke sath kya kar raha hai?
Stoick leaving Hiccup, but then arriving home unscucessful and finding how Hiccup had trained the dragons led to a celebration	stoic ney hichaki koo chhod diyaa, lekin phir ghar pahunchane mein asafal rhaa aur paaya kii hichaki ney dragon koo kaise prashikshit kiya thaa, jisase jashn manaaya gayaa	stoick Hiccup ko chhod raha hai, lekin phir ghar mein becheni se pahuncha aur paaya ki Hiccup ne dragons ko kis tarah prashikshit kiya tha
i mean throughout the whole movie. he was rather harsh to him in the beginning	meraa matlab haye poori film mein. shuruat mein vaha usake prati kaafee kathor they	Mera matalab hai puri movie ke dauran. vah suruat mein usake prati kathor nahin tha
Stoick uses Hiccup when Hiccups accidently reveals that Toothless can locate the dragon's nest. Stoick disowns his son	stoic hichaki kaa upayog kartaa haye jaba hichaki koo galati seey pataa chalata haye kii toothless dragon key ghonsale kaa pataa lagaa sakata haye. stoic ney apane bete koo aswikar curr diyaa	Stoick Hiccup ka upayog karata hai jab Hiccups ko akasmik rup se pata chalata hai ki Toothless Dragon ke ghosle ka pata laga sakata hai. Stoick ne apane bete ko nanga kar diya
That to me is very harsh	merey liye yeh bahut kathor haye	Mere liye yah bahut harsh hai
However, when Hiccup almost drowns trying to free toothless, Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son	haalaanki, jaba hichaki toothless koo chhudaane kii koshish mein lagbhag doob jaati haye, tou stoic apane bete key saath sulah karke una donon koo bachaata haye.	halaki, jab Hiccup lagabhag toothless ko chhudane ki koshish mein doob jata hai, to stoick apane bete ke saath un dono ko bacha leta hai
Did you like the ending? how they make Hiccup and Toothless basically equal? (both missing something vital?)	kyaa aapako anta pasand aayaa? way hichaki aur toothless koo mool roop seey samaan kaise banaate hain? (donon koo kuchh mahatvapurna yaad aaa rhaa haye?)	kya aapako ending pasand aaya? ve Hiccup aur Toothless ko mul rup se samaan kaise banate hain? (donon me kuchh vital yaad aa rahee hai?)
How do you feel about the rotten tomatoes 98% score?	sadey hue tamataron key 98% score key baare mein aap kaisa mahsoos karate hain?	kya rotten tomatoes ka score 98% sahi hei kya?
Yes, when Hiccup wakes up on Berk, his lower left leg is missing and he is using a prothesis, so he and toothless are the same	haan, jaba hichaki berk parr jaagati haye, tou uska nichala baayaan pair gayab haye aur vaha prothesis kaa upayog curr rhaa haye, isaliye vaha aur toothless ack hii hain	haan, jab Hiccup, Berk ke paas wakeup kiya tho uska Lower left leg miss hota aur usse prothesis ho jatha, tho uska daad bhi nahi rehatha.
I thought a 98% was a good score on rotton tomatoes	maine socha kii sadey hue tamataron parr 98% ack achchha score haye	mein tho 98% laga, aur uska score tho kaafi ache hein rotten tomatoes ka
Hey	arey	Hey

Pretty good. Are you a Marvel fan?	bahut achchha. kyaa aap marval key prashansak hain?	Kaafi accha. Kya tum Marvel fan ho?
Good to hear. Sure, what about you?	sunane mein achchha. zaroor, aapke baare mein kyaa?	Sunke accha laga. Sure, tum batao.
Yes, I am a huge Marvel fan. One of my favorites is the Avengers. Mark Ruffalo is great as The Hulk.	haan, main marval kaa bahut badaa prashansak huun. merey pasandida mein seey ack avengers haye. dha hulk key roop mein maark rafaalo mahaan hain.	Haan, main bahut bada Marvel fan hu. Avengers meri favorites me se hai. Mark Ruffallo bahut badhiya Hulk hai.
Sure, I liked the Avengers a lot.	zaroor, mujhe avengers bahut pasand aaee.	Sure, Mujhe avengers bahut pasand aayi
I also think Ruffalo is a great Hulk.	main bhee sochata huun kii rafalo ack mahaan hulk haye.	Mujhe bhi lagta hai Ruffalo badhiya hulk hai.
Is Avengers the movie we’re supposed to talk about?	kyaa avengers vaha film haye jisake baare mein hamein baat karni chaahiye?	Kya Avengers wo movie hai jiske baare me ham baat karne wale hai?
Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 92% rating and average of 8/10. Yes, I believe so.	rotten tomatose ney ise 92% rating aur ausat 8/10 diyaa. haan, meraa aisaa maanana ​​haye.	Rotten Tomatoes ne use 92% rating aur average 8/10 ka. Haan, yahi lagta hai
Okay then. Right, I’ve always experiened that IMDB gives movies a lower average rating than rotten tomatoes.	achchha taba. thheek haye, maine hamesha anubhav kiya haye kii imdb filmon koo sadey hue tamataron kii tulana mein cumm ausat rating detaa haye.	Okay phir. Mujhe yahi experience hua hai k IMDB Rotten Tomatoes se lower average rating deti hai
Tha	thaa	Tha
That's true	yeh sach haye	Haan sach hai
But I guess 92 and 80 are a fair assesment.	lekin mujhe lagata haye kii 92 aur 80 ack uchit mulyankan haye.	Lekin I guess 92 aur 80 fair assessment hai
Yeah, I think Joss Whedon was a good choice for director also. His vision was really inline with the comics.	haan, mujhe lagata haye kii joss wheadon nirdeshak key liye bhee ack achchha vikalp they. unaka drishtikon vaastav mein comics key anuroop thaa.	Haan, Mujhe lagta hai Joss Whedon director k liye acchi choice tha. Uski vision comics se milti hai
Well, I can’t speak for the comics (haven’t read them), but this movie is a great mashup of all the heroes and their stories.	khair, main comics key baare mein kuchh naheen kaha sakata (maine unhein padhaa naheen haye), lekin yeh film sabhi nayakon aur unaki kahaaniyon kaa ack behtareen mishran haye.	Well, main comics k baare me to nahi keh sakta ( nahi padha hu) but ye movie sabhi heroes aur unke stories ka badhiya mashup hai
I guess it’s just a very good movie with an amazing plot.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh adbhut kathaanak vaali ack bahut achchi film haye.	I guess ye ek acchi movie thi ek amazing plot k saath.
I agree.	main sahmat huun.	Main agree karta hu
Loki using Clint Barton to help him with the Tesseract was awesome too. I like him even though he's a bad guy	loki dwara tesseract mein madad key liye clint barton kaa upayog karna bhee adbhut thaa. bhale hii vaha ack buraa aadami haye, phir bhee main usey pasand kartaa huun	Taissairacht ke saath unakee madad karane ke lie loki ne klint baartan ka upayog kiya jo bahut hee bhayaanak tha. main use pasand karata hoon, bhale hee vah ek bura aadamee ho
Right, that was a great scene.	sahee haye, vaha bahut badhiya drishya thaa.	Sahee, vah ek behatareen drshy tha.
Loki’s a likable villain I’d say.	main kahoonga kii loki ack aakarshak khalnayak haye.	Loki ke ek yogy khalanaayak hai jo main kahata hoon
It was interesting how it caused such a riff within The Avengers. Thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie.	yeh dilchasp thaa kii isane avengers key bheetar iss tarah kii daraar kaise paida kii. thore koo abb bhee aisaa mahsoos hoe rhaa thaa kii film key dauran lambe samay taka usake prati usaki wafadari rahee.	Yah dilachasp tha ki avengers ke bheetar is tarah kee daraar kaise huee. thor ko ab bhee aisa lag raha tha ki philm ke dauraan unhonne lambe samay tak unake prati vaphaadaaree kee hai.
You think?	aapako lagata haye?	aapako lagata hai?
I thought he was pretty ruthless with him.	mujhe lagaa kii vaha usake prati bahut nirdayi thaa.	Mainne socha ki vah usake saath bahut kroor tha.
That’s just my opinion obviously.	jahir taur parr yeh sirf merrie raay haye.	Yah sirph meree raay hai.
I can see that somewhat but he could have done a lot more damage if he wanted to.	main ise kuchh hudd taka dekh sakata huun lekin aggar vaha chaahata tou bahut adhik nuksan curr sakata thaa.	Main dekh sakata hoon ki kuchh had tak agar vah chaahata to bahut adhik nukasaan kar sakata tha.
Do you have a specific example on mind?	kyaa aapke munn mein koee vishisht udaaharan haye?	Kya aapake paas man par ek vishisht udaaharan hai?
The end fight scene definitely was. He could have killed him.	antim ladaai kaa drishya nishchit roop seey thaa. vaha usey maar sakata thaa.	Antim phait seen jaroor tha. vah use maar sakata tha.
Oh, the one where Hulk ends up hitting him?	oh, vahee jahaan hulk antatah usey maartaa haye?	oh, wo jab hulk use maar raha tha?
Yeah, that was classic. One of the funniest moments of the movie. I also liked when Iron Man fell back through the wormhole. It had everyone on edge I think.	haan, vaha classic thaa. film key sabse majedar palon mein seey ack. mujhe yeh bhee achchha lagaa jaba iron maine wormhole seey vaapas gir gayaa. mujhe lagata haye kii isase harr koee utsaahit thaa.	haan, yah classic tha. Movie ke sabase funniest moments mein se ek. Mujhe wo bhee pasand aaya jab Iron Man wormhole ke maadhyam se vaapas gir gaya. Mujhe lagata hai ki yah har kisee ko yeh edge pe le aaya tha.
Absolutely. Epic scenes.	bilkul. mahakavya drishya.	Sahi main. Pura epic scenes tha.
Can we talk about other movies or just this one?	kyaa humm anya filmon yaa sirf isi film key baare mein baat curr sakate hain?	kya ham koi bhi Movie ya sirph isi ke baare mein baat kar sakate hain ?
You know, MCU	tumhen pataa haye, mcu	aap jaanate hongain , MCU
I also like the way Nick Fury stood his ground with the Council. Just this one.	jiss tarah seey nick fury ney council key saath apana paksh rakhaa, vaha bhee mujhe pasand aayaa. buss yahee vaalaa.	mujhe yah bhee pasand hai ki jis tarah se Nick Fury ne Council ke saamne apana argument ko support karta raha. sirph yah ek.
Understood.	samajha.	samajhe understood.
Yeah, Fury’s great too.	haan, fury bhee badhiya haye.	haan, Fury’s bhee great hai
So, any final thoughts?	tou, koee antim vichaar?	to, koee bhee final thought.
It's crazy that the Council wanted him to drop a nuclear missile into New York.	yeh ajib baat haye kii parishad chaahati thee kii vaha newyork mein paramanu missile giraaye.	yah paagalpan hai ki Council chaahata tha ki vah nuclear missile New York mein girae
Great examples, man.	mahaan udaaharan, yaar.	badhiya examples, man.
It was great talking to another MCU fan.	ack anya mcu prashansak seey baat karke bahut achchha lagaa.	ek aur MCU fan se bath karke accha laga.

Seems he had some good luck with some good people that helped him get into school and football.	aisaa lagata haye kii kuchh achche logon key saath usaki kismat achchi thee, jisase usey school aur football mein jaane mein madad millie.	haan yar kuch goodluck hota tho kaafi ache logon ke saath mil jaatha aur voh school jaatha aur voh football bhi kheltha
I agree. The two individuals that adopted him changed his life forever	main sahmat huun. jinn dou vyaktiyon ney unhein god liya, unhone unaka jeevan hamesha key liye badal diyaa	mein maantha hoon. do individuals agar usse adopt nahi karthe tho uska life tho hamesha ke liye change hota/
Definitely, it also shows what kind of person he is by him withholding his strength at first	nishchit roop seey, isase yeh bhee pataa chalata haye kii vaha kiss prakaar kaa vyakti haye, jaba vaha pahale apani taakat koo roque letaa haye	definitely, isse patha chaltha ki voh kaise tarah ka log hein jo uska strength pehla dekhayi detha
It is a shame that Leigh Anne's friends did not approve of what she was doing.	yeh sherm kii baat haye kii leh ainee joe curr rahee thee, vaha usake doston koo manjur naheen thaa.	badi shame hey yar, jo leigh anne ka friends nei approve nahi kiya
Yeah it's sad how people judge just because they don't understand the situation.	haan, yeh dukhad haye kii loga kaise nirnay lete hain kyonki way sthiti koo naheen samajhate hain.	haan, kaise logon judge karte unka situation bhi nahi jaante
Though thank goodness Leigh Anne is strong willed	haalaanki bhagwan kaa shukra haye kii leey ainee dridh ichchaashakti vaali haye	acha huva uska goodness leigh anne nei strongly willed hein
Yep, they pass judgement too soon and without all of the information	haan, way bahut jald aur binaa poori jaankaari key nirnay sunaa dete hain	haan, aise hi judgement de dethe kuch information ke bina
Yes, she is definitely strong.	haan, vaha nishchit roop seey majboot haye.	haan, voh definitely strong hein
It's crazy how he was approached by gang members when he went to go see his biological mother.	yeh ajib baat haye kii jaba vaha apani javic maan seey milane gayaa tou giroh key sadasyon ney usase kaise sampark kiya.	yeh tho crazy hein yar, jab voh apni biological mother ke paas approach kar rahe thi
It's good that he chose the right path though	haalaanki yeh achchha haye kii usane sahee raasta chunaa	acha tho voh yeh right path chose kiya hoga
That must have been a scary situation for him.	vaha usake liye ack daravani sthiti rahee hogi.	haan voh tho scary situation tha uskeliye
True, but it made him stronger of a person. It also most likely made him realize he didn't belong with the criminals especially after they were making sexual comments about the same person who was taking care of him	sach haye, lekin isane unhein ack insan key roop mein majboot banaaya. isase sambhavatah usey yeh ehsas huaa kii vaha apraadhiyon key saath naheen haye, khaskar taba jaba way usee vyakti key baare mein yaun tippaniyaan curr rahey they joe usaki dekhbhal curr rhaa thaa.	sach, isliye usse stronger ban saktha. usko realize bhi nahi huva ki voh yek criminals ke belong nahi hey aur jab koi sexual comments kare ise person ke baare mein  jo itna care karte
That is what probably made him decide that life was not for him. When someone talks that way about someone you love you know they are not your true friend.	shayed isi baat ney usey yeh nirnay lene parr majboor curr diyaa kii jeevan usake liye naheen haye. jaba koee aapke priya vyakti key baare mein iss tarah baat kartaa haye tou aap samajh jaate hain kii vaha aapka sachcha dost naheen haye.	ISSE KARAN US NE SOCH LIYA KI ZINDAHGI USKE LIYE NAHIN HAIN. AGAR KOI AISI BAAT KISI KE BARE ME JISE TUM PYAAR KARTHE HO  TO TUM MALUM HAIN KI YEH THMHARE SACHHA DOST NAHIN HAI

Yeah same here, looks like Rotten Tom atoes and Metacritic didn't score the movie very well...	haan, yahaan bhee vaisa hii haye, aisaa lagata haye kii rotten tomatose aur metacritic ney film koo bahut achchha score naheen diyaa...	Han mujhe bhi, Rotten Tomatoes aur Metacritic ki tarah lag rha hai movie to achhe se score nhi kiya...

Yahan nhi bataya gya wo G-d hai ya nhi.
Same here, never heard of the side characters. I have no idea who Philip Baker Hall is. He isn't sharing any simiar character last name so I'm guessing he might play a friend	yahaan bhee vaisa hii haye, side kirdaaron key baare mein kabhi naheen sunaa. mujhe naheen pataa kii phillip becker holl kaun haye. vaha charitra seey milata-julata koee antim naam saajha naheen curr rhaa haye, isaliye main anuman lagaa rhaa huun kii vaha ack dost kii bhoomika nibha sakata haye	yaah bhi, mein side characters ke baare mein kuch suna nahi. muje philip baker hall ka koi idea nahi. voh simiar character share kar raha hein uska last name tho uska friend neh play kiya hein

I have no idea what that word means, but I'm assuming they are trying to say the movie lacked in substance or Carrey's acting ability? It seems the second review doesn't think Jim is a real actor "...Carrey probably nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor" Both reviews don't seem to like his acting skills....	mujhe naheen pataa kii usa shabd kaa kyaa matlab haye, lekin main maan rhaa huun kii way yeh kahane kii koshish curr rahey hain kii film mein saar yaa carrie kii abhinay kshamata kii kamee haye? aisaa lagata haye kii doosari sameeksha yeh naheen maanati kii zim ack vaastavik abhineta haye "...carrie ney shayed ack dinn vaastavik abhineta banane kii aasha paale hue they" donon sameekshaaen unake abhinay kaushal koo pasand naheen karatin....	muje kuch idea nahi hein, lekin carrey ka acting is movie me tho lacked hein. second reviews bhi itna acha nahi jo jim ne kiya voh ache actor hein.. carrey tho probably ache nursed hein dono ache actor future mein ban jaayenge. dono ka review kaafi ache skills hein
I'd still see it given the cast. Never heard of the director though	kalakaron koo dekhate hue main abhee bhee ise dekhunga. haalaanki nirdeshak key baare mein kabhi naheen sunaa	mein is director ke baare mein kuch suna nahi hein

What did you like about Bruce Almighty?	maine liar liar kaa sabse adhik anand liya. halanki unake paas kaee achchi filmein hain. aapako broose olmitee key baare mein kyaa pasand aayaa?	Mujhe Liar Liar sabse jyada pasand aayi. Uski waise to bahut acchi movies hai. Bruce Almighty kaise lagi?
I enjoyed that Bruce Almighty was a comedy because I enjoy a good laugh. I also liked how the movie introduced God, which not many movies do. What did you like most about Bruce Almighty?	mujhe majaa aayaa kii broose olmitee ack comedy thee kyonki main achchi hansi kaa anand letaa huun. mujhe yeh bhee pasand aayaa kii kaise film ney bhagwan kaa parichay diyaa, joe kaee filmein naheen karatin. aapako broose olmitee key baare mein sabse adhik kyaa pasand aayaa?

Yes I liked the role of Morgan Freeman as "God" also. I also like the setting of the movie which is memorable to me because Im from Buffalo.	haan, mujhe morgan freeman kii "godd" kii bhoomika bhee pasand aaee. mujhe film kii setting bhee pasand haye joe merey liye yadgar haye kyonki main buffelo seey huun.	Han mujhe "God" ke role mein Morgan Freeman ka character bahut pasand aaya. Mujhe film ki setting bhi pasand hai jo mere liye yaadgaar hai kyunki Im buffalo se.
I think it was rated pretty low. What score would you have given it?	mujhe lagata haye kii ise kaafee cumm rating dee gaee thee. aapane ise kyaa ank diyaa hoga?	Mujhe lagta hai iski rating bahut low hui hai. Kya score diya hai tumne ise?
Oh that is interesting! Morgan Freeman is another great actor. His voice can be used in many settings and roles.	oh, yeh dilchasp haye! morgan freeman ack aur mahaan abhineta hain. unaki aavaaz kaa upayog kaee settings aur bhoomikaon mein kiya jaa sakata haye.	Oh yeh to intresting hai! Morgan Freeman bhi ek or achha actor hai. Uski awaaz bahut si settings and roles mein use ki jaa skti hai.
I think that it should have been rated higher. It seems like rotten tomatoes always gives low ratings though.	mujhe lagata haye kii ise oonchi rating dee jaani chaahiye thee. haalaanki aisaa lagata haye kii sadey hue tamatar hamesha cumm rating dete hain.	Mujhe lagta hai ki iski rating zyada honi chahiye thi. Haanlanki rotten tomatoes hamesha kam rating deta hai.
Wasn't there a sequel to this movie?	kyaa iss film kaa seekwal naheen thaa?	Kya iss movie ka koi sequel hai?
Do you feel like this movie was a breakout movie for Jim Carrey?	kyaa aapako aisaa lagata haye kii yeh film zim carrie key liye ack breakout film thee?	Kya tumhe lagta hai ki yeh movie Jim Carrey ke liye breakout tha?

I think that he has a lot of recognition for being in this movie. But I am not sure of other movies he was in before this one.	mujhe lagata haye kii iss film mein honey key kaaran unhein kaafee pehchaan millie haye.' lekin main iss film seey pahale unaki anya filmon key baare mein nishchit naheen huun.	Mujhe lagta hai iss movie mein bane rehne ke liye uske bahut pehnchaan hai. But main sure nhi huin ki isse pehle dusri movies kaisa tha.
I think Ace Ventura and the Mask may have come out before this. Not sure	mujhe lagata haye kii aisa ventura aur mask isase pahale saamane aaa chuke honge. nishchit naheen	Mujhe lagta hai ki isse pehle Ace Ventura and the Mask bahar aa gye honge. Sure nhi huin
I also enjoyed him in the Grinch movie. He is able to perform many different roles across many genres of movies.	maine grinch film mein bhee unaka anand liya. vaha kaee shailiyon kii filmon mein kaee alag-alag bhoomikaaen nibhaane mein saksham hain.	muje grinch movie pasand hein. voh kaafi role mein perform karthe
Has he played any serious movie roles like a drama?	kyaa unhone naatak jaisi koee gambhir filmi bhoomika nibhai haye?	kya kuch serious movie yaani drama me bhi play keye hein kya?
I am not sure about that. He seems to be more of a comedian type actor.	humm usake liye aashvast naheen hain. vaha ack comedian type actor jyada lagate hain.	muje patha nahi hein. lekin voh comedian type ka actor hein
Do you know any other movies by this director?	kyaa aap iss nirdeshak kii koee anya film jaanate hain?	kya aap ko is director ka aur koi movies patha hein?
If you were in a similar situation as Bruce (like in the key scene mentioned), would you feel frustrated as well?	yadi aap broose jaisi hii sthiti mein hotey (jaisa kii ullekhit mukhya drishya mein haye), tou kyaa aap bhee nirash mahsoos karenge?	tho Bruce yaani keyscene ke tarah lag raha hein. kya aapko thoda frustrated feel hota hein
I have not heard of any other movies by this director.	maine iss nirdeshak kii kissy anya film key baare mein naheen sunaa haye.	mein is director ke baare mein kuch nahi suna hein
Yes I think his frustrations are very relatable in many aspects of life	haan, mujhe lagata haye kii jeevan key kaee pahaluon mein usaki niraashaaen bahut praasangik hain	haan. thoda frustrations hoon lekin is life mein kuch aspects relate bhi kar saktha
I agree. I would feel the same way if I were constantly experiencing bad luck	main sahmat huun. yadi main lagaatar durbhagya kaa anubhav curr rhaa hotaa tou mujhe bhee aisaa hii mahsoos hotaa	mein maantha hoon. muje bhi kuch aise hi feel huva, sabhi is bad luck ko experiencing karthe hein
Would you want to play "God" for a week? What would you do?	kyaa aap ack saptah key liye "bhagwan" kii bhoomika nibhana chaahenge? aap kyaa karenge?	kya is week ko God movie play dekhna pasand karenge? ya aur kuch?
I probably wouldn't, only because that would be a lot of responsibility to take care of everything in the entire world. But I would like to eliminate suffering in people. What about you?	main shayed aisaa naheen karunga, sirf isaliye kyonki poori duniya mein harr cheej kaa khyaal rakhna bahut badee jimmedaari hogi. lekin main logon kii peedaa koo khatm karna chahunga. aap kaise hain?	nahi yar, kyon ki muje aur koi kaam hein, kyon ki kaafi logon isse suffer hote hein. aapka kya haal chaal hein?
Same here. I would probably end up like Bruce and end up saying yes to everyones prayers since it would be so overwhelming	yahaan bhee aisaa hii. main sambhavatah broose kii tarah samaapt hoe jaaoonga aur sabhi kii prarthanaon key liye haan kahoonga kyonki yeh bahut jabardast hoga	muje bhi.. mein tho bruce ke saath end up karunga kyon ki voh sabhi prayers ko suntha aur sabhi overwhelming ho jaathe
Do you think that was the best way for him to answer prayers through email?	kyaa aapako lagata haye kii email key madhyam seey prarthanaon kaa uttar dene kaa yeh sabse achchha tarika thaa?	kya is tarah ka prayers aap maanthe hon, jaise email mein prayer send karna?
I agree. I think the email system was less personal than how God would actually answer prayers in reality. However, at that point I'm sure he was overwhelmed. How would you answer everyone's prayers if you had to be God?	main sahmat huun. mujhe lagata haye kii ishwar vaastav mein prarthanaon kaa uttar kaise dega isaki tulana mein email pranali cumm vyaktigat thee. haalaanki, usa samay mujhe yakeen haye kii vaha abhibhoot thaa. yadi aapako bhagwan banana hoe tou aap sabhi kii prarthanaon kaa uttar kaise denge?	haan,... ab sabhi update hogaye tho kyon God bhi apne email system se kyon nahi chaleye... however, voh tho badi overwhelmed they.. kya voh saari prayers sunthe, jaise God ke tarah?
Maybe through some type of app which is more modern now.  Do you think Bruce and Grace made a good couple?	shayed kissy prakaar key aip key madhyam seey joe abb adhik aadhunik haye.  kyaa aapako lagata haye kii broose aur grace ack achchi jodee hain?	hosaktha, ab sabhi mordern tho hein... kuch app bhi ho saktha.. kya bruce aur grace vaakahi mein ache couple the?
I think that the fact that they came back together and reconciled proves that they were always meant to be together.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh tathya kii way ack saath vaapas aae aur mell-milaap kiya, yeh saabit kartaa haye kii way hamesha ack saath rahane key liye baney they.	haan voh dono apne aapas ka pyar ko proves karthey they..
What do you think he learned the most about being God for the week?	aapako kyaa lagata haye kii usa saptah usane bhagwan honey key baare mein sabse adhik kyaa seekha?	aapko kya lagtha hein ki voh God se kya sikha hoga ?
I think he learned about true happiness and how much people need prayers and responses by God. I think that he now understands that importance of not complaining.	mujhe lagata haye kii usane sachchi khushi key baare mein seekha aur logon koo ishwar kii prarthanaon aur pratikriyaon kii kitni aavashyakta haye. mujhe lagata haye kii vaha abb shikayat naa karane key mahatva koo samajhata haye.	muje lagtha hein ki, voh true happiness kya  hota aur kaise peoples prayer karthe aur god kaise respond karteh.. ab usses sab understand hoga ..
Jaws was such a good movie!	jozz bahut achchi film thee!	Jaws kya good movie thi!
I agree. It was well made.	main sahmat huun. yeh achchi tarah seey banaaya gayaa thaa.	me agree karta hu. yah well made thi.
The scares were well timed.	daraane kaa samay thheek thaa.	scares well timed the
I liked the soundtrack.	mujhe soundtrack pasand aayaa.	mene soundtrack like kiya
What was your favorite part?	aapka pasandida hissa kyaa thaa?	tumhara favorite part kon sa tha?
I think it was utilizing a location like Amity Island. It made me feel as if the plot could happen anywhere.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh emity dweep jaise sthaan kaa upayog curr rhaa thaa. isase mujhe aisaa mahsoos huaa maano yeh sajish kaheen bhee hoe sakati haye.	mujhe lagta he yah Amity Island jaisa location use kar raha he.mujhe aisa lagata he jaise plot kahi bhi ho sakta he.
Was the soundtrack your favorite part?	kyaa soundtrack aapka pasandida hissa thaa?	kya soundtrack tumhara favorite part tha?
That makes sense. Yes, especially the part that it is so famous for. The sound they played whenever they wanted to increase the audience's fear and anxiety.	yeh samajh aataa haye. haan, visheshkar vaha bhaag jisake liye yeh itna prasiddh haye. jaba bhee way chaahte they, way joe dhwani bajaate they, vaha darshakon key bhay aur chinta koo badhaa detee thee.	isme sense he. ha, especially voh part jiske liye ye itna famous he.jab bhi ve audience ki fear aur anxiety badana chahte the unhone ye sound play kiya.
Just another affirmation that Spielberg knew what he was doing even in post-production.	buss ack aur pushti kii spielberg koo pataa thaa kii vaha post-production mein bhee kyaa curr rahey they.	ek dusra affirmation ki Spielberg knew ki voh post-production me kya kar raha tha.
Do you usually like this type of movie?	kyaa aap aamtaur parr iss prakaar kii film pasand karate hain?	kya aap aamataur par is tarah kee philm pasand karate hain?
No doubt. He is very good at making movies. No, it is not my favorite kind. I am not much into jump scares. I like documentaries. How about you?	isamen koee shaka naheen. vaha filmein banaane mein bahut achche hain. naheen, yeh merrie pasandida kism naheen haye. main koodane key darr mein jyada dilchaspi naheen rakhta. mujhe vrittachitra pasand hain. aap kaise hain?	isamen koee shak nahin, vah philmen banaane mein bahut achchhe hain. nahin, yah meree pasandeeda kism nahin hai. main bahut jyaada dara hua nahin hoon. mujhe vrttachitr pasand hain. aap kaise hain?
I like this type of movie around Halloween; otherwise, I enjoy action films.	mujhe helovin key aspas iss prakaar kii film pasand haye; anyatha, mujhe action filmein pasand hain.	mujhe hailoveen ke aasapaas is tarah kee philm pasand hai; anyatha, mujhe ekshan philmon ka aanand milata hai
That is understandable. Halloween is a good time to scare yourself.	yeh samajh mein aataa haye. helovin khud koo daraane kaa ack achchha samay haye.	yah samajh mein aata hai.hailoveen khud ko daraane ka ek achchha samay hai.
What did you think of the mayor's reaction to the shark attack?	aapane shark key hamale parr meyer kii pratikriya key baare mein kyaa socha?	shaark ke hamale par meyar kee pratikriya ke baare mein aapane kya socha?
I think it was greedy. I agree it is best not to panic the public, but putting people in danger out of greed is not okay.	mujhe lagata haye yeh lalchi thaa. main maanata huun kii janata koo ghabrana naheen chaahiye, lekin lalach key kaaran logon koo khatare mein dalna thheek naheen haye.	mujhe lagata hai ki yah laalachee tha.main maanata hoon ki janata ko ghabaraana nahin chaahie, lekin laalach se logon ko khatare mein daalana theek nahin hai.
Exactly, I thought it was neat to think of real world implications both fiscally and morally.	bilkul, maine socha kii vittiya aur naitik roop seey vaastavik duniya key nihitarthon key baare mein sochana achchha hoga.	theek, mainne socha tha ki vaastavik duniya ke nihitaarth ko naitik aur naitik roop se donon ke baare mein sochana saaph tha.
Of how to present this to the public.	ise janata key saamane kaise prastut kiya jaae.	ise janata ke saamane kaise pesh kiya jae.
Which in the end resulted in a shark-hunting frenzy	jisake parinamswarup antatah shark-shikaar kaa unmaad paida huaa	jisake parinaamasvaroop ant mein ek shaark-shikaar unmaad paida hua
I like to think of those things too. I did not like that part. I think I would have liked it better if the shark was led out to sea, but most people would probably not enjoy a movie like that, not enough drama.	mujhe bhee una cheezon key baare mein sochana pasand haye. mujhe vaha hissa pasand naheen aayaa. mujhe lagata haye kii aggar shark koo samudra seey baahar leey jaaya jaataa tou mujhe yeh behtar lagata, lekin jyadatar loga shayed usa tarah kii film kaa anand naheen lenge, naa hii paryaapt naatak kaa.	un cheejon ke baare mein bhee sochana pasand karate hain.mujhe vah hissa pasand nahin tha.mujhe lagata hai ki shaark ko samudr tak le jaaya jaata to mujhe achchha lagata, lekin jyaadaatar log shaayad us tarah kee philm ka aanand nahin lenge, paryaapt naatak nahin
You are right on that.	aap iss parr sahee hain.	aap us par sahee hain.
It was nice to see characters such as Brody step up - though it took his son to go into shock in order to spur him to action.	broady jaise kirdaaron koo aage badhate dekhana achchha lagaa - halanki unake bete koo kaarravaai key liye prerit karane key liye sadame mein jaanaa padaa.	brodee ke kadam jaise charitron ko dekhana achchha tha - haalaanki isane unake bete ko kaarravaee ke lie prerit karane ke lie sadame mein le liya.
I think Spielberg hit the nail on the head as far as portraying small town politics.	mujhe lagata haye kii chhote shaharon kii rajneeti koo chitrit karane key mamle mein spielberg ney bilkul sahee kadam uthaaya haye.	mujhe lagata hai ki speelabarg ne chhote shahar kee raajaneeti ko chitrit karane ke lie naakhoon par sir maara.
Yes. It was realistic, though I think much of it applies to politics of all types.	haan. yeh yathaarthvaadi thaa, haalaanki mujhe lagata haye kii isamen seey adhikansh sabhi prakaar kii rajneeti parr lagu hotaa haye.	haan. yah yathaarthavaadee tha, haalaanki mujhe lagata hai ki yah sabhee prakaar kee raajaneeti par laagoo hota hai.
Money seems to always be highest priority.	aisaa lagata haye kii paisa hamesha sarvocch prathamikta haye.	paisa hamesha sarvochch praathamikata lagata hai.
Unfortunately, true.	durbhagyavash yeh sach haye.	durbhaagyavash yah sach hai.
And sadly we do not get galvanized to action sometimes until tragedy strikes.	aur dukh kii baat haye kii humm kabhi-kabhi taba taka kaarravaai key liye taiyar naheen hotey jaba taka koee trasdi naa aaa jaae.	aur dukh kee baat yah hai ki hamen traasadee ke hamalon tak kabhee-kabhee kaarravaee ke lie jastee nahin milata hai.
Have you seen other Spielberg movies?	kyaa aapane spielberg kii anya filmein dekhi hain?	kya aapane any speelabarg philmen dekhee hain?
Yes, he has his shining moments and some duds along the way. I feel that more of his movies fall into the former rather than latter category.	haan, usake jeevan mein kuchh ujjwal kshan aur kuchh kathinaaiyaan hain. mujhe lagata haye kii unaki adhikatar filmein baad kii shreni key bajaay poorv shreni mein aatee hain.	haan, usake paas apane chamakadaar kshan aur raaste mein kuchh yugal hain. mujhe lagata hai ki unakee adhik philmen baad kee shrenee ke bajaay poorv mein aatee hain.
You?	aap?	aap?
I know I have and that his movies are usually really well made, but I cannot remember which movies are his. I am very bad at stuff like that.	main jaanata huun kii unaki filmein aam taur parr bahut achchi banati hain, lekin mujhe yaad naheen haye kii unaki kaun see filmein hain. main iss tarah kii cheejon mein bahut buraa huun.	hey muje toh unka  movies bahut pasand hein lakin unka movies muje yaad nahi aatha hein. mein yaad karne me thoda kamjor hoon
I did not like the scuba part. I enjoy enjoy breathing .	mujhe scuba vaalaa bhaag pasand naheen aayaa. mujhe saans lene mein anand aataa haye.	muje toh voh scuba part bilkul pasand nahi hein, magar voh breathing toh mein enjoy kar raha tha
I usually am as well.	main bhee aamtaur parr aisaa hii huun.	mein tho aise hi hoon
Sorry, for the typo.	typo key liye kshama karein.	maaf kar na us typo ko
No worries. Completely agree on breathing/ I would not be getting in the water even with a cage.	koee chinta naheen. saans lene parr poori tarah sahmat huun/ main pinjare key saath bhee paani mein naheen utarunga.	jaane de yar, mein toh us breathing ko completely agree karunga, aur mein kabhi bhi us cage mein pani mein nahi jaavunga
Well, thanks for sharing this conversation with me. It seems that our time has come to an end. I hope you have a wonderful morning, afternoon, night wherever you are.	khair, iss baatchit koo merey saath saajha karane key liye dhanyavaad. aisaa lagata haye kii hamara samay khatm hoe gayaa haye. mujhe aasha haye kii aap jahaan bhee houn, aapaki subah, dopahar, raat bahut achchi hogi.	acha, aapse baath karne mein bahut dhanyavad. muje lagtha hein ki hamara time ab khatma ho raha hein, aapka din acha rahane ka mera subh kamna

was kinda cool tho	haalaanki yeh kaafee achchha thaa	kuch cool hein
Yes it is sort of the family type of film. But I got very much into the characters especially Hugh Jackman's.	haan, yeh ack tarah seey parivarik film haye. lekin main kirdaaron mein bahut gehrai taka ghus gayaa, khaskar hyu jackman key kirdar mein.	han, is film kuch family type ka hein.. lekin muje is characters jo especially hugh jakman se bahut impress hein
was interesting to see Hugh play a more domestic role	hyu koo adhik gharelu bhoomika nibhaate dekhana dilchasp thaa	hugh ko dekhne ka bahut interesting hein jo domestic role play karte
normally he's always a loner fighter type	aam taur parr vaha hamesha ack akela ladaakoo kism kaa hotaa haye	normally, voh lone fighter type ke hein
Yes but  he played it well and was able to pull it off.	haan, lekin unhone ise achche seey khela aur ise anjam dene mein safal rahey.	haan, lekin voh ache play kiye hein aur pull it off karne ka able hein
yeah he played the struggle of the character well	haan, unhone kirdar key sangharsh koo achche seey nibhaaya	haan, voh us character ko struggle karke play kiya hein
I always find it interesting to see what sort of demands actors can get into. I think he fit in with everyone else really well.	mujhe yeh dekhana hamesha dilchasp lagata haye kii abhineta kiss tarah kii maang curr sakate hain. mujhe lagata haye kii vaha harr kissy key saath bahut achche seey ghulmil jaataa haye.	Maine hamesha yeh interesting paya ki actors kis type ka demands kar sakte hai. Mujhe lagta hai wo sab ke sath thik se fit hai.
yeah the unusual mix of actors led to a coherent mixture	haan, abhinetaon key asamanya mishran seey ack susangat mishran taiyar huaa	yeh hai ek unusual mix actors ka jo bana ek coherent mixture.
That's definitley true.	yeh nishchit roop seey sach haye.	Yeh definitley true hai.
I enjoyed seeing all of the different robot fighters in the movie s well.	mujhe film mein sabhi alag-alag robot ladaakoo vimaanon koo dekhkar achchha lagaa.	Mujhe different type ke robot fighters movie me dekhne me pasand aye.
the new paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an everyday thing in the movie's world	load kiya gayaa nayaa paragraph mujhe yaad dilaata haye kii yeh tathya kitna dilchasp haye kii yeye robot film kii duniya mein rosemarra kii cheej they	Naye paragraph se mujhe robot ke interesting factor ka pata chala is movie world ke.
like he's just a lower-class dude but he owns a fighting robot	jaise kii vaha sirf ack nichale darje kaa aadami haye lekin usake paas ack ladaakoo robot haye	Woh ek lower-class ladka hai par uske paas ek fighting robot hai.

Yeh dikh raha hai kaise woh world se draw hue hai aur kaise ye robots sirf ek common chiz hai jo mujhe pasand bhi hai.
I thought about what it would be like to really live in that world	maine socha kii vaastav mein usa duniya mein rehna kaisa hoga	Main ne socha ki kis tarah us world me jiya jata hoga.

this guy still is in debt and so on	yeh aadami abhee bhee curz mein duba huaa haye ityaadi	Ye ladka abhi bhi debt me hai and rahega.
Yes no matter what we have basic life issues will never really change. They'll just come about in a new way.	haan, isase koee fark naheen padata kii hamaare jeevan key buniyaadi mudde vaastav mein kabhi naheen badalenge. way buss ack nae tareeke seey saamane aaenge.

Right. I suppose in many ways we were really supposed to see the robots as humans - more so than the actual humans. That's a really  interesting concept, I think.	sahee. meraa maanana ​​haye kii kaee mayanon mein hamein vaastav mein roboton koo insanon key roop mein dekhana chaahiye thaa - vaastavik insanon seey kaheen adhik. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh vaastav mein ack dilchasp avadharana haye.

Batman intercepts a drug shipment, provides Rachel with evidence against Falcone, and enlists Sergeant James Gordon, one of the few honest cops left in Gotham, to arrest him. In prison, Falcone meets with Dr. Jonathan Crane, a corrupt psychiatrist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham, and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare  him mentally unfit for trial. Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane (which causes Falcone to constantly mouth the  word "Scarecrow"), and has him transferred to Arkham Asylum. While investigating "the Scarecrow", Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. When Rachel accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into Gotham's water supply. He drugs Rachel with it, but Batman saves her and subdues Crane, who claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administers the antidote, and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. Ducard reappears at Bruce's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him.	batman ack drugg shipment koo rokta haye, rechel koo falcon key khilaf saboot pradaan kartaa haye, aur usey giraftar karane key liye gotham mein bache kuchh imandar puliskarmiyon mein seey ack, sargent james gorden koo shamil kartaa haye. jail mein, falcon kii mulakat ack bhrasht manochikitsak dow. jonathan crain seey hoti haye, jisaki usane gotham mein davaaon kii taskari mein madad kii haye, aur dhamki detaa haye kii aggar usane usey mukadame key liye mansik roop seey ayogya ghoshit naheen kiya tou vaha apani milibhagat kaa khulasa curr dega. crain ack bijuka mukhauta pahanati haye aur falcon parr darr utpann karane vaalaa matibhram chhidakati haye joe usey pagal banaa detee haye (jisake kaaran falcon lagaatar "scarecro" shabd bolata haye), aur usey arkham sharan mein sthanantarit curr diyaa jaataa haye.

it has war scenes or only posrwar scenes	isamen yuddh key drishya hain yaa kewal yuddh key drishya hain	usme war scenes hain ya only posrwar scenes hain
War scenes...more like just following these guys and their experiences and what people would do to escape (assume dead, pretend to be from another country)	yuddh key drishya... inn logon aur unake anubhavon kaa anusaran karane jaisa haye aur loga bachane key liye kyaa karenge (mrit maan lein, dusare desh seey honey kaa naatak karein)	War scenes ... wo un logon ko follow karna aur unke experiences ke baare mein jyada hai aur log escape karne ke liye kya kya karenge (assume dead, pretend to be from another country)

Yes I have seen it, and I found it quite good. It wasn't your typical Disney live-action, but it is due to this that it was great. definitely surpassed the ideas seen in Frozen.	haan, maine ise dekhaa haye aur mujhe yeh kaafee achchha lagaa. yeh aapka vishisht disney live-action naheen thaa, lekin iss vajah seey yeh bahut achchha thaa. nishchit roop seey frozen mein dekhe gaye vichaaron koo paar curr gayaa.	haan main dekha aur mujhe achha laga. yeh  disney live-action movie jaise nahin hain, us ke karan yeh movie bahut achhi hain. frozen se bhi bahut achha movie hain
Lol	zor-zor seey hansana	lol
The movie Maleficent is also a great look at the untold story of Sleeping Beauty	film mailficent bhee sleeping beauty kii anakahi kahani parr ack behtareen najar haye	movie maleficient bhi bahut achhi hain aur sleeping beauty ke  ankaha kahani dekho

So very true. I just like the digital look of the fairytale setting that plays off the original animated scenery.	bilkul sach haye. mujhe parikatha setting kaa digital look pasand haye joe mool animated drishyon koo pradarshit kartaa haye.	Bilkul sahi. Mujhe fairytale setting ka digital look pasand hai jo original animated scenery dikhata hai.
Are you a fan lf disney movies?	kyaa aap disney filmon key prashansak hain?	Kya tum disney movies ke fan ho?
This movie did cause me to loathe King stefan though... I mean he tore her wings off.	haalaanki iss film key kaaran mujhe king stephen seey nafrat hoe gaee... meraa matlab haye kii usane usake pankh toda diye.	Iss movie ne raja stefan ko kam karne ke liye kiya... Mera matlab usne apne wings kaat diye.
I like pirates of the Caribbean more than all the other Disney'	mujhe anya sabhi disney kii tulana mein pirates off dha carabian adhik pasand haye'	Mujhe pirates of the Caribbean sabhi Disney' movies se zyada pasand hai
Yes and No. I find that the animated films are quite nostalgic, but the live-action films like Maleficent in which you see the darkness behind the films cater better to me nowawdays.	haan aur naheen. mujhe lagata haye kii animated filmein kaafee purani yaaden taajaa karati hain, lekin mailficant jaisi live-action filmein, jinamen aap filmon key peechhe kaa andhera dekhate hain, aajkal mujhe behtar mahsoos karaati hain.	Han ye nhi. Mujhe lagta hai ki animated movies bahut nostalgic hoti hai, lekin live-action movies jaise Maleficent jis mein tum film ke peechhe andhera dekh skte ho ajakl zyada behtar hai mere.
True i think you are a good movie reader	sach haye mujhe lagata haye kii aap ack achche film paathak hain	Sach mujhe lagta hai ki tum ek achhe movie reader ho
Though I do find the Jerry Burckheimer productions better than Robert Stromberg who did Maleficent	haalaanki mujhe jairie berkheimer kii prastutiyaan robbert stromberg kii tulana mein behtar lagati hain jinhone mailficant banaai thee	Halanki mujhe Jerry Burckheimer productions better lagti hai Robert Stromberg jisne Maleficent banayi thi
Yes you are correct	haan tum thheek hoe	Han tum sahi ho
But Maleficent has a far more heartbreaking background than the Pirates movies.the background of Maleficent, and even the fact taht she cared for Aurora despite her villian status makes her likeable and hateable at the same time	lekin pirates filmon kii tulana mein mailficant kii prishthabhoomi kaheen adhik hridayavidaarak haye. mailficant kii prishthabhoomi, aur yahaan taka ​​kii yeh tathya kii vaha apani khalnayak sthiti key bavjood arora kii dekhbhal karati thee, usey ack hii samay mein pasand karane yogya aur nafrat karane yogya banaati haye.	But Maleficent ka background zyada heartbreaking and pirate movies se. Maleficient ka background, aur ye fact ki wo Aurora ki care krti hai jabki uska ek villan ka status hote hue bhi use likeable or hateable dono ek hi samay pe banata hai
Which ones are your favorite movies animated or action	aapaki pasandida animated yaa action filmein kaun see hain?	Tumhari konsi movies favorite hai animated ya action
How many times have you seen this movie	aapane yeh film kitni baar dekhi haye	Tumne yeh movie kitni baar dekhi hai
I quite have not seen the whole movie	maine poori film naheen dekhi haye	Maine yeh saari movie nhi dekhi
I like the action ones best I think. and ive only seen Maleficent once.... while the storyline was great, I am not complelled to watch it again.	mujhe lagata haye kii mujhe action vaale sabse achche lagate hain. aur maine mailficent koo kewal ack baar dekhaa haye.... jabaki kahani bahut achchi thee, main ise dobara dekhane key liye baadhy naheen huun.	Mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe action sabse achhi lagti hai. aur maine sirf ek baar Maleficent dekhi hai... jabki storyline bahut achhi thi, main isse phir se nhi dekhna chahta
Yes me too	haan mujhe bhee	Han main bhi
what parts have you seen	aapane kaun seey hisse dekhe hain	Tumne konse parts dekhe hai
To be honest i dont really remember much	sach kahuun tou mujhe vaastav mein bahut kuchh yaad naheen haye	Sach kahu to mujhe zyada yaad nhi hai
I mean I do give them credit for the live-action of the whole Phillip rescuing Aurora from Maleficent thing, but even with computers and the live-action, none of it did justice to the animated version where she turns into the dragon	meraa matlab haye kii main phillip dwara arora koo mailficant cheez seey bachaane key poore live-action kaa shreya unhein detaa huun, lekin computer aur live-action key saath bhee, isamen seey kissy ney bhee animated sanskaran key saath nyaay naheen kiya jahaan vaha dragon mein badal jaati haye	Mera matlab hai ki main use pure Philip ki live-action ke liye credit deta huin, jo ki sirf Maleficient ki cheezon se Aurora ko bachate hain, but yahan tak ki computers aur live-action ke saath, in mein se kisi ne bhi animated version ke saath justice nhi ki, jahan wo dragon mein badal jati hai
plus they added a darker element where King Stefan also falls to his death	saath hii unhone ack gahara tatva jodaa jahaan raajaa stephen kii bhee mrityu hoe jaati haye	unhone uske upar kala element add kiya uske vajahse raja stefan mar gaya
Well i do remember that part	khair mujhe vaha hissa yaad haye	ha mujhe wo part yad hai
Are you into movies critics	kyaa aap film sameekshakon mein ruchi rakhate hain?	tum movie crtics ho kya
I find this movie confuses me lol. You're happy she gets her wings back, but mad Aurora's dad died... or is that good too? He wasn't bad in the animated version.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh film mujhe bhramit karati haye. aap khush hain kii usey apane pankh vaapas mill gaye, lekin pagal aurora key pitaa kii mrityu hoe gaee... yaa yeh bhee achchha haye? animated sanskaran mein vaha buraa naheen thaa.	mujhe ye movie confuse krti hai. tum khush ki usko wings milte hai, but paga aurora ke dad marte hai.. ya ye bhi acha hai? wo bura nahi hai animated movie me
Eh I do take looks at Rotten Tomatoes here and there	aih, main yahaan-vahaan sadey hue tamataron parr nazar daaltaa huun	ha me rotten tomatoos pe dekhta rehata hu idhar udhar

I just saw it.	maine abhee ise dekhaa.	ha ,maine abi kuch der pahale dekha hoon.
Have you seen it?	kyaa aapane ise dekhaa haye?	aap dekha hai?
No, I usually like stuff with Benedict Cumberpatch though.	naheen, haalaanki mujhe aamtaur parr benedict comberbatch kii cheezen pasand hain.	nahi,main Benedict cumberpatch jaise movie  dekhtha hoon
It was such a thrilling movie. Based on the life of Alan Turing.	yeh bahut romanchkari film thee. ellen turing key jeevan parr adharit.	woh bada romanchakari movie tha.woh Alan Turing  ke jeevan ke bare me tha
Keira Knightly slightly annoys me however.	haalaanki keira nightly mujhe thodaa pareshan karati haye.	Keira Knightly mujeh achi nahi lagtha
Cumberbach was really the highlight of the film	comberbatch vaastav mein film kaa mukhya aakarshan thaa	Cumberbach film ke mukhya akarshan tha .
Got good reviews, Rotten tomatoes rarely goes over 90% it seems.	achchi sameekshaaen mileen, aisaa lagata haye kii sadey hue tamatar shayed hii kabhi 90% seey oopar jaate hain.	acha sameekhan mila , rotton tomatos ko 90% ke uper sameekshan nahi mila
Who is Alan Turing?	ellen turing kaun hain?	Alan Turing Kaun Hai
true. Metacritic gave them 73/100. Turing was a mathematician who was a cryptanalyst for the British during WWII against the Germans. He is famous for breaking the Enigma code.	satya. metacritic ney unhein 73/100 diye. turing ack ganitagya they joe dwiteeya vishva yuddh key dauran germans key viruddh angrejon key crypto vishleshak they. vaha anigma code koo todane key liye prasiddh hain.	sach hein yar, metacritic ne 73/100 diya tha. Turing toh mathematician hein jo british ke liye cryptanalyst  bane the tab wwii saari germans ke against the. aur voh enigma code ko break karne mein famous hein.
He was outed as a spy by the police who were investigating a break in at his home.	pulis ney usey ack jasus key roop mein baahar curr diyaa thaa joe usake ghar mein sendh kii jaanch curr rahee thee.	voh toh spy the aur police ke liye investigate kar rahe the, jo unka ghar break hogaya tha
Definitely see it if you get a chance.	mauka mille tou ise jaroor dekhiyega.	jarur dekh na agar aapko chance mila toh
Dramas tend to kind of bore me usually, with many note-worthy exceptions. I like Comedies mostly or fantasy, Sci-fi. I will check it out though, all in all i just love movies!	kaee ullekhaniya apvaadon koo chhodkar, naatak aamtaur parr mujhe boor karate hain. mujhe jyadatar comedy yaa fantasi, science-fiction pasand hain. haalaanki, main isaki jaanch karuungaa, kull milakar mujhe filmein hii pasand hain!	voh drama toh bore lagne laga usme jyada note worthy exceptions tha. muje comedies aur fantasy pasand aaya especially sci-fi. mein check kar lunga, overall muje movies pasand hein
Sounds like an interesting fellow, will definetly give it a watch.	ack dilchasp saathi kii tarah lagata haye, nishchit roop seey ise dekhunga.	lagtha hein interest se rahega, jarur mein watch karunga
It is really more of an espionage movie. It is pretty exciting. I guess there is some drama with his experiences in boarding school and studying with Morcom, his mentor.	yeh vaastav mein ack jasusi film seey adhik haye. yeh kaafee romanchak haye. mujhe lagata haye kii boarding school aur apane guru morcom key saath padhaai key unake anubhavon mein kuchh naatak haye.	han yar yeh toh espionage movie nikla. bahut excite hein usme. muje lagtha hein ki usme kuch drama apni boarding school ka experiences mein se likha hoga aur morcom mein padne se likha hoga jo uska mentor tha
I think you will enjoy it.	mujhe lagata haye kii aap iska aanand uthaayenge.	muje laga ki tu enjoy karega
Morton Tyldum is a great director.	morton tiledum ack mahaan nirdeshak hain.	morton tyldum bahut badiya director hein
Andrew grant and that rag science news never gets it right, if he liked it i will probably hate it.	andreau grant aur vaha raig science samachar kabhi bhee sahee naheen hotaa, aggar usey yeh pasand aayaa tou main shayed isase nafrat karunga.	voh andrew grant aur uska rag science ka news kabhi bhi right nahi hota, agar voh ushe pasand aaya tho mein use hate karunga
The hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of Cumberpatch as i am.	aisaa lagata haye kii hollywood reporter comberpatch kaa utana hii shaukeen haye jitna main huun.	voh hollywood reporter toh cumberpatch nikhla, jaisa mein hoon.
It is kind of technical. It goes pretty in depth about his machine to break the code. He has some breakthroughs when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows. You will probably enjoy that.	yeh ack tarah seey takniki haye. isamen code koo todane vaali usaki machine key baare mein kaafee gehrai seey bataaya gayaa haye. usey kuchh safalataaen mileen jaba usey ehsas huaa kii vaha ise una shabdon key saath prograam curr sakata haye jinhen vaha pahale seey jaanata haye. aap shayed iska anand lenge.	ye technical type ka hai, code break karne ke liye machine me bahut deep jana padta hai. use ek breakthrough milta hai jab use ye realize hota hai ki wo use pahle se malulm words se wo is program kar sakta hai. tum enjoy karoge ise.
Cumberbach does a great job acting.	comberback bahut achchha abhinay karate hain.	kamal ki acting ki hai Cumberbach ne.
These storys based on true stories tend to always add so much stuff to keep it interesting that it kinda distorts history in my opinion.	sachchi kahaaniyon parr adharit yeye kahaaniyan hamesha dilchasp banaae rakhane key liye itani saaree cheezen jodd detee hain kii merrie raay mein yeh itihas koo vikrit curr detee hain.	mere opinion me true stories pe based ye story hamesha history ko distort karti hain use interesting banane ke liye.
The bit about getting married to Keira Knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting. I might warn you about all that.	yadi aap keira nightly key abhinay key prati pakshapaati naheen hain tou keira nightly seey shaadi karane kii baat aapke liye kashtprad hoe sakati haye. main aapako usa sub key baare mein chetavani dey sakata huun.	Keira Knightley se marriage ko lekar jo wakya hai, wo thoda annoying hai agar aap uski acting ko leke thode favorable nahi hai to. tumhe iske bare me warn kar raha hu.
It is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life. I see your point there.	yeh dilchasp haye kyonki yeh film unake jeevan parr adharit ack kitab parr adharit naatak parr adharit haye. main vahaan aapaki baat dekhta huun.	interesting baat ye hai ki yah movie us play par based hai, jo uski life par likhi book par based hai. tumhara point dekh sakta hu mai.
I would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film, the good acting, and even the half made up story!	main shayed film key takniki pahaluon, achche abhinay aur yahaan taka ​​kii aadhi-adhuri kahani kaa anand loonga!	mai probably film ke technical aspect ko enjoy karu, badhiya acting, aur half cooked story.
I think also where it is a movie about a mathematician, it kind of helps to add in some plot elements. I think this is unusual though as his life was so interesting.	mujhe yeh bhee lagata haye kii jahaan yeh ack ganitagya key baare mein film haye, vahaan yeh kuchh kathaanak tatvon koo jodane mein madad karati haye. haalaanki mujhe lagata haye kii yeh asamanya haye kyonki unaka jeevan bahut dilchasp thaa.	I think also yah movie ek mathematician ke baare men hai, plot me thode elements dalna helpful hai. par mujhe ye unusual laga kyonki uski life to waise hi itni interesting hai.
There is quite a bit of espionage involved as well. I suppose I am not spoiling it since it is history, but there is some Russian collusion involved.	isamen kaafee matra mein jasusi bhee shamil haye. meraa maanana ​​haye kii main ise kharab naheen curr rhaa huun kyonki yeh itihas haye, lekin isamen kuchh russie milibhagat shamil haye.	isme espionage ka angle bhi involve hai. I suppose mai  kuch spoil nahi kar raha hu kyonki ye history hai, but kuch Russian secret bhi involved hai.
If he marries Keira knightly i may be shouting at my T.V.	aggar vaha keira seey shaadi curr letaa haye tou shayed main apane tii.vee. parr chillaaungi.	agar wo Keira knightly se marriage karega to mai shayad T.V. par hi shout karne lagu.
Big drama when Turing confronts the russians.	jaba turing kaa rusiyon seey saamana huaa tou badaa naatak.	bada drama hua jab Turning Russians ko confront karta hai.
Yeah you might have to fast forward through the lurid romance. It is not so bad though.	haan, aapako kamuk romans key madhyam seey teji seey aage badhana parh sakata haye. haalaanki yeye itna buraa naheen haye.	haan, aapako phurteela romaans ke maadhyam se aage badhana hoga. yah haalaanki itana bura nahin hai.
She is trite, absolutely, but the director does make it work here.	vaha bilkul ghisi-pitty haye, lekin nirdeshak ise yahaan kaam karate hain.	vah bilkul trait hai, lekin nirdeshak ise yahaan kaam karate hain.
also, turns out he is gay!	yeh bhee pataa chalaa kii vaha samalaingik haye!	yah bhee pata chala ki vah samalaingik hai!
so she gets what she deserves.	isaliye usey vahee milata haye jisaki vaha hakdar haye.	isalie use vah milata hai jisaka vah hakadaar hai.
you might actualy like it.	aap vaastav mein ise pasand curr sakate hain.	aap ise pasand kar sakate hain.
I didn't really get that part, but who can understand the gays?	mujhe vaastav mein vaha hissa naheen milaa, lekin samlaingikon koo kaun samajh sakata haye?	mujhe vaastav mein vah hissa nahin mila, lekin samalaingikon ko kaun samajh sakata hai?
Well, that kinda of makes it more inviting to me, Keira Nightly must be sad to find that out!	khair, yeh baat ise merey liye aur adhik aakarshak banaati haye, keira nightly koo yeh jaankar dukh huaa hoga!	khair, yah thode ise aur adhik mere lie aamantrit karata hai, keira naitalee ko yah pata lagaane ke lie dukhee hona chaahie!
yeah I think she was pretty upset. Like I said I didn't really understand all of that. I was mostly in it for the math. What an interesting, fascinating story.	haan, mujhe lagata haye kii vaha kaafee pareshan thee. jaisa kii maine kahaa, main vaastav mein vaha sub samajh naheen paaya. main jyadatar ganit key liye isamen thaa. kitni dilchasp, dilchasp kahani haye.	haan, mujhe lagata hai ki vah bahut pareshaan thee. jaisa mainne kaha ki main vaastav mein us sab ko samajh nahin paaya hoon. main jyaadaatar ganit ke lie isamen tha. kya dilachasp, aakarshak kahaanee hai.
I think Turing was gay for his mentor or something, but he dies.	mujhe lagata haye kii turing apane guru yaa kissy anya kaaran seey samalaingik thaa, lekin usaki mrityu hoe gaee.	mujhe lagata hai ki tyooring apane guru ya kuchh aur ke lie samalaingik tha, lekin vah mar jaata hai.
Sounds a bit like Beautiful mind that was a great movie, too!	kuchh-kuchh beautiful mind jaisa lagata haye, vaha bhee ack behtareen film thee!	sundar dimaag kee tarah lagata hai ki ek mahaan philm thee, bhee!
Tuberculosis.	kshay roga.	Tuberculosis.
Yeah I did love Beautiful mind. I read that that guy actually was working for the government.	haan, mujhe beautiful mind pasand aayaa. maine padhaa kii vaha vyakti vaastav mein sarkaar key liye kaam curr rhaa thaa.	Haan Beautiful mind accha laga.maine padha hai woh government main kaam karta tha.
Talk about changing the story!	kahani badalane kii baat karo!	story badalne ke baare main batao!
Turing's story is pretty sad. He got bullied a lot at boarding school. Seems to have affected him a lot. Too bad he wasn't able to find love. Maybe he should have gone for somebody besides Kiera Knightley!	turing kii kahani bahut dukhad haye. boarding school mein unhein bahut pareshan kiya gayaa. lagata haye usa parr bahut assar padaa haye. bahut buraa huaa kii usey pyaar naheen mill paaya. shayed usey keeraa nightly key alawa kissy aur key liye jaanaa chaahiye thaa!	Turing ki story bahut sad hai. usko boarding school main bahut bully kia gaya.Lagta hai woh bahut affect hua. Too bad use love nahin mila. Maybe use Kiera Knightley ke alava kisi aur ko jaana chahiye tha!
How come you dislike her so much?	aap usey itna napsand kaise karate hain?	kaise tum use itna dislike kar sakte ho?
Is it because you guys used to date?	kyaa aisaa isaliye haye kyonki aap loga dett karate they?	kya isliye ki tum log dating karte the?
Mostly just for hogging that driftwood in Titanic ;)	adhikatar titanic mein usa driftwod koo pakadane key liye;)	Mostly driftwood ke hogging ke liye Titanic mein:)
Oh yeah. I have never seen that one.	arey haan. maine vaha kabhi naheen dekhaa.	Oh haan. Maine kabhi nahin dekha tha usko.
I find her Wiry, trite, and egotistical. I only enjoy those qualities in myself.	mujhe vaha ajib, ghisi-pitty aur ahankari lagati haye. main kewal apane aap mein una gunon kaa anand letaa huun.	mujhe woh Wiry,trite aur egotistical laga. Mujhe sirf who qualities apne mein lagta hai.
I know there is that song by celine dion.	main jaanata huun kii selene dione kaa vaha gaanaa haye.	mujhe malum hai woh song celine dion se hai.
haha that is funny. I figured that but didn't want to say.	haaha yeh hasyaspad haye. mujhe yeh samajh mein aayaa lekin main kahana naheen chaahata thaa.	Ha Bahut hi majedar hai. Hum ko malum tha ki bat karna nahi chahete
She is kind of a walking plattitude. Kind of like Reese Witherspoon, but more indiana less texas	vaha ack tarah seey chalane firane vaali mahila haye. reez vidaraspoon kii tarah, lekin texas cumm indiana adhik	Woh ladki chalne wali sadharan hai. Reese Witherspoon ki tarah, lekin jyada indiana aur kum Texas
or something	yaa kuchh aur	ya kuch kuch
Oh, its ok. Im not blind. However after looking at Keira Knightley for 2 hours i might be.	oh, yeh thheek haye. main naheen banaaya gayaa huun. haalaanki 2 ghante taka keira nightly koo dekhane key baad shayed main aisaa curr paauunga.	Arey teek hai. Hum andha nahi hai. Lekin do ghante tak hum Keira Knightly ko dekhne ke badh,  ho sakta hai
Still the story sounds like one of importance that should be told, ill have to tune in.	phir bhee yeh kahani ack mahatvapurna kahani lagati haye jise bataaya jaanaa chaahiye, mujhe isamen shamil honah padegaa.	Phir bhi is kahani aisa mahatwa lagta hai ki sabhi ko batana chahiye. Humko sunna padega.
anyways she didn't ruin the movie. If anything, Turing's life ruins the movie. It's just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love. He could have just worked out, made some friends, and been happy. It is a very important story. Reminds me of the life of Charles Darwin, or Plato.	vaise bhee usane film koo barbad naheen kiya. kuchh bhee hoe, turing kaa jeevan film koo barbad curr detaa haye. yeh bahut dukhad haye kii usey dhamkaya jaataa haye aur vaha samalaingik prem kii sharan letaa haye. vaha buss kaam curr sakata thaa, kuchh dost banaa sakata thaa aur khush reh sakata thaa. yeh ack bahut hii mahatvapurna kahani haye. mujhe charles darwin yaa plato key jeevan kii yaad aatee haye.	Vise bhi usne philam ko barbad nahi kiya. Turing ka jeevan film ko barbad kar deta hai. Bahut dukh ki bat hai ki voh tung agaya aur sam legik prem ka sharan leta hai. Woh kam kar sakta tha, kuch dost bana sakta tha, aur khush reha sakta tha. Yeh to ek bahut hi mahatpurna kahani hai. Charles Darwin ya Plato ka yad dilata hai.
oh, I really like Reese, Not sure what that says about me.	oh, mujhe sachmuch reez pasand haye, nishchit naheen kii vaha merey baare mein kyaa kahata haye.	Arre, mujhe vastavme Reez pasand hai, lakin woh mere bare me kya bolta hai malum nahi hai
That is funny but you don't like Kiera.	yeh hasyaspad haye lekin aapako kiara pasand naheen haye.	Yeh majak ki bat hai lekin apko Kiera pasand nahi hai.
I thought Cumberbach made a great Turing, but it would have been funnier if they cast eminem.	maine socha kii comberback ney ack mahaan turing banaai haye, lekin aggar way eminem koo cast karate tou yeh adhik majedar hotaa.	Mujhe laga ki Cumberbakh ne ek mahan turing banaya hai agar woh eminem dalte hai to aur hi majedar hota.
Fitness is very important. Im a big fan of Darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story.	fitness bahut jaruri haye. main darwin kaa bahut badaa prashansak huun, isaliye kahani mein merrie dilchaspi thodi aur badh gaee haye.	Fitness bahut jaruri hai. Mi Darwin ka bada prasanshak hai jise mujhe kahani me aur dilchaspi huyi.
Well, Darwin had a rough time on the beagle. He was the captain's special steward, which was a demanding job, if you know what I mean.	khair, darwin koo beagle key mamle mein kathin samay kaa saamana karna padaa. vaha kaptan kaa vishesh prabandhak thaa, joe ack kathin kaam thaa, yadi aap jaanate hain kii meraa kyaa matlab haye.	कुंआ, daarvin ko beegal par ek kathin samay tha. vah kaptaan ke khaas steward tha, jo ek maangalik kaary tha, yadi tumhen maaloom hai ki mera kya matalab hai.

But you can see the love story coming from the start.	lekin aap prem kahani koo shuru seey hii dekh sakate hain.	Lekin tum us prem kahani ko dekh sakte ho jo shuru se shuru hui.
I find it annoying when they feel they have to add love stories to everything.	mujhe yeh kashtprad lagata haye jaba unhein lagata haye kii unhein harr cheez mein prem kahaaniyan jodani hongi.	Jab unko lagta hai ki unhe har cheez mein prem kahani daal deni chaiye tab mujhe chid hoti hai.
But her character still works besides the flirting.	lekin unaka kirdar abhee bhee flirting key alawa kaam kartaa haye.	Par uska charitra flirting ke baad bhi chalega.
See that's why I only remember war thing	dekhiye, isiliye mujhe sirf yuddh kii baat yaad aatee haye	Dekho isilye mujhe sirf ladai ki cheeze yaad hai
I know - it's more fun to watch, more action-oriented.	main jaanata huun - ise dekhana adhik manoranjak haye, adhik kriya-unmukh haye.	mujhe pata hai action-oriented dekhne me jyada mazha aata hai
What about the technology in the movies - do you like the way it's presented?	filmon mein praudyogiki key baare mein kyaa khyaal haye - kyaa aapako ise prastut karane kaa tarika pasand haye?	movies ke technology ke baare mein kya - kya tumhe pasand hai jis tarah se woh present kiye jate hai?
I loved the electro magnet in his heart.	mujhe usake dill mein vidyut chumbak pasand thaa.	mujhe uske dil pe lagi electro magnet se pyaar tha
oh by the way, I love his attitude in serious fights, humor with music	oh, vaise, mujhe gambhir jhagadon mein uska ravaiya, sangeet key saath haasy pasand haye	oh waise bhi, mujhe pasand hai uska attitude serious fights mein, humor music ke saath
I know! He's one of the best actors for super hero movies because he doesn't take himself too seriously.	mujhe pataa haye! vaha super hiro filmon key liye sarvshreshth abhinetaon mein seey ack hain kyonki vaha khud koo bahut gambhirta seey naheen lete hain.	mujhe pata hai, woh super hero movies mein sabse achcha actor hai kyunki woh apne aap ko seriously nahin leeta.
Gotta go now - fun talking with you!	abb jaanaa hoga - aapke saath baat karke majaa aayaa!	gotta go now - tumse baat karne mein mazha aaya!

Is Emma Stone playing an artist also?	kyaa emma stone bhee ack kalakar kii bhoomika nibha rahee hain?	kya Emma Stone bhi artist play kar rahi hai?
She is a aspiting actress in this film. They are both pursuing their dreams.	iss film mein vaha ack mahatvakankshi abhinetri hain. way donon apane sapnon kaa peechha curr rahey hain.	wo film mein aspiting actress hai, dono apne khawab pursue kar rahe hain
What part does John Legend play?	johnn leasand ney kaun see bhoomika nibhai haye?	John Legend kaunsa part play kar raha hai?
I am not sure what part he pays. In the first part Ryan Gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of I Ran (So far Away), he feels like the song is an isult for a serious musician	mujhe yakeen naheen haye kii vaha kiss hisse kaa bhugtan kartaa haye. pahale bhaag mein rayan gosling ack party mein hain aur vaha aaee raine (sou phaar away) kaa cover bajaate hain, unhein lagata haye kii yeh gaanaa ack gambhir sangeetkaar kaa upman haye	muje yaad nahi ki voh kya part me pay kara hoga. pehla part mein toh Ryan Gosling party mein they aur I Ran ko play kar rahe the, lagtha tha ki voh song kisi serious musician ko insult kar rahe hein
What is the time period of the movie? Is it a modern story?	film kii samayaavadhi kyaa haye? kyaa yeh ack aadhunik kahani haye?	Kis time period ka movie hey yar? Modern story hein kya?
Yes I think it is modern time period	haan, mujhe lagata haye kii yeh aadhunik samay haye	haan yar yeh toh modern time period ki hoga
Have you seen the movie?	kyaa aap movie dekh chuke hain?	kya tu is movie ko dekha kya?
No I have not seen it yet, I want to though. I want to know if they stay together or they have a struggle with their relationship	naheen, maine ise abhee taka naheen dekhaa haye, phir bhee main dekhana chaahata huun. main jaanana chaahata huun kii kyaa way saath rahate hain yaa unhein apane rishte koo laker koee pareshani haye	nahi yar, bas soch raha hoon ki dekhen. muje yaha patha chalna hey ki agar voh dono mil jaathe ya aapas me struggle karte unka relationship
Relationships are tough. I wonder how the two characters handle theirs.	rishte kathin hain. mujhe ashcharya haye kii donon kirdar apane kirdaaron koo kaise sambhaalate hain.	Relationship toh tough hei yar. mein toh aacharya huva ki voh dono kaise yeh handle karte
Emma who plays Mia, writes her own one women play. That sound interesting! Ryan who is playing Sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together. I am thinking they sound like a fun couple.	miya kaa kirdar nibhaane vaali emma apana khud kaa ack mahila naatak likhati hain. yeh dilchasp lagata haye! rayan joe sebastian kaa kirdar nibha rhaa haye, ack club mein niyamit pradarshan curr rhaa haye aur way ack saath rahate hain. main soch rhaa huun kii way ack mazedaar jodee kii tarah lugg rahey hain.	Emma jo Mia ka role play kiya voh apni aap hi yek women ko play kiya. voh toh bada interesting hey! Ryan jo Sebastian ka role play kiya voh regularly yek club mein perform kar rahe they aur dono move kiya. muje lagtha hein ki dono fun couple hein.
Do you know what the play is about?	kyaa aap jaanate hain kii naatak kiss baare mein haye?	aap ko patha hein ki yeh play konsa baare mein hein?
No, sadly I do not know what it is about. I do know that Sebastian does not enjoy the music his band plays in	naheen, dukh kii baat haye kii mujhe naheen pataa kii yeh kiss baare mein haye. main jaanata huun kii sebastian koo apane baind kaa sangeet pasand naheen haye	nahi yar, sadly muje iske baare mein kuch patha nahi. lakin yeh toh patha ki sebastian ko uska music band ka play bilkul pasand nahi aaya
Is there alot of dancing also?	kyaa khoob dance bhee hotaa haye?	kya kahi dancing bhi hein kya?
I am not sure on that, but I would think there is. Sounds like it is filled with music! I love a good musical	main iss parr nishchit naheen huun, lekin mujhe lagata haye kii aisaa haye. aisaa lagata haye jaise yeh sangeet seey bharaa huaa haye! mujhe achchha sangeet pasand haye	main us par sure nahi hun, but mujhe lagta hai ki wanha hai. Pratit hota hai jaise ye music se bhara hua hai! Mujhe good musical se pyaar hai
I do too, if it is done well.	aggar yeh achche seey kiya jaae tou main bhee aisaa kartaa huun.	main bhi karta hun, if ise acche se kiya jaye.
Does Emma Stone sing as well?	kyaa emma stone bhee gaati hain?	kya Emma stone bhi accha sing kar sakti hai?
When their band has the first tour Mis and Sebastian get into an argument! He thinks she wants him to be unsuccessful	jaba unake baind kaa pahala daura huaa tou miss aur sebastian mein bahas hoe gaee! vaha sochata haye kii vaha chaahati haye kii vaha asafal hoe	Jab unke band ka first tour tha, Mis aur Sebastian argument me pad gaye! Use lagta hai ki wo use unsuccessful karna chahti hai.
That doesn't bode well for the relationship.	yeh rishte key liye achchha naheen haye.	ye relanship ke liye acchi bode nahi hai.
I think she is just an aspiring actress, not a singer. He misses her first play where noone shows up, and she owes the theater money and moves to Nevada since she can not pay. Getting very interesting!	mujhe lagata haye kii vaha sirf ack mahatvakankshi abhinetri hain, gayika naheen. vaha usake pahale naatak koo miss curr detaa haye jahaan koee bhee naheen aataa haye, aur usa parr theatre kaa paisa bakaaya haye aur vaha nevada chully jaati haye kyonki vaha bhugtan naheen curr sakati haye. bahut dilchasp hoe rhaa haye!	Mujhe lagta hai wo ek aspiring actress hai, na ki singer. Wo apna first play miss karti hai janha koi dekhne wala nahi hoga tha, aur wah theater ke money ko owes karke Nevada chali jaati hai kyunki wo pay nahi kar sakti. Ye bada interesting ho gaya.
Does he go with her to Nevada?	kyaa vaha usake saath nevada jaataa haye?	Kya wo uske saath Nevada gaya?
No, she is mad and not forgiving him for missing her play. Her first play sounds like it was a bust	naheen, vaha pagal haye aur apana khel naa dikhaane key liye usey maaf naheen curr rahee haye. uska pahala naatak aisaa lagata haye jaise yeh ack halchal thee	No, wo mad thi aur usne use play ko miss karne ke liye forgive nahi kiya. Uska first play aisa laga jaise wo bust ho gaya ho.
It sounds like it. Writing plays must be difficult. Sounds like she took it hard.	aisaa lagata haye. naatak likhana kathin hoga. aisaa lagata haye jaise usane ise bahut mushkil seey liya.	Aisa lagta hai ki wo accha hai. Play writing difficult hoga. Aisa lagta hai usne use hard liya hai.
John Legend plays Keith, he is a band member. I bet hes a great bank member!	johnn leasand ney keath kii bhoomika nibhai haye, vaha ack baind sadasya hain. mujhe yakeen haye kii vaha ack mahaan baink sadasya haye!	John Legend ne keith ka role play kiya, wo ek band member hai. Me bet karta hun ki wo ek great bank member hai.
I bet you are right.	mujhe yakeen haye aap sahee hain.	Main bet lga skta huin ki tum sahi ho.
I am sure she just did not have enough experience for the play writing and how to execute the play and promote it.	mujhe yakeen haye kii usake paas naatak likhane aur naatak koo nishpaadit karane aur ise badhaava dene key liye paryaapt anubhav naheen thaa.	Main sure huin ki usse enough experience  nhi hai play likhne ka or use execute or promote krne ka.
Well, this sounds like an interesting movie. Thanks for all the information.	khair, yeh ack dilchasp film lagati haye. sabhi jaankaari key liye shukriya.	Khair, ye ek interesting movie lagti hai. Thanks sabhi information ke liye.
I do hope you will see it. I want to see how the realtionship plays out during the film.	mujhe aasha haye kii aap ise dekhenge. main dekhana chaahata huun kii film key dauran rishte kaise chalate hain.	Main hope krta huin ki tum isse dekhoge. Main dekhna chahta huin ki realtionship kaise chlta hai film mein.
Sounds great.	bahut achchha lagata haye.	Bahut badia lagta hai.
The Inception was given a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 86%.	inception koo rotten tomatose rating 86% dee gaee thee.	The Inception ko 86% ka Rotten Tomatoes rating given he.
I see Leonardo DiCaprio starred in it as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page and Tom Hardy.	main dekhta huun kii isamen leonardo dicaprio key saath-saath joseph gorden-levit, elen pays aur tomm hardy ney bhee abhinay kiya haye.	me dekha  Leonardo DiCaprio isme starred he as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page aur Tom Hardy.
86% is a fair rating.  I felt that this movie was excellent but somewhat 'heady'.  I could see why it isn't everyone's cup of tea.  What rating would you give Inception?	86% ack uchit rating haye.  mujhe lagaa kii yeh film behtareen thee lekin kuchh hudd taka 'maadak' thee.  main samajh sakaa kii yeh harr kissy key buss kii baat kyon naheen haye.  aap inception koo kyaa rating denge?	86% fair rating he. Mujhe laga ki ye movie excellent he but somewhat "heady" he.me dekh sakta hu ki kyu ye everyone ka cup of tea he.Tum Inception ko kya rating dete?
I agree. 86% seems fair.	main sahmat huun. 86% uchit lagata haye.	me agree hu. 86% fair lagti he.
There were some interesting characters in this movie. What character did you relate to most?	iss film mein kuchh dilchasp kirdar they. aap kiss kirdar seey sabse jyada judey hue hain?	Is movie me kuch interesting character the.Kis character se tum sabse adhik relate karte ho?
Leonardo DiCaprio was compelling in the role of Dom.  The Inception seems like a tailor fit role for DiCaprio.  I enjoyed his performance but found that the plot was so inventive that I had a hard time relating directly to any of the characters.  It seemed too divorced from reality.	domm kii bhoomika mein leonardo dicaprio damdar lagey they.  inception dicaprio key liye bilkul upayukt bhoomika kii tarah lagata haye.  maine unake pradarshan kaa anand liya lekin paaya kii kathaanak itna aavishkaarsheel thaa kii mujhe kissy bhee paatr seey seedhe judane mein kathinaaee hui.  yeh vaastaviktaa seey bahut alag lugg rhaa thaa.	Leonardo DiCaprio, Dom ke role me Compelling tha.The Inception ka role lagta he ki DiCaprio ke liye tailor fit role tha.mene uska performance enjoy kiya but  mujhe laga ki role itna inventive tha ki kis bhi character se directly  relate karna mere liye  hard he.
Did this movie make you ponder the origins of your own thoughts?	kyaa iss film ney aapako apane vichaaron kii utpatti parr vichaar karane parr majboor kiya?	Kya is movie ne tumhe tumhari soch ke baare mein sochne pe majboor kiya?
Well, it was interesting, to say the least. The idea of planting something into another persons subconscious made me think for sure.	khair, cumm seey cumm itna tou kahaa hii jaa sakata haye kii yeh dilchasp thaa. dusare vyakti key avachetan mein kuchh ropane key vichaar ney mujhe nishchit roop seey sochane parr majboor curr diyaa.	Well, kam bolna interesting tha. Kisi dusre ke subconscious mein kuch plant karne ke idea nei mujhe sure kar diya.
It was pretty "out there".	yeh bahut sunder "vahaan seey baahar" thaa.	Bahar bahut sunder h.
Do you like scientific movies?	kyaa aapako vaigyaanik filmein pasand hain?	Kya tumhe scientific movies h?
I adore them.  The more "out there" the better.	main unhein pyaar kartaa huun.  jitna adhik "vahaan seey baahar" utana behtar.	I unse pyar h. Bahar bahut better h.
Did you notice the complexity of the dreamscapes in the movie? I thought it was very inventive.	kyaa aapane film mein swapn drishyon kii jatilata parr dhyaan diyaa? maine socha kii yeh bahut aavishkaarsheel thaa.	kya tumne movie mein dreamscapes ki complexity ko notice kiya? Mujhe laga yaha bahut inventive h.
I'm having a hard time recalling some of the specifics.  It's hard to believe this film is almost 10 years old already!  I do recall them growing increasingly more complex and dream like the deeper they went though.	mujhe kuchh vishisht baatein yaad karane mein kathinaaee hoe rahee haye.  yeh vishvaas karna kathin haye kii yeh film lagbhag 10 saal purani haye!  mujhe yaad haye kii way aur adhik jatil hotey jaa rahey they aur jaise-jaise way gahare hotey gaye vaise hii sapane dekhate rahey.	Mujhe kuch specific yaad nai aa rahi h. yaha believe karna mushkil h ki yaha movie 10 saal purani h! Mujhe yaad aa raha h ki yaha din b din complex and dream like ho rhi h.
Did you notice in each dream there was a "kick"?	kyaa aapane dekhaa kii pratyek sapane mein ack "kick" thee?	kya tune notice kiya ki har ek dream mein ek kick h
I did, I loved it!  It was like a dreamy Rube Goldberg contraption.	maine kiya, mujhe yeh pasand aayaa!  yeh ack swapnil roob goldberg yantra kii tarah thaa.	Maine kiya, yaha mujhe pasand h! Yaha dremy Rube Goldberg contraption ki tarah h.
Can you imagine yourself in a similar scenario?  They must have had a tremendous amount of trust for each other.  If anything went wrong they could have ended up in 'limbo'.	kyaa aap swayam koo aise hii paridrishya mein kalpana curr sakate hain?  unamen ack-dusare key prati bahut adhik vishvaas rhaa hoga.  aggar kuchh bhee galat hotaa tou way 'amar' sthiti mein funce sakate they.	kya tum apne aap ko same scenario mein imagine kar sakte ho? Unme bahut jyada trust hona chahiye. Yadi kuch bhi wrong hota h to wo limlbe mein khatm ho sakta h
I couldn't imagine it. Sounds very risky. Especially if the dreamer dies in the dream before the sedative wears off.	main isaki kalpana naheen curr sakaa. bahut jokhim bharaa lagata haye. khaskar yadi sapane dekhane vaalaa shaamak aushadhi key khatm honey seey pahale hii marr jaataa haye.	mein imagine bhi nahi saktha. voh toh badi risky sound kartha. expecially voh dreamer apna dream mein hi mar jaatha uska sedative wear karne ke pehle hi
If the dreamer died and you end up in 'limbo', where do you think that is?  All of the extractors are living within that consciousness, what would become of them?  (since if he dies, that consciousness will cease to exist.)	yadi swapn dekhane vaalaa marr gayaa aur aap 'amar' sthiti mein pahunch gaye, tou aapke anusaar vaha kahaan haye?  sabhi nikaalane vaale usa chetna key bheetar reh rahey hain, unaka kyaa hoga?  (choonki yadi vaha marr gayaa, tou usa chetna kaa astitva samaapt hoe jaayega.)	agar dreamer mar gaya toh limbo mein end hotha. kaise aise kar sakthe? sabhi extractors issi consciousness mein hi jee rahe hein. kya yeb sab ban baayenge?
Good question, and very thought provoking. In the movie they just went into limbo but I suppose the subconscious dreams would have to adjust to fit the new scenario. It would be scary to have the possibility of forgetting that you are in a dream at all. Do you think it would be worth  the potential setback?	achchha prashn haye, aur bahut vichaarottejak haye. film mein way buss adhar mein latak gaye lekin mujhe lagata haye kii avachetan sapnon koo nae paridrishya mein fitt honey key liye samaayojit karna hoga. yeh bhoolana daravana hoga kii aap sapane mein hain. kyaa aapako lagata haye kii yeh sambhaavit jhatake key laayak hoga?	ache question kaafi provoking thought hein. is movie mein voh limbo ke liye gaye hein kyon ki mein subconscious dream par is scenario ko nahi mil paatha. bahut scary dream hein. kya aap ko is potential setback ke baare mein kya haal chaal hein
I think that possibility is much greater than a setback.  I took it to mean that all the extractors as well as the subject would be trapped forever.  In that way it seems much too risky.  The aim is to plant an idea in someones mind without their realizing it, almost like mind control.  I think it would me much easier, and less risky, to sit and negotiate with someone.  Although, that's not at all subversive.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh sambhavana kissy jhatake seey kaheen adhik badee haye.  maine iska matlab yeh nikala kii sabhi nikaalane vaale aur saath hii vishay hamesha key liye funce jaayenge.  aise mein yeh bahut jyada jokhim bharaa lagata haye.  iska uddeshya kissy key dimag mein binaa usey ehsas hue ack vichaar dalna haye, lagbhag dimag parr niyantran kii tarah.  mujhe lagata haye kii kissy key saath baithana aur baatchit karna merey liye bahut aasaan aur cumm jokhim bharaa hoga.  haalaanki, yeh bilkul bhee vidhvansak naheen haye.	muje lagtha hein ki is setback thoda jyada hein. muje lagtha hein ki sabhi extractors ko is subject ko trapped kiye gaye hein. is tarah mein toh yeh jyada risky nazar aa raha hein. uska aim ka plant toh koi dusri ka idea hoga jo koi mind control kiya hein. mein soch raha hun ki voh jyada easier ho tha aur risky bhi kam hota aur negotiate bhi kar sakthe. magar sab koi subversive nahi hote
Good point. What did you think about what happened to Mal?	achchi baat. mull key saath joe huaa usake baare mein aapane kyaa socha?	ache point hein. toh aap us mal ko kya huva?
Mal's conflict is pivotal to this film.  For all the layers of intrigue we have diving down into the dreams of the target, Mal's actions plant the idea in our minds that there could be many layers above as well.  Is the reality we began this film in reality at all?  What do you think?	maal kaa sangharsh iss film key liye mahatvapurna haye.  saazish kii sabhi paraton key liye humm lakshy key sapnon mein gotaa lagaa rahey hain, maal kii harkatein hamaare dimag mein yeh vichaar daalati hain kii oopar bhee kaee paraten hoe sakati hain.  kyaa hamane iss film kii shuruat asal mein kii haye?  aap kyaa sochate hain?	mal ka conflick is film mein pivotal hein. toh sabhi intrigue ko is dream ka target diving hota hein, Mals ka action plant ka idea toh badi layers hein.. reality mein toh is film thoda jyada hi reality ho gaya. kya aap kya sochte hein?
Reality as we know it can be hard. If there was an alternate reality available that was more enjoyable I could see where Mal would want to believe it was the "real" reality. The dreams would have to be extremely detailed and believable to be that convinced. Since Mal committed suicide to attempt to "wake up" for real, I assume the beginning reality was the "real" one. Do you think Cobb should face murder charges for Mal's death?	vaastaviktaa, jaisa kii humm jaanate hain, kathin hoe sakati haye. yadi koee vaikalpik vaastaviktaa upalabdh hoti joe adhik anandadayak hoti tou main dekh sakata thaa kii mull kahaan vishvaas karna chaahega kii yeh "vaastavik" vaastaviktaa haye. itna aashvast honey key liye sapnon koo behad vistrit aur vishvasaniya honah hoga. choonki mull ney vaastav mein "jaagane" kaa prayas karane key liye aatmahatya curr lii, main maanata huun kii praarambhik vaastaviktaa "vaastavik" thee. kyaa aapako lagata haye kii cob koo maal kii maut key liye hatyaa key aarop kaa saamana karna chaahiye?	hakikath mein toh jeena thoda kasth hein. agar koi alternate reality hein toh maja aatha, muje toh us mal ko reality mein believe hi nahi hota. uska dream toh badi detailed aur believable thi ki koi convinced ho saktha. agar mal suicide karne ka dream aatha jab utne se, toh mein reality par believe karte. kya cobb ko, mals ka murder charges lagane ka faisla thik tha?
Absolutely not, the audience knows the real truth.	bilkul naheen, darshak asli sachchai jaanate hain.	bilkul nahi yar, audience ko sach patha hota hei
I tend to agree.	main sahmat huun.	mein bhi agree karunga
It's a good thing Ariadne had the kick setup for Fischer to wake up.	yeh achchi baat haye kii ariadne key paas fisher koo jagaane key liye kick setup thaa.	yeh sabhi baath hein ki ariadne ko us fisher ne acha kick setup kiya jab wake up hote par
It is a good thing they didn't get trapped.  Memories of a dying parent would be very strong.  Would a new memory like this make you change your life?	achchha huaa kii way fanse naheen.  marate hue maataa-pitaa kii yaaden bahut majboot hongi.  kyaa iss tarah kii koee naee yaad aapka jeevan badal degi?	yeh acchi baat hai ki pakde nahi gaye. marte huye parents ki memories bohot strong hoti hai. kya aise ek nayi memory tumhe apni life change karne par majbor karegi?
I think it would. I would want to honor my dying parents requests. How about you?	mujhe lagata haye aisaa hoga. main apane marate hue maataa-pitaa key anurodh kaa sammaan karna chahunga. aap kaise hain?	mujhe lagta hai ha. mai apne marte huye parents ki iccha zarur puri karunga. tum?
I would too.  Would you stay in a dream forever if it were the reality you loved?	main bhee karunga.  yadi yeh vaha vaastaviktaa hoti jise aap pasand karate tou kyaa aap sadaiv swapn mein hii baney rahate?	mai bhi. kya tum humesha k liye ek dream me rahoge agar tumhe reality pasand ho?
It would certainly be tempting! How odd would it be to know you are in a dream yet you are getting older, living a whole life? Waking up, you'd be much younger then in the dream. Do you think that would make it more difficult to believe that it is the actual reality?	yeh nishchit roop seey aakarshak hoga! yeh jaanana kitna ajib hoga kii aap sapane mein hain, phir bhee aap boodhe hoe rahey hain, poori jindagi jee rahey hain? jaagane parr, aap sapane kii tulana mein bahut chhote honge. kyaa aapako lagata haye kii isase yeh vishvaas karna aur adhik kathin hoe jaayega kii yeh vaastavik vaastaviktaa haye?	bohot tempting hoga wo. tumhe kaisa lagega yeh jaan k ki bhale hi tum ek dream me ho par phir bhi tum age kar rahe aur ek life ji rahe? jab jagoge toh tum bohot young hoge dream me. tumhe lagta hai yeh yakeen karna mushkil hoga, actual reality?
Well, it depends.  I'm growing older right now but I believe this is reality.  I'd certainly be happy to die, but then wake up a younger man!  But I have no difficulty believing this is reality because I don't know any better right now.  If I did know this was a dream I'd be happy to stay here because I'd get to live a whole extra life before my next.  What would you do?	khair yeh nirbhar kartaa haye.  main abhee boodhaa hoe rhaa huun lekin meraa maanana ​​haye kii yeh vaastaviktaa haye.  mujhe nishchit roop seey marane mein khushi hogi, lekin phir ack yuva aadami koo jagaao!  lekin mujhe yeh vishvaas karane mein koee kathinaaee naheen haye kii yeh vaastaviktaa haye kyonki main abhee isase behtar kuchh naheen jaanata.  aggar mujhe pataa hotaa kii yeh ack sapana thaa tou mujhe yahaan rahkar khushi hogi kyonki mujhe apani agali jindagi seey pahale ack poori atirikt jindagi jeene kaa mauka milega.  aap kyaa karenge?	waise, it depends. mai abhi budha ho raha aur mujhe lagta hai yeh reality hai. mujhe waise yeh sahi me accha lagega agar mai maru aur phir se zinda jab hou tab young ho jau! waise mujhe yeh manne me koi pareshaani nahi ki yeh sacchai hai kuiki mujhe isse better kuch pata nahi hai. agar yeh ek sapna hai toh mai yaha rehna chachunga kyuki jab mai jagunga toh mujhe ek extra life jeene ko milegi. tum kya sochate ho?
Honestly, I'm not sure but I think it would make my mind play trick on me. "Wait, I just lived my life. How can I now be in a different one?" It would definitely hard to grasp.	imandari seey kahoon tou, mujhe yakeen naheen haye, lekin mujhe lagata haye kii isase meraa dimag dhokha dene lagega. "ruko, maine abhee-abhee apana jeevan jeeya haye. abb main ack alag jeevan mein kaise reh sakata huun?" ise samajhana nishchit roop seey kathin hoga.	mujhe pata nahi, par mujhe yeh zarur lagta hai ki mera mind itna bada dhokha nahi karega mere saath. "maine ek jeevan jiya. ek aur kaise ji sakta mai?" bohot pareshaani hogi yakeen karne me
What did you think of the spinning top totem?	aapane ghoomane vaale sheersh totem key baare mein kyaa socha?	tum kya sochate ho spinning top totem k baare me?
I thought it was the perfect cinematic device.  The spinning creates so much anticipation for what comes next.  Will it fall over, won't it?  Puts you on the edge of your seat.	mujhe lagaa kii yeh uttam cinemai upkaran haye.  kataai aage kyaa hoga isake liye bahut adhik pratyasha paida karati haye.  kyaa yeh gir jaayega, haye naa?  aapako aapaki seat key kinare parr khadaa curr detaa haye.	mujhe lagta hai wo ek perfect cinematic device hai. jo spinning hai wo itna excitement create karti ki ab next kya hoga. kya hoga agar sab bigad gaya? bohot hi zyada thrill.
What kind of totem do you think you would have?	aap kyaa sochate hain kii aapke paas kiss prakaar kaa kuldevta hoga?	tum kis type ka totem pasand karoge?
I think an eight ball would be exciting and create anticipation.	mujhe lagata haye kii aathh gend romanchak hogi aur pratyasha paida karegi.	mujhe lagta hai eight ball accha hoga aur anticipation create karega

Alright, so a more down to earth super hero movie than some. No super aliens or anything like that?	thheek haye, isaliye yeh kuchh seey bhee adhik vyaavhaarik super hiro film haye. koee super allion yaa aisaa kuchh naheen?	acha, dusre superhero movie se kuch alag hey.. acha tho super aliens ya aur koi ke tarah hei kya?
yeah, I  like superhero films that rely more on technology and skill than superpowers - feels more within the realm of possibility. Critics describe this as having a military thriller feel, as opposed to a stylized comic book frame by frame replay.	haan, mujhe superheiro filmein pasand hain joe mahashaktiyon kii tulana mein praudyogiki aur kaushal parr adhik nirbhar karati hain - sambhavana key dayare mein adhik mahsoos hoti hain. alochakon ney ise ack sainya thriller anubhav key roop mein varnit kiya haye, joe kii ack shaileegat comic book frame darr frame replay key vipareet haye.	haan, muje superhero films pasand hey, kaafi technology aur skill se rely karthe.. lagtha hein ki yeh realm ka possibility hein.. critics tho military thriller ke tarah feel hota jo stylized comic book se opposed tha
no super aliens; grenades, terrorists, and electromagnetic exosuits!	koee super allion naheen; hathgole, aatankvaadi, aur vidyut chumbakiya exosuit!	nahi super aliens; grenades, terrorists aur electromagnetic exosuits
and a hint of romance, too; Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark (Ironman's) potential love interest.	aur romans kaa ack sanket bhee; pepper pots key roop mein gweneth paltro, tonny stark (ironman) kii sambhaavit premika.	thoda romance ka hint bhi tha, Gwyneth paltrow to pepper potts tha aur Tony strak ka potential tho uska interest love hein
This movie has something for everyone! I highly recommend it :)	iss film mein harr kissy key liye kuchh naa kuchh haye! main isaki atyadhik anushansa kartaa huun :)	is movie mein tho sab hein. mein tho yeh recommend jarur karunga
Since it's just called "Iron Man" with no secondary title I'm guessing probably an origin story?	choonki ise kewal "iron maine" kahaa gayaa haye aur iska koee atirikt sheershak naheen haye, main shayed ack mool kahani kaa anuman lagaa rhaa huun?	yeh tho Iron man kaha gaya hein, tho uska secondary title tho pehli story se hi likhi hoga
Good guess! It' s the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, actually.	achchha anuman! yeh vaastav mein marval cinematic universe kii pahali film haye.	acha guess hein! yeh tho pehla film se li gaya hein jo Marvel cinematic universe se
Interesting. Since it's the first how is the budget? Do special effects suffer at all?	dilchasp. choonki yeh pahala haye tou bajat kaisa haye? kyaa vishesh prabhaav bilkul prabhaavit hotey hain?	interesting. tho uska budget kya hein? kya kuch special effects hein is mein?
don't know about the budget - but critical response is that it's an "expansively entertaining special effects extr avaganza"	bajat key baare mein naheen pataa - lekin aalochanatmak pratikriya yeh haye kii yeh "vyaapak roop seey manoranjak vishesh prabhaav vaalaa atirikt bajat" haye.	muje budget nahi patha- lekin is critical response se lag raha hein ki voh expansively entertaining special effects hi hoga
with relatively seamless CGI	apekshaakrit nirbaadh cgi key saath	yeh tho seamless CGI se relate hota
Alright cool. You mentioned Pepper Potts actress; Who else is starring?	thheek haye badhiya # thheek haye shaant raho. aapane pepper pots abhinetri kaa ullekh kiya; aur kaun abhinay curr rhaa haye?	tho cool hein yar. aap tho pepper potts actress ke baare mein kuch bol rahethe, tho kon starr kar raha hein?
Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man; Jeff Bridges as his nemesis, and Terrance Howard as James "Rhodey" Rhodes.	iron maine key roop mein robbert downey junier; jeff bridges unake shatru key roop mein, aur terrence howard james "roady" roads key roop mein.	Robert Downey tho Iron man ka role kiya, aur jeff bridges ne nemesis ka role aur terrance howard ne james rhodey ka role
I don't know James Rhodes. Who is he, in the general scheme of things?	main james roads koo naheen jaanata. cheezon kii samanya yojana mein vaha kaun haye?	muje james rhodes ke baare mein kuch patha nahi., kon hein voh, aur uska general scheme kya hein?
He is a friend of Tony Stark's - he is liaison between Stark Industries and the military, because Lt. Colonel  Rhodes is in the US Air Force in the weapons development / acquisitions dept, and Stark Industries is a defense contractor.	vaha tonny stark kaa mitra haye - vaha stark industries aur senaa key beach sampark kaa kaam kartaa haye, kyonki leftinent curnell roads americi vayu senaa mein hathiyar vikas/adhigrahan vibhaag mein hain, aur stark industries ack raksha thekedaar haye.	Wo Tony Stark ka friend hai - he is liaison between Stark Industries and the military, kyunki  Lt. Colonel Rhodes US Air Force mein hai weapons development / acquisitions dept mein aur Stark Industries is a defense contractor.
What kind of weapons is Stark Industries selling to the air force?	stark industries vayu senaa koo kiss prakaar key hathiyar betch rahee haye?	Stark Industries air force ko kaise weapons bech rahi hai ?

Any last thoughts?	koee antim vichaar?	koi last thoughts?
do you think you'd enjoy it? Do you want to go see it?	kyaa aapako lagata haye kii aap iska anand lenge? kyaa aap ise dekhane jaanaa chaahte hain?	do you think you'd enjoy it? Tum jaa ke dekhna chahte ho?
Definitely. That kind of movie is right up my alley.	nishchit roop seey. usa tarah kii film merey liye bilkul upayukt haye.	Bilkul. Us tarah ki movie is right up my alley.
Just that while critics do vary in response, a 94% rating is pretty decent! A from cinema score and 79/100 on Metacritic	halanki alochakon kii pratikriya alag-alag hoti haye, 94% rating kaafee achchi haye! cinema score seey aii aur metacritic parr 79/100	Jabki critics response mein vary karte hain, 94% rating kafi decent hai! cinema score par A aur Metacritic par 79/100
That is very impressive. Thank you for time!	yeh bahut prabhaavshaali haye. samay dene key liye dhanyavaad!	Ye bohat impressice hai. Time dene ke liye thank you

That one is really good but its really visual	vaha vaastav mein achchha haye lekin vaastav mein drishyamaan haye	ye wali kafi achi hai but kafi visual hai

I feel like they dont make movies like that anymore, like action movies	mujhe aisaa lagata haye kii way abb action filmon jaisi filmein naheen banaate hain	Mujhe lagta hain woh ab iski tarah do not make movies anymore, like action movies.

Hi are you ready to get started? This is a batman vs superman superhero crossover movie. Are you familiar with those superheroes?	namaste kyaa aap aarambh karane key liye taiyar hain? yeh ack batman banaam superman superheiro crossover film haye. kyaa aap una superheiro seey parichit hain?	hi tho aap ready ho? yeh tho batman vs superman superhero ka crossover movie hein.. aap tho superheroes se familiar hi honge?
We are here to discuss Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice	humm yahaan batman banaam superman: donn off justice parr charcha karane key liye aae hain	hum yaha batman vs superman yaani dawn of justice ke baare mein discuss karenge
Yes i am familar with the characters but some of the actors i have never heard of	haan, main paatron seey parichit huun, lekin kuchh abhinetaon key baare mein maine kabhi naheen sunaa haye	haan.. muje characters se familiar hoon lekin kuch actors ko nahi patha hein
I think it sounds like an amazing movie. I love superheroes. I think some of the critics are too harsh. It was a good plot line. I am familiar with Ben Affleck but none of the others.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh ack adbhut film lagati haye. mujhe superheiro bahut pasand hain. mujhe lagata haye kii kuchh aalochak bahut kathor hain. yeh ack achchi kathaanak thee. main bayne affleck seey parichit huun lekin anya kissy seey naheen.	mein kya soch rahi thi ki  yeh amazing movies ke tarah sound kartha.. muje superheroes bahut pasan dhein.. muje lagtha hein ki critics thoda harsh hein.. yeh ache plot line hein.. muje ben affleck se kuch familiar hoon lekin dusra muje nahi patha
I wish they would have used more famous people.	kaash unhone adhik prasiddh logon kaa upayog kiya hotaa.	agar voh aur thoda famous logo ko use kar sakthe they
I would agree though that it was not as good as man of steel. The plot line of that was amazing!	haalaanki main iss baat seey sahmat huun kii yeh steel maine jitna achchha naheen thaa. uska kathaanak adbhut thaa!	mein bhi maantha hoon, ki voh ache nahi hein us man of steel ke tarah.. plot line tho amazing hein
Ben Affleck is the only actor I recognize great plot very harsh critcs	bayne affleck ekmatra aise abhineta hain jinhen main mahaan kathaanak aur kathor alochakon key roop mein pahachaantaa huun	sirf ben affleck hi yek actor jo ache tarah recognize kiya jo harsh critcs se
I agree. I didn't completely understand why Batman and Superman fought though.	main sahmat huun. haalaanki mujhe poori tarah samajh naheen aayaa kii batman aur superman kyon ladey.	mein maantha hoon... muje yeh understand nahi hota ki kyon batman aur superman aapas mein fight karthe
Rotten Tomatoes list it as 27%and average with a 4.9 out of 10. The critcs must be weird. Yeah i couldnt figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad	rotten tomatose ney ise 27% aur 10 mein seey 4.9 key saath ausat key roop mein soochibaddh kiya haye. aalochak ajib honge. haan, main ladaai kaa pataa naheen lagaa sakaa lekin mujhe lagata haye kii aisaa isaliye huaa kyonki superman ney galati seey broose weins key pitaa koo maar daala thaa	rotten tomatoes neh 27% di aur uska average tho 4.9/10 tha... critics tho weird hein... haan, muje bhi is fight ko figure out nahi kar paa raha hoon, lekin kuch samaj aarahi hein ki kyonki superman ko acceidentally bruce wayne ka dad maar daala
I thought it was worth a meteoritic score more than 44. That seemed low! That makes sense. I would be mad if someone tried to kill one of my family members.	maine socha kii yeh 44 seey adhik key ulkapind score key laayak thaa. yeh cumm lugg rhaa thaa! yeh samajh aataa haye. aggar koee merey parivaar key kissy sadasya koo maarne kii koshish karega tou main pagal hoe jaaoonga.	muje laga ki yeh worth meteroitic score 44 ke se upper hein.. lekin low nikla.. mein tho mad hota agar koi mera family ko aise koi maar dethe
hello?	namaste?	hello
Yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of Lex Luthor who just seems to go doown hill the whole movie. I like how the critic talked about Lex (who is supermans arch enemy ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler (who are batmans arch enemies	haan, isamen lakes luther key charitra parr ack anokha spin bhee thaa joe poori film mein bahut hii nirashajanak lagata haye. mujhe pasand aayaa kii aalochak ney lakes (joe superman kaa kattar dushman haye) key baare mein baat kii kyonki usane usaki tulana joker aur riddler (joe batman key kattar dushman hain) seey kii	yeh tho unique spin hey lex luthor ka character ko jo whole movies mein nazar aathe.. muje tho unka bol pasand hein, jaise critic ko lex ke saath bola kyon ki dono aapas me compared kar rahe the ki kon joker aur riddler hein
Then he tops off the crazy part by comparing him to Mark Zuckerburg.	phir vaha maark jukerberg seey tulana karke pagalpan kii hudd taka aage badh jaataa haye.	fir donon compare karthe karthe crazy hote aur mark zuckerburg tak pahun jaathe
Ohh. I liked that too. I like how they always try to biring in the government official s	oh. mujhe vaha bhee pasand aayaa. mujhe pasand haye kii kaise way hamesha sarkari adhikaariyon koo laane kii koshish karate hain	acha.. muje bhi pasand hein.. muje tho voh pasand hein jab government official ko yaha laane ke try kar rahe they
Yeah im still here just slow typer	haan, main abhee bhee yahaan huun, buss dheema typer huun	haan mein yahi hi hoon, mein thoda slow typer hoon
Do you like batman or superman better in the movie?	kyaa aapako film mein batman yaa superman jyada pasand haye?	kya aapko is movie mein batman ya superman pasand hein?
Actually superman	darasal superman	actually superman
How bout u	tumhare baare mein kyaa	thera kya soch hai
I grew up watching the justice league cartoons in thelate 70s and early 80s in which alll the superheros worked together.	main 70 key dashak key anta aur 80 key dashak kii shuruat mein justice leag key cartoon dekhkar badaa huaa huun, jisamen sabhi superheiro ney ack saath kaam kiya thaa.	mai 70 aur 80s ke justice league cartoon ko dekthey huye bada huva hun jis mai sabhi superheros sath me kaam karthe the
I love batman	mujhe batman pasand haye	mujhe batman pasand hai
He is so mysterious	vaha bahut rahasyamay haye	wo bohuth ysterious hai
Sorta ironic that they become enemies	yeh cassie vidambana haye kii way dushman bunn jaate hain	ye ironic hai ki wo dushman ban gaye
Yes he is very mysterious	haan vaha bahut rahasyamay haye	haan wo mysterious hai
It is. Its not what I expected at all	yeh haye. yeh bilkul vaisi naheen haye jisaki mujhe aasha thee	ye hai.  jo maine expect kiya tha who ye nahi hai
I expected more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work together	main avengers kii tarah adhik ummeed kartaa huun jahaan nayakon kaa ack samooh ack saath kaam kartaa haye	main ise kuch avengers ke jaise expect kiya that jis may kuch heroes saath mai kaam karthe hai
I don't really like that they are enimies	mujhe vaastav mein yeh pasand naheen haye kii way dushman hain	way dusman hai ye mujhe bilkul pasand nahi hain
Especially to the point where batman was going to kill superman	visheshkar usa bindu taka jahaan batman superman koo maarne jaa rhaa thaa	khas kar ke jab batman superman ko marne wala tha
Me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent was trying to make bruce wayne and batman look bad thru his news articles	lekh mein kahaa gayaa haye kii maine yaa tou superman ney hii isaki shuruat kii thee, lekin clark kent apane samachar lekhon key jariye broose wein aur batman koo kharab dikhaane kii koshish curr rahey they.	main bhi but superman ne ye starty kiya, article me clark kent bruce wayna aur batman ko bura dikhane ki koshish kar raha hai
You know though to be honest if you look at the way the world is today so full of bad it makesperfect sense in a world view to have them as enemies.	haalaanki, aap jaanate hain kii imandar honey key liye aggar aap dekhein kii duniya aaj itani buri tarah seey bharee hui haye kii duniya kii drishti seey unhein dushman key roop mein rakhna bilkul uchit haye.	tum jaante ho to be honest agar duniya ko aise dekhoge jaise abhi hai to unka dushman hona makes perfect sense
I guess so. They do have polar opposite personalities. One is a humble farm boy and the other is a rich executive	mujhe bhee aisaa hii lagata haye. unake paas dhruviya vipareet vyaktitva hain. ack vinamra kisan ladka haye aur doosara ack ameer kaaryakaari haye	I guess so. Unki bilkul polar opposite personalities hai. Ek to humble farm boy hai dusra ek rich executive
I could see why they clash in that aspect, but I guess I don't imagine them interacting very much in superhero world.	main dekh sakata huun kii way usa pahalu mein kyon takaraate hain, lekin mujhe lagata haye kii main unhein superheiro kii duniya mein bahut adhik baatchit karane kii kalpana naheen kartaa.	Main dekh sakta hu ke us aspect me kyu clash karege but main superhero world me jyada interact karte hue imagine nahi karta.
It says in the 3rd part that at supermans funeral that bruce way e apol9gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman	teesare bhaag mein kahaa gayaa haye kii superman key antim sanskar mein broose wein ney lois laine seey maafi maangate hue kahaa kii vaha superman koo whiffle curr diyaa.	Aisa bolte hai ke 3rd part me superman ke funeral k dauran bruce lois lane se maafi mangta hai ye bolte hue k he failed superman
DUUHHHH well yeah he failed him if he killed him lol	duuhhhh achchha haan, aggar usane usey maar daala tou vaha asafal hoe gayaa hahaha	DUHHHHH well han agar tumne use maar diya matlab you failed him lol
I would feel like if I failed someone if I let them die too. Haha. I like the mysterious dirt levitating though	aggar main kissy koo bhee marane duun tou mujhe aisaa lagega jaise maine kissy koo asafal curr diyaa haye. haaha. haalaanki mujhe udatee hui rahasyamayi gandagi pasand haye	Mujhe bhi aisa lagega k I failed someone agar maine unhe marne diya. haha, mujhe dhool ka  mysterious levitate karna accha laga
Haha	haaha	Haha
Thats what I was thinking	thheek vahee baat merey munn mein aaa rahee thee	Main bhi yahi soch raha hai
Little humor there	vahaan thodaa haasy	Thoda humor waha
Have u seen this movie	kyaa aapane yeh film dekhi haye?	Tumne movie dekhi hai
No have you? is that the end?	naheen aap hain? kyaa yeh anta haye?	No have you? woh end hai kya?
I can't tell	main naheen bataa sakata	bata nahi sakta
Oh yeah. It is.	arey haan. yeh haye.	Arre haan. It is.
I wonder if there will be a sequel	mujhe ashcharya haye kii kyaa koee seekwal hoga	Uska seqeul hoga kya I wonder
Yes watched it 3 times its a tearjerker for me when superman dies	haan, maine ise teen baar dekhaa, jaba superman marr jaataa haye tou yeh merey liye rula dene vaali baat haye	Haan maine teen baar dekhi its a tearjerker for me jab superman marta hai
I feel like good superhero movies need sequels	mujhe lagata haye kii achchi superheiro filmon key seekwal kii jarurat haye	Mujhe lagta hai acchi superhero movies ke sequel hone chahiye
I dunno could be a sequel	mujhe naheen pataa kii iska seekwal bhee bunn sakata haye	Could be a sequel pata nahi mujhe
Like how superman didnt really die he just hibernated til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman	jaise kii superman vaastav mein maraa naheen thaa, vaha taba taka sheetnidra mein padaa rhaa jaba taka usey batman key saath ise thheek karane kaa koee tarika naheen mill gayaa	Jaise superman asliyat mein mara nahi tha usne bas hibernate kiya tha til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman
Hi!	namaste!	hi
Have you seen Real Steel?	kyaa aapane real steel dekhi haye?	kya tumne real steel dekhi
No, haven't seen it. Have you?	naheen, naheen dekhaa. aapke paas?	nahi deki kya tumne dekhi
No i haven't	naheen, maine naheen kiya	nahi maine nahi dekhi
It's a sci-fi movie and i don't typically watch those	yeh ack vigyaan-faaee film haye aur main aam taur parr ise naheen dekhta	yah sci-fi moivehai mai eashi movi pasand nahi karta
Not sure it's that good. It has a score of 59% on Rotten Tomatoes.	yakeen naheen hotaa kii yeh utana achchha haye. rotten tomatose parr iska score 59% haye.	sayad utni achi na ho ,rottten tomatoes ne ieshe 59% score diye hai
That's what I was thinking also	main bhee yahee soch rhaa thaa	mai bhi yahi soch ta hu
Actually, I kind of like sci-fi, but I'm picky.	darasal, mujhe science-fiction pasand haye, lekin main nakchadha huun.	vaise mai sci-fi pasand karta hu lakin mai picky hu
Yes I can agree with that it depends for me	haan, main isase sahmat hoe sakata huun kii yeh merey liye nirbhar kartaa haye	mai isse agree kar sakta hu yah mujh par bhi depend karta hai
This one sounds more like an action flick in a sci-fi setting.	yeh ack vigyaan-faaee setting mein ack action flick kii tarah lagata haye.	ish moive ki sound like action flick jaise hai
ah that would make sense	aaha, iska koee matlab hoga	wah ye yek bat hai
it also has sports?	isamen khel bhee haye?	yeh sports ka hein?
I thought more sci-fi because it was also a twilight zone episode	maine adhik vigyaan-kalpana key baare mein socha kyonki yeh ack twilight zone episode bhee thaa	scifi ka, kyon ki isme twilight zone ka episode bhi hein
But the "Rocky with Robots" line makes me doubt that I would like it.	lekin "rockie ​​vid robots" line seey mujhe sandeh hotaa haye kii main ise pasand karunga.	lekin rocky with robots tho muje doubt hein,
I didnt catch that but I'm with you	main usey samajh naheen paaya lekin main aapke saath huun	muje kuch samaj nahi aaya lekin mein samajne ke koshish karunga
I've never seen any Rocky's either	maine kabhi koee rockie bhee naheen dekhaa	rocky tho mein kahi dekha nahi hein
And I didn't know it was a Twilight Zone episode.	aur mujhe naheen pataa thaa kii yeh twilight zone episode thaa.	aur muje twilight zone episode ke baare mein tho kuch patha nahi hein
Ha! Me neither. Haven't seen the Rocky movies.	haa! naa hii main. rockie filmein naheen dekhin.	muje bhi... rocky movies dekha nahi hey
That's kind of odd to me i feel like most everyone has seen them	yeh merey liye ajib haye, mujhe aisaa lagata haye kii jyadatar sabhi ney unhein dekhaa haye	kuch off hein mere liye... kyon ki agar koi kuch aise puche
The premise of this one is not so stupid though. Robot boxers. I feel it could become real at some point.	haalaanki iska aadhar itna murkhtapurna naheen haye. robot mukkebaaz. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh kissy bindu parr vaastavik bunn sakata haye.	iska premise bhi itna stupid bhi nahi hein, robot tho boxers hein... muje tho real ke tarah feel huva us point mein
Rocky? Yeah I know, it was such a big movie.	chattan kaa? haan, mujhe pataa haye, yeh bahut badee film thee.	rocky? haan muje patha hein, kitna big movie hein
But Stallone has never done anything for me.	lekin stallon ney merey liye kabhi kuchh naheen kiya.	but Stallone ne mere liye kuch nahi kiya.
No kidding I don't like any movies of his	koee mazaak naheen, mujhe unaki koee bhee film pasand naheen haye	mujhe uski koi bhi movie pasand nahi hai
This Real Steel movie has Hugh Jackman in it. He's not b ad.	iss real steel film mein hyu jackman hain. vaha bee vigyaapan naheen haye.	real steel movie mei Hugh Jackman hai.Vah bura nahi hai.
But I don't mind Hugh Jackman	lekin mujhe hyu jackman seey koee furk naheen padata	but mei Hugh Jackman ko bura nahi manata
Haha we're thinking the same thing	haaha humm bhee yahee soch rahey hain	hahaha ham sab ek hee baat ke bare mei soch rahe hai
Exactly. He looks like he has quite a few more IQ points than  Sylvester.	bilkul. aisaa lagata haye kii usake paas sylvester kii tulana mein kuchh adhik iq ank hain.	rahi hai. vo dikha raha hai ki vah shaant hai kuch IQ points mei s=Sylvester
And he's better looking haha	aur vaha behtar dikh rhaa haye haaha	par vash achcha dikha raha hai
Not difficult :-)	mushkil naheen :-)	difficult nahi hai :-)
We're losing track of Real Steel though	haalaanki humm real steel kaa track khou rahey hain	ham Real Steel ke track ko lose kar rahe hai
It sounds as though this is pretty predictable as well and I like movies that I can't guess  the end	aisaa lagata haye jaise yeh bhee kaafee purvaanumaanit haye aur mujhe aisee filmein pasand hain jinake anta kaa main anuman naheen lagaa sakata	Mujhe movie pasand hai jiska end guess nahi kar sakate.uska sound thoda predictable hai
The whole Real Steel story seems like a series of machinations of bad guys against good guys, without much else.	real steel kii poori kahani binaa kissy anya baat key, achche logon key viruddh burey logon kii sajishon kii ack shrinkhala kii tarah lagati haye.	REAL STEEL KA STORY THO SERIES OF MACHINATION US BAD GUYS JO GOOD GUYS SE AGAINS HEIN,
Same here. This one sounds like it's been writ ten by committee.	yahaan bhee aisaa hii. aisaa lagata haye kii yeh samiti dwara duss baar likhaa gayaa haye.	SAME YAR... KUCH COMMITEE KE TARAH SOUNDS KARTHA
Right I do like that it's a a family movie- I don't have kids but I feel like it would be ok for my nephew	sahee haye mujhe yeh pasand haye kii yeh ack parivarik film haye- merey bachche naheen hain lekin mujhe lagata haye kii yeh merey bhatije key liye thheek rahegi	RIGHT, MUJE BHI FAMILY MOVIE DEKHNA PASAND HEIN, MUJE KIDS NAHI HEIN LEKIN MEIN APNI NEPHEW KE SAATH DEKHTHA
I really don't think it's my type of movie.	mujhe sach mein naheen lagata kii yeh merrie tarah kii film haye.	MUJE NAHI LAGTHA KI YEH MERA TYPE KA MOVIE HEIN.
Me either but sometimes it's about the kids and a little boy would like the robots and battles	main bhee, lekin kabhi-kabhi yeh bachchon key baare mein hotaa haye aur ack chhota ladka robot aur ladaaiyon koo pasand karega	MUJE BHI, SOMETIMES MUJE LAGTHA KI YEH KIDS AUR CHOTA BOY KE BAARE MEIN HEIN JO ROTBOTS AUR BATTLES PASAND KARTE
Yeah, maybe it's OK for kids. They like the predictable storylines.	haan, shayed yeh bachchon key liye thheek haye. unhein purvanumeya kahani pasand haye.	HAAN, MAYBE YEH KIDS KE LIYE THO OK HEIN.. PREDICTABLE STORYLINE HEIN
well not "little" but grade school	khair "chhota" naheen balki grade school	WELL, LITTLE THO NAHI LEKIN GRADE SCHOOL
Still... the good guys against bad guys works well at that age.	phir bhee... burey logon key viruddh achche loga usa umr mein achchha kaam karate hain.	STILL. GOOD GUYS THO BAD GUYS SE ACHE TARAH AGAINST KARTHE, JO IS AGE KE LIYE THO ACHE WORK KIYA

I've seen this one before	maine ise pahale bhee dekhaa haye	mein pehele bhi yeh dekha hoon
seems kinda like a typical family-action film with some scifi elements	yeh kuchh sisfi tatvon key saath ack vishisht parivarik-action film kii tarah lagati haye	family action film ke tarah hein thoda scifi elements bhi
was kinda cool tho	haalaanki yeh kaafee achchha thaa	kitna cool hein
Yes it is sort of the family type of film. But I got very much into the characters especially Hugh Jackman's.	haan, yeh ack tarah seey parivarik film haye. lekin main kirdaaron mein bahut gehrai taka ghus gayaa, khaskar hyu jackman key kirdar mein.	haan kuch family type ka film jaise hi hey.. lekin muje unka characters bahut pasand hein especially hugh jackmans ka
was interesting to see Hugh play a more domestic role	hyu koo adhik gharelu bhoomika nibhaate dekhana dilchasp thaa	kya hugs ko domestic role play karne pe interesting hoga
normally he's always a loner fighter type	aam taur parr vaha hamesha ack akela ladaakoo kism kaa hotaa haye	normally voh loner fighter type ke hein
Yes but  he played it well and was able to pull it off.	haan, lekin unhone ise achche seey khela aur ise anjam dene mein safal rahey.	haan, voh ache play kiya hein,
yeah he played the struggle of the character well	haan, unhone kirdar key sangharsh koo achche seey nibhaaya	haan, voh is character se ache struggle kiya hein
I always find it interesting to see what sort of demands actors can get into. I think he fit in with everyone else really well.	mujhe yeh dekhana hamesha dilchasp lagata haye kii abhineta kiss tarah kii maang curr sakate hain. mujhe lagata haye kii vaha harr kissy key saath bahut achche seey ghulmil jaataa haye.	Mujhe always interesting lagta hai dekhne me ki actor ki demands kaha tak pahuch sakti hai. I think wo baki sabhi ke sath badhiya fit hua.
yeah the unusual mix of actors led to a coherent mixture	haan, abhinetaon key asamanya mishran seey ack susangat mishran taiyar huaa	yes actors ka unusual mix ki wajah se coherent mixture ban gaya.
That's definitley true.	yeh nishchit roop seey sach haye.	ye to definitely true hai
I enjoyed seeing all of the different robot fighters in the movie s well.	mujhe film mein sabhi alag-alag robot ladaakoo vimaanon koo dekhkar achchha lagaa.	maine enjoy kiya movie me un sabhi different robot fighters ko bhi
the new paragraph loaded reminds me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an everyday thing in the movie's world	load kiya gayaa nayaa paragraph mujhe yaad dilaata haye kii yeh tathya kitna dilchasp haye kii yeye robot film kii duniya mein rosemarra kii cheej they	jo paragraph load hu usne mujhe remind karaya ki ki ye kitna interesting factor tha movie me ki ye robots us movie world me everyday object the..
like he's just a lower-class dude but he owns a fighting robot	jaise kii vaha sirf ack nichale darje kaa aadami haye lekin usake paas ack ladaakoo robot haye	like wo just ek  lower class dude tha but wo ek fighting robot own karta hai.
Yeah seeing the draw of their world and how these robots are just sort of common was something that I really liked as well.	haan, unaki duniya key aakarshan koo dekhana aur yeye robot kiss tarah seey aam hain, yeh kuchh aisaa thaa joe mujhe bhee vaastav mein pasand aayaa.	Yes unki duniya ka atmosphere dekh ke ki kaise ye robots just common thing hai, yah sach me wo factor tha jo mujhe bhi bahut pasand aaya.
I thought about what it would be like to really live in that world	maine socha kii vaastav mein usa duniya mein rehna kaisa hoga	I thought about ki really us world me rahne me kaisa lagta hoga
also interesting how it brings up the point that improved technology doesn't make all problems go away	yeh bhee dilchasp haye kii yeh iss baat koo kaise saamane laataa haye kii behtar takneek seey sabhi samasyaaen door naheen hoe jaatin	also ye bhi interesting point tha ki kaise sirf improved technology is duniya ki saari problems ko whisk away nahi kar sakti.
this guy still is in debt and so on	yeh aadami abhee bhee curz mein duba huaa haye ityaadi	ye guy still debt me tha aur so on
Yes no matter what we have basic life issues will never really change. They'll just come about in a new way.	haan, isase koee fark naheen padata kii hamaare jeevan key buniyaadi mudde vaastav mein kabhi naheen badalenge. way buss ack nae tareeke seey saamane aaenge.	KUCH BHI HO, LEKIN LIFE ISSUES KO KABHI CHANGE NAHI HOTE.. VOH KAHI NEW WAY MEIN AA HI JAATHA
that was a pretty good scene (the new paragraph)	vaha bahut achchha drishya thaa (nayaa paragraph)	KAAFI ACHE SCENE HEIN IS NEW PARAGRAPH MEIN
kind of hinted at things remaining worse for the guy/son but eventually they fought their way back	ladke/bete key liye cheejen badatar rahane kaa sanket diyaa gayaa thaa, lekin antatah unhone vaapsee kii ladaai ladee	HINT KE TARAH HEIN, KUCH GUY KA YAAD AATHA JO EVENTUALLY AAPAS MEIN FOUGHT KIYE THE
cool to see the human spirit reflected in robots	robot mein maanviya bhavna koo pratibimbit hotey dekhana achchha lagata haye	COOL HE US ROBOTS KO HUMAN SPIRIT SE DEKHNE KA
Oh yeah lol I remember that...	oh haan haaha mujhe vaha yaad haye...	HAAN YAR, MUJE BHI YAAD HEIN
It's just the classic underdog story told in a somewhat different way. There will always be trials and triumphs	yeh kuchh alag tareeke seey bataai gaee classic dalit kahani haye. pareekshan aur vijay sadaiv rahengi	YEH THO CLASSIC UNDERDOG STORY JO DIFFERENT WAY MEIN KAHA GAYA HEIN.. TRIALS AUR TRIUMPHS THO AATHE JAATHE HEIN
As long as humans are around we'll never really intrinsically change .	jaba taka manushya hamaare aspas hain taba taka humm vaastav mein kabhi bhee aantarik roop seey naheen badalenge.	JAB TAK HUMANS AAPAS MEIN AATHE TAB TAK HUM KABHI INTRINSICALLY CHANGE NAHI KARTE
yeah the robots don't change the human life, they just augment it	haan, robot maanav jeevan koo badalate naheen hain, way buss ise badhaate hain	HAAN, ROBOTS THO HUMAN LIFE KO NAHI CHANGE KARTE, YEH SIRF AUGMENT HI HEY
nothing intrinsic is lost	kuchh bhee aantarik naheen khoya haye	INTRINSIC THO KUCH NAHI HEIN
Right. I suppose in many ways we were really supposed to see the robots as humans - more so than the actual humans. That's a really  interesting concept, I think.	sahee. meraa maanana ​​haye kii kaee mayanon mein hamein vaastav mein roboton koo insanon key roop mein dekhana chaahiye thaa - vaastavik insanon seey kaheen adhik. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh vaastav mein ack dilchasp avadharana haye.	SAHI HEI, KAHI LOG THO ROBOTS KO HUMAN KE TARAH DEKHNE LAGTHE LEKIN ACTUAL HUMANS THO BEHETAR HEIN.. REALLY INTERESTING CONCEPT HEIN YAR
kinda reminds me of virtual reality	yeh mujhe aabhaasi vaastaviktaa kii yaad dilaata haye	virtual reality ka yaad aaya
humanity lives on but through the robots	manavata jeevit haye lekin robot key madhyam seey	humanity tho jinda rahega, lekin robots
even though the robots are doing the action their action is still fully human	bhale hii robot kaarravaai curr rahey hain lekin unaki kaarravaai abhee bhee poori tarah seey maanviya haye	robots kitna bhi kaam karega, lekin lagtha tho human ki tarah hi
Yeah that's very true. I would love it if someday we could really have virtual reality like that. It would be so much fun to be able to really feel like you're a super hero!	haan yeh bilkul sach haye. mujhe bahut achchha lagega aggar kissy dinn hamaare paas vaastav mein aisee aabhaasi vaastaviktaa hoe. vaastav mein yeh mahsoos karna bahut mazedaar hoga kii aap ack super hiro hain!	haan voh tho sach hein... ab tho nahi lekin jarur yek din muje pasand aayaga.. super hero ke tarah feel karna tho fun hein
yeah, you'd have the thrill of a suernatural existence without losing your humanity	haan, aapako apani manavata khoye binaa ack alaukik astitva kaa romanch milega	haan, kya aapko supernatural existence ka thrill hein, humanity ko lose kare bina
i think that's a nice message the film has	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh film ack achchha sandesh haye	muje lagtha hein ki, yeh ache message hein is film ka
Right that is very true. We're all interconnected in this world somehow. Even if some people do have  more than others.	sahee haye yeh bilkul sach haye. humm sabhi iss duniya mein kissy naa kissy tarah ack dusare seey judey hue hain. bhale hii kuchh logon key paas doosaron seey adhik hoe.	haan. sabhi is world ko interconnected hein.. even kuch people dusron ke saath

Cumberbach does a great job acting.	comberback bahut achchha abhinay karate hain.	kamal ki acting ki hai Cumberbach ne.
These storys based on true stories tend to always add so much stuff to keep it interesting that it kinda distorts history in my opinion.	sachchi kahaaniyon parr adharit yeye kahaaniyan hamesha dilchasp banaae rakhane key liye itani saaree cheezen jodd detee hain kii merrie raay mein yeh itihas koo vikrit curr detee hain.	mere opinion me true stories pe based ye story hamesha history ko distort karti hain use interesting banane ke liye.
The bit about getting married to Keira Knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting.

It is interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a book based on his life. I see your point there.	yeh dilchasp haye kyonki yeh film unake jeevan parr adharit ack kitab parr adharit naatak parr adharit haye. main vahaan aapaki baat dekhta huun.	interesting baat ye hai ki yah movie us play par based hai, jo uski life par likhi book par based hai. tumhara point dekh sakta hu mai.
I would probably enjoy the technical aspects of the film, the good acting, and even the half made up story!	main shayed film key takniki pahaluon, achche abhinay aur yahaan taka ​​kii aadhi-adhuri kahani kaa anand loonga!	mai probably film ke technical aspect ko enjoy karu, badhiya acting, aur half cooked story.
I think also where it is a movie about a mathematician, it kind of helps to add in some plot elements. I think this is unusual though as his life was so interesting.	mujhe yeh bhee lagata haye kii jahaan yeh ack ganitagya key baare mein film haye, vahaan yeh kuchh kathaanak tatvon koo jodane mein madad karati haye. haalaanki mujhe lagata haye kii yeh asamanya haye kyonki unaka jeevan bahut dilchasp thaa.	I think also yah movie ek mathematician ke baare men hai, plot me thode elements dalna helpful hai. par mujhe ye unusual laga kyonki uski life to waise hi itni interesting hai.
There is quite a bit of espionage involved as well. I suppose I am not spoiling it since it is history, but there is some Russian collusion involved.	isamen kaafee matra mein jasusi bhee shamil haye. meraa maanana ​​haye kii main ise kharab naheen curr rhaa huun kyonki yeh itihas haye, lekin isamen kuchh russie milibhagat shamil haye.	isme espionage ka angle bhi involve hai. I suppose mai  kuch spoil nahi kar raha hu kyonki ye history hai, but kuch Russian secret bhi involved hai.

It is not so bad though.	haan, aapako kamuk romans key madhyam seey teji seey aage badhana parh sakata haye. haalaanki yeye itna buraa naheen haye.	haan, aapako phurteela romaans ke maadhyam se aage badhana hoga. yah haalaanki itana bura nahin hai.

I didn't really get that part, but who can understand the gays?	mujhe vaastav mein vaha hissa naheen milaa, lekin samlaingikon koo kaun samajh sakata haye?	mujhe vaastav mein vah hissa nahin mila, lekin samalaingikon ko kaun samajh sakata hai?
Well, that kinda of makes it more inviting to me, Keira Nightly must be sad to find that out!	khair, yeh baat ise merey liye aur adhik aakarshak banaati haye, keira nightly koo yeh jaankar dukh huaa hoga!	khair, yah thode ise aur adhik mere lie aamantrit karata hai, keira naitalee ko yah pata lagaane ke lie dukhee hona chaahie!
yeah I think she was pretty upset. Like I said I didn't really understand all of that. I was mostly in it for the math. What an interesting, fascinating story.	haan, mujhe lagata haye kii vaha kaafee pareshan thee. jaisa kii maine kahaa, main vaastav mein vaha sub samajh naheen paaya. main jyadatar ganit key liye isamen thaa. kitni dilchasp, dilchasp kahani haye.	haan, mujhe lagata hai ki vah bahut pareshaan thee. jaisa mainne kaha ki main vaastav mein us sab ko samajh nahin paaya hoon. main jyaadaatar ganit ke lie isamen tha. kya dilachasp, aakarshak kahaanee hai.
I think Turing was gay for his mentor or something, but he dies.	mujhe lagata haye kii turing apane guru yaa kissy anya kaaran seey samalaingik thaa, lekin usaki mrityu hoe gaee.	mujhe lagata hai ki tyooring apane guru ya kuchh aur ke lie samalaingik tha, lekin vah mar jaata hai.
Sounds a bit like Beautiful mind that was a great movie, too!	kuchh-kuchh beautiful mind jaisa lagata haye, vaha bhee ack behtareen film thee!	sundar dimaag kee tarah lagata hai ki ek mahaan philm thee, bhee!

Talk about changing the story!	kahani badalane kii baat karo!	story badalne ke baare main batao!
Turing's story is pretty sad. He got bullied a lot at boarding school. Seems to have affected him a lot. Too bad he wasn't able to find love. Maybe he should have gone for somebody besides Kiera Knightley!	turing kii kahani bahut dukhad haye. boarding school mein unhein bahut pareshan kiya gayaa. lagata haye usa parr bahut assar padaa haye. bahut buraa huaa kii usey pyaar naheen mill paaya. shayed usey keeraa nightly key alawa kissy aur key liye jaanaa chaahiye thaa!	Turing ki story bahut sad hai. usko boarding school main bahut bully kia gaya.Lagta hai woh bahut affect hua. Too bad use love nahin mila. Maybe use Kiera Knightley ke alava kisi aur ko jaana chahiye tha!
How come you dislike her so much?	aap usey itna napsand kaise karate hain?	kaise tum use itna dislike kar sakte ho?
Is it because you guys used to date?	kyaa aisaa isaliye haye kyonki aap loga dett karate they?	kya isliye ki tum log dating karte the?

I find her Wiry, trite, and egotistical. I only enjoy those qualities in myself.	mujhe vaha ajib, ghisi-pitty aur ahankari lagati haye. main kewal apane aap mein una gunon kaa anand letaa huun.	mujhe woh Wiry,trite aur egotistical laga. Mujhe sirf who qualities apne mein lagta hai.
I know there is that song by celine dion.	main jaanata huun kii selene dione kaa vaha gaanaa haye.	mujhe malum hai woh song celine dion se hai.
haha that is funny. I figured that but didn't want to say.	haaha yeh hasyaspad haye. mujhe yeh samajh mein aayaa lekin main kahana naheen chaahata thaa.	Ha Bahut hi majedar hai. Hum ko malum tha ki bat karna nahi chahete
She is kind of a walking plattitude. Kind of like Reese Witherspoon, but more indiana less texas	vaha ack tarah seey chalane firane vaali mahila haye. reez vidaraspoon kii tarah, lekin texas cumm indiana adhik	Woh ladki chalne wali sadharan hai. Reese Witherspoon ki tarah, lekin jyada indiana aur kum Texas
or something	yaa kuchh aur	ya kuch kuch
Oh, its ok. Im not blind. However after looking at Keira Knightley for 2 hours i might be.	oh, yeh thheek haye. main naheen banaaya gayaa huun. haalaanki 2 ghante taka keira nightly koo dekhane key baad shayed main aisaa curr paauunga.	Arey teek hai. Hum andha nahi hai. Lekin do ghante tak hum Keira Knightly ko dekhne ke badh,  ho sakta hai
Still the story sounds like one of importance that should be told, ill have to tune in.	phir bhee yeh kahani ack mahatvapurna kahani lagati haye jise bataaya jaanaa chaahiye, mujhe isamen shamil honah padegaa.	Phir bhi is kahani aisa mahatwa lagta hai ki sabhi ko batana chahiye. Humko sunna padega.
anyways she didn't ruin the movie. If anything, Turing's life ruins the movie. It's just sad he gets bullied and takes refuge in gay love. He could have just worked out, made some friends, and been happy. It is a very important story. Reminds me of the life of Charles Darwin, or Plato.	vaise bhee usane film koo barbad naheen kiya. kuchh bhee hoe, turing kaa jeevan film koo barbad curr detaa haye. yeh bahut dukhad haye kii usey dhamkaya jaataa haye aur vaha samalaingik prem kii sharan letaa haye. vaha buss kaam curr sakata thaa, kuchh dost banaa sakata thaa aur khush reh sakata thaa. yeh ack bahut hii mahatvapurna kahani haye. mujhe charles darwin yaa plato key jeevan kii yaad aatee haye.	Vise bhi usne philam ko barbad nahi kiya. Turing ka jeevan film ko barbad kar deta hai. Bahut dukh ki bat hai ki voh tung agaya aur sam legik prem ka sharan leta hai. Woh kam kar sakta tha, kuch dost bana sakta tha, aur khush reha sakta tha. Yeh to ek bahut hi mahatpurna kahani hai. Charles Darwin ya Plato ka yad dilata hai.
oh, I really like Reese, Not sure what that says about me.	oh, mujhe sachmuch reez pasand haye, nishchit naheen kii vaha merey baare mein kyaa kahata haye.	Arre, mujhe vastavme Reez pasand hai, lakin woh mere bare me kya bolta hai malum nahi hai
That is funny but you don't like Kiera.	yeh hasyaspad haye lekin aapako kiara pasand naheen haye.	Yeh majak ki bat hai lekin apko Kiera pasand nahi hai.
I thought Cumberbach made a great Turing, but it would have been funnier if they cast eminem.	maine socha kii comberback ney ack mahaan turing banaai haye, lekin aggar way eminem koo cast karate tou yeh adhik majedar hotaa.	Mujhe laga ki Cumberbakh ne ek mahan turing banaya hai agar woh eminem dalte hai to aur hi majedar hota.
Fitness is very important. Im a big fan of Darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story.	fitness bahut jaruri haye. main darwin kaa bahut badaa prashansak huun, isaliye kahani mein merrie dilchaspi thodi aur badh gaee haye.	Fitness bahut jaruri hai. Mi Darwin ka bada prasanshak hai jise mujhe kahani me aur dilchaspi huyi.
Well, Darwin had a rough time on the beagle. He was the captain's special steward, which was a demanding job, if you know what I mean.	khair, darwin koo beagle key mamle mein kathin samay kaa saamana karna padaa. vaha kaptan kaa vishesh prabandhak thaa, joe ack kathin kaam thaa, yadi aap jaanate hain kii meraa kyaa matlab haye.	badiya, darwin ka bura time tha beagle par. Wo captain ka special steward tha, jo ki ek demanding job thi, agar tum jante ho ki mera kya matlab he
All of the Hollywood rags seemed to speak highly of it.	aisaa prateet hotaa haye kii hollywood key sabhi diggaj isake baare mein atyadhik baat curr rahey hain.	Hollywood ke sare newspaper uski badi badi karte dikhai dete hain
His theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the captain and his station in life, and his feeling of evolution to a higher station in his own life. He was certainly an interesting fellow.	fitness kaa unaka siddhant mool roop seey kaptan aur jeevan mein unake sthaan key saath unake sambandh aur apane jeevan mein ack uchch sthaan parr vikas kii unaki bhavna kaa ack saadrishya thaa. vaha nishchit roop seey ack dilchasp vyakti thaa.	Uski theory darasal ek analogy thi uski captain and station ke life ke liye, or uski apni life main evolution to a higher station ke feeling ke liye. Wo waqai ek interesting admi tha
I seriously loved this Turing movie. You have to see it!!!	mujhe yeh turing film bahut pasand aaee. aapako ise dekhana chaahiye!!!	seriously mujhe Turing movie pasand ayi. Tumhain dekhni hogi
I dont usually take anything the Hollywood reporter says to heart though.	haalaanki, main aamtaur parr hollywood reporter kii kissy bhee baat koo dill seey naheen letaa.	halanki main dil par nahin leta jobhi hollywood ke reporter ne kaha

Turing is an important guy. I'd rather see a movie about Kurt Godel or Giordano Bruno.	turing ack mahatvapurna vyakti haye. main curt godel yaa giordano bruno key baare mein ack film dekhana pasand karunga.	Turing ek important admi he. Main iske bajae kurl Godel ya giordano bruno ki movie dekhunga
Or maybe a serious horror/drama about Galileo.	yaa shayed galileo key baare mein ack gambhir daravani/naatak.	or shayad Galileo ke bare main serious horror/drama

I actually think I might write a script about the life of Galileo	main vaastav mein sochata huun kii main galileo key jeevan key baare mein ack patkatha likh ​​sakata huun	me actually sochta hu ki mujhe Galileo ki life ke bare me ek script likhna chahiye
Your right, because Scientifically The Big Lebowski is the best movie ever made. yet, magazines like empire and Variety pee'd on its rug.	aapka adhikaar, kyonki vaigyaanik roop seey dha bigg lebowski abb taka bunny sarvshreshth film haye. phir bhee, empire aur variety jaisi patrikaaen isake galiche parr peshab curr rahee theen.	tum right ho, kyunki scientifically big Lebowski aaj tak banayi gayi  best film he. iske bawajood, Empire aur Variety jaisi magazines iski apman janak alochna karti he.
people would love that it would make them feel smart.	logon koo achchha lagega kii isase unhein smart honey kaa ehsas hoga.	people pasand karenge ki ye unhe smart feel karayega.

I will for sure check it out on the myface.	main nishchit roop seey ise apane chehare parr janchunga.	main nishchit roop se ise myfachai par dekhoonga.

Yes, sorry for the delay. I did see the movi e recently. I don't usually enjoy political films, but I thought it was quite well done.	haan, deree key liye khed haye. maine haal hii mein film dekhi. main aamtaur parr raajneetik filmon kaa anand naheen letaa, lekin mujhe lagaa kii yeh kaafee achchi bunny hain.	ha ,maf karna maine abhi vah moive dekhi vaise me political base moive pasand nahi karta but ye kafi achhi thi
No worries.  Oh, yeah, I thought Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks were both pretty good.	koee chinta naheen.  oh, haan, mujhe lagaa kii maryl streep aur tomm hanks donon bahut achche they.	koi nahi oh muje lagta hai Maeryl Steep AUR tOM hANKS DONO BRIYA HAI
So, it apparently has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 88%, which surprises me because, like you said, most people don't seem to go for political thrillers.	tou, jahir taur parr isaki rotten tomatose rating 88% haye, joe mujhe aashcharyachakit karati haye kyonki, jaisa kii aapane kahaa, adhikansh loga raajneetik thriller key liye naheen jaate hain.	jaise rotten tomatoes ne ise 88% ki rating di mai surprised hu kayoki jayda log political thrillers nahi dekte
I think it has a lot to do with the cast, to be honest. Meryl and Tom and Sarah Paulson as well. If they didn't get those larger names, more people would have ignored it.	imandari seey kahoon tou mujhe lagata haye kii iska kalakaron key saath bahut kuchh lena-denaa haye. maryl aur tomm aur saaraa paulson bhee. yadi unhein way badey naam naheen milate, tou adhik loga ise andekha curr dete.	muje lagta hai cast ne kafi  acha kiya hai jaise meryl ,tom,aur sarah ,agar unke naam itne bare nahi hote to log unhe ignor kar dete
I'm looking to see who Sarah Paulson played. I saw it too...	main yeh dekhana chaah rhaa huun kii saaraa paulson ney kaun khela haye. maine bhee dekhaa...	mai dekhna chahuga sarah paulson kaun play karta hai mai bhi
Oh, she was Tony!	oh, vaha tonny thee!	ACHA THO TONY HEIN VOH
It's described as an American historical thriller, which I guess I agree with, given the nature of the Pentagon Papers.	ise ack americi aitihaasik thriller key roop mein varnit kiya gayaa haye, pentagon pappers kii prakriti koo dekhate hue, mujhe lagata haye kii main isase sahmat huun.	AMERICAN HISTORICAL THRILLER SE DESCRIBED KIYA HEIN, JO MUJE GUESS KI VOH NATURE KA PENTAGON PAPERS DIYA HOGA
I didn't realize it was directed by Steven Spielberg.	mujhe naheen pataa thaa kii iska nirdeshan steven spielberg ney kiya haye.	MUJE REALIZE HI NAHI HOTA KI STEVEN SPIELBERG NE DIRECT KIYA HAIN
I feel like the struggle between the media and the people in power is always relevent	mujhe aisaa lagata haye kii media aur sattaa mein baithe logon key beach sangharsh hamesha praasangik rahata haye	MUJE FEEL HOTA KI YEK POWER KELIYE MEDIA AUR PEOPLE DONO STRUGGLE KARTE JO RELEVANT HEIN
Yeah. It was interesting to see how the court case played out and how the newspapers sort of stood together.	haan. yeh dekhana dilchasp thaa kii adalati mamla kiss tarah chalaa aur akhbar kiss tarah ack saath khade hue.	HAAN.. KAAFI INTERESTING HEIN, JAISE KAISE COURTCASE NE PLAYED OUT KIYA AUR KAISE NEWSPAPER NE US STOOD KO AAPAS MEIN SORT OUT KIYA
Matthew Rhys was in it too...I like him as an actor.	isamen maithyu rais bhee they...ack abhineta key roop mein main unhein pasand kartaa huun.	MATTHEW RHYS BHI THEY.. MUJE UNHE PASAND HEIN
Critics seemed to be torn about the movie..	aisaa lugg rhaa thaa kii aalochak film koo laker naaraaz hain.	IS MOVIE MEIN THO TORN HI BEHETAR CRITICS SE SAATH
One said, "The Post passes the trickiest tests of a historical drama...	ack ney kahaa, "dha post ack aitihaasik naatak key sabse kathin parikshanon seey guzarta haye...	YEK KAHA KI," IS POST THO TRICKIEST TEST PASSE HUVA HEI IS HISTORICAL DRAMA MEIN..
Another said, "is too calculated to reflect today's ragged, tenuous sociopolitical climate."	ack anya ney kahaa, "aaj key toote-foote, kamjor samajik-raajneetik mahaul koo pratibimbit karane key liye yeh bahut adhik ganana yogya haye."	DUSRA KAHA KI,"AAJKAL KA RAGGED THO THODA REFLECT HEIN CALCULATE KARNE PE, TENUOUS SOCIOPOLITICAL CLIMATE."
Do you think you would see it again?	kyaa aapako lagata haye kii aap ise dobara dekhenge?	KYA AAP DUBARA DEKHNE KO PASAND KARENGE?
I I think seeing it a second time would be helpful to pick up the little things I might have missed. I'm not sure I would categorize it as calculated. It was intense, but I thought in a good way.	mujhe lagata haye kii ise doosari baar dekhane seey una chhoti-chhoti cheejon koo samajhane mein madad milegi joe shayed mujhase chhoot gaee houn. mujhe yakeen naheen haye kii main ise ganana key roop mein vargeekrit karunga. yeh teevr thaa, lekin maine achche tareeke seey socha.	mujhe lagata hai ki yah doosaree baar dekhane se madad milegee jo mainne yaad kiya ho sakata hai chhotee cheejon ko lene ke lie. mujhe yakeen nahin hai ki main ise ganana ke roop mein vargeekrt karoonga. yah teevr tha, lekin mainne achchhe tareeke se socha.

Meryl Streep for sure. being the first female publisher  of a major news source, it was really amazing to see her part in the struggle and how it was unique to that role	nishchit roop seey maryl streep. ack pramukh samachar srot kii pahali mahila prakaashak honey key naate, sangharsh mein unaki bhoomika koo dekhana vaastav mein aashcharyajanak thaa aur yeh usa bhoomika key liye kitna advitiya thaa	meril streep ke lie sunishchit karen. ek pramukh samaachaar srot kee pahalee mahila prakaashak hone ke naate, sangharsh mein apane hisse ko dekhana vaastav mein aashcharyajanak tha aur us bhoomika ke lie yah kaise adviteey tha
Yeah there were some moments in the movie for sure.	haan, film mein kuchh kshan avashya they.	Hnji, movie main kuch moment jaroor honge
I didn't realize the employee who leaked the papers had worked at the RAND corporation.	mujhe iss baat kaa ehsas naheen thaa kii pepper leak karane vaalaa karmchari rand corporation mein kaam curr chuka thaa.	mujhe is baat ka ehasaas nahin tha ki kaagajaat leek karane vaale karmachaaree ne rand korporeshan mein kaam kiya tha.

I didn't really understand why the Rand employee had leaked the info in the first place.

O r rather did you catch why? I feel like I must have missed something.	yaa balki aapane pakad liya kyon? mujhe aisaa lugg rhaa haye jaise mujhase kuchh chhoot gayaa hoga.	o aar balki tumane pakada kyon? mujhe aisa lag raha hai ki mujhe kuchh yaad aa gaya hoga.
No, I think he was just disenchanted with the war and how we had escalated our involvement.	naheen, mujhe lagata haye kii vaha sirf yuddh seey nirash thaa aur hamane apani bhagidari kaise badhaa dee thee.	nahin, mujhe lagata hai ki vah yuddh se vimukh tha aur hamane apanee bhaageedaaree ko kaise badhaaya tha.
Apparently Ellsberg overheard Robert McNamara saying he thought the war was hopeless, even though he was telling the public it was going well, and he became disillusioned about that and decided to leak the truth.	jahira taur parr ellsberg ney robbert mcnamara koo yeh kahate hue sunaa kii unhein lagata haye kii yuddh nirashajanak haye, bhale hii vaha janata koo bataa rahey they kii sub kuchh thheek chala rhaa haye, aur iss baare mein unaka mohbhang hoe gayaa aur unhone sachchai koo leak karane kaa faisala kiya.	ellsberg tho robert mcnamara se bol raha tha ki yeh war hopeless hein, even though voh voh public ke saath bole ki yeh ache jaayega aur voh disillusioned ban gaye aur truth leak karne ke decide kiya
(It was YEARS LATER that he actually decided to leak the info)	(varshon baad usane vaastav mein jaankaari leak karane kaa nirnay liya)	haan, kahi saal ke baat voh  truth karne ko leak kiya
That was a plot detail I definitely missed. Must have been an early scene in the movie.	vaha ack kathaanak kaa vivaran thaa jise main nishchit roop seey bhool gayaa. film kaa koee shuruati drishya rhaa hoga.	voh plot detail tho mein definitely missed karunga.. is movie mein early scene honge
Oh, you're right! I forgot that he had overheard that conversation. I'm glad Tom Hank's character was able to figure out it was he who had  leaked the info, and got all of the information he needed for the Post.	oh, tum sahee hoe! main bhool gayaa kii usane vaha baatchit sunee thee. mujhe khushi haye kii tomm hank kaa charitra yeh pataa lagaane mein saksham thaa kii usane hii jaankaari leak kii thee, aur usey post key liye aavashyak sabhi jaankaari mill gaee.	oh tho sahi hein! muje tho bhool hi gaya ki voh overheard hein is conversation mein.. muje khus hein ki Tom hank's ka character figure out kar sakthe aur info ko leaked huva aur saari info jo unhe post karne ko soch
Yeah it was interesting how that developed. Do you remember how the legal issues developed? It says something about the paper's source being the same as the NYT's source. I had forgotten the NYT published something first.	haan, yeh dilchasp thaa kii yeh kaise vikasit huaa. kyaa aapako yaad haye kii kanuni mudde kaise vikasit hue? yeh pepper key srot key nyt key srot key samaan honey key baare mein kuchh kahata haye. main bhool gayaa thaa kii nyt ney pahale kuchh prakaashit kiya thaa.	haan, yeh interesting hein jo developed hein.. kya aap ko yaad hein ki kaise legal issues developed huva? yeh kuch paper's source ke baare mein hein jo NYT ka source bhi hein... muje NYT ka publish tho bhool hi gaya
Yeah having the same source put Graham possibly  in contempt of court.	haan, vahee srot honey seey graham sambhavatah adalat kii avamaanana ​​mein parh gayaa.	haan, same source se rahana, graham ko possibly us contempt ka court
Do you think Graham made the right choice to publish?	kyaa aapako lagata haye kii graham ney prakaashan kaa sahee vikalp chunaa?	kya aap sochte graham publish karne ka right choice hein?
I'm a little torn, but, given the seriousness of the issue, yes. Normally I would tend to side with the government, but this was really mismanaged. It was an important decision for the court to side with the paper.	main thodaa pareshan huun, lekin, mudde kii gambhirta koo dekhate hue, haan. aam taur parr main sarkaar kaa paksh letaa huun, lekin yeh vaastav mein kuprabandhit thaa. adalat key liye akhbar kaa paksh lena ack mahatvapurna nirnay thaa.	mein tho thoda torn, lekin yeh seriousness issue hein... haan... normally, mein tho government ka side hon, lekin voh mismanaged hein.. yeh tho unka important decision hein court ka us paper ko side rakhna

Here is a question for you - would you recommend this movie to people you know (who haven't seen it)?	yahaan aapke liye ack prashn haye - kyaa aap iss film kii anushansa una logon koo karenge jinhen aap jaanate hain (jinhone ise naheen dekhaa haye)?	aap ke liye yek question- kya aap is movie ko recommend karenge?
I would recommend it for sure to most people. despite it taking place int he 70's, I feel Spielberg took it in a really exciting direction instead of just throwing facts at you about the case.	main nishchit roop seey adhikansh logon koo isaki anushansa karunga. isake bavjood kii yeh 70 key dashak mein hoe rhaa thaa, mujhe lagata haye kii spielberg ney mamle key baare mein kewal tathya aap parr fenkane key bajaay ise vaastav mein romanchak disha mein leey liya.	mai isse jayada logo ko recommand karta hu,bavjud he place 70,muje lagta hai spoelberg exciting hai
I think it was filmed well, and I was surprised how much suspense built even though I already knew the basic facts.	mujhe lagata haye kii ise achchi tarah seey filmaya gayaa thaa, aur mujhe ashcharya huaa kii kitna suspense banaa, jabaki main pahale seey hii buniyaadi tathyon koo jaanata thaa.	yah ek achi film thi ,mai surprised hu itne jayada suspense the jabki mai sare fact janta ta
There were so many details I had no idea about. And I like how it sort of set the stage for the Watergate scandal right afterwards with Nixon.	aise bahut seey vivaran they jinake baare mein mujhe koee jaankaari naheen thee. aur mujhe yeh pasand haye kii kaise isane nixon key thheek baad watergate ghotale key liye munch taiyar kiya.	isme itne sare detail the muje idea nahi tha,aur muje pasant aya watergate scandal nixon ke saath
I completely forgot about that scene at the end! Just got some details for the movie summary, and it mentions that. I guess that was one year later.	anta mein main usa drishya key baare mein poori tarah seey bhool gayaa! abhee film saransh key liye kuchh vivaran mille hain, aur isamen iska ullekh haye. mujhe lagata haye kii vaha ack saal baad thaa.	mai ant ka seen bilkul bhul gayamoive ki summary milne par laga yah yek saal bad
What did you think of the part when the case  went to the Supreme Court?	jaba mamla supreme court mein gayaa tou aapane usa hisse key baare mein kyaa socha?	jab case superme court me tha us part ke bare me kya socha
Honestly, I really liked all of the scenes with Jesse Plemons as the lawyer. I thought he nailed it as far as lawyers taking a straight line even when something outside the box comes up. I wondered if the lines he spoke were based on facts and actual testimony.	imandari seey kahoon tou, mujhe vakeel key roop mein jessy pellemans key sabhi drishya bahut pasand aae. mujhe lagaa kii jahaan taka ​​leak seey hatkar kuchh saamane aaney parr bhee vakeelon dwara seedhi rekha apanaane kii baat haye tou unhone ise bakhubi nibhaaya haye. mujhe ashcharya huaa kii kyaa unhone joe panktiyaan bolin way tathyon aur vaastavik gawahi parr adharit theen.	muje jesse plemons ke lawyer vale sabhi  seen pasand  ,muje lagta hai usne as sabi ceejo ko achi trah nibaya ,,muje achtray hua usaki boli sabi line actual fact par thi
It looks like we're all done here - thanks for chatting!	aisaa lagata haye jaise humm sub yahaan kaam curr chuke hain - baatchit key liye dhanyavaad!	ise laga jaise hum hi bat kar rahe ho
I don't remember much about the lawyer. I just liked how the other newspapers picke dup the mantle to support the Post and Times.	mujhe vakeel key baare mein jyada kuchh yaad naheen haye. mujhe yeh pasand aayaa kii kaise anya akhbaaron ney post aur times kaa samarthan karane kaa beedaa uthaaya.	mai  lawyer ke bare jayda nahi socha,maine keval yah socha dusre paper kasi support kare
Oh yeah, thanks!	oh haan, dhanyavaad!	oh ha thanks
Hello!	namaste!	namaste!
hey, what's up	kyaa chala rhaa haye	hey, kya ho raha hai
have you watched la la land before?	kyaa aapane pahale laa laa laind dekhi haye?	tumne pehle la la land dekhi hai?
Yes. I really appreciated how much thought went into the movie's title. I think it's really cool how it refers to Los Angeles, music, and having your head in the clouds all at once. It's really spectacular how they summed up so many elements of the movie in such a short title	haan. main vaastav mein isaki sarahana kartaa huun kii film key sheershak parr kitna vichaar kiya gayaa. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh vaastav mein achchha haye kii yeh kaise loss angils, sangeet aur ack hii samay mein aapka sir baadalon mein honey koo sandarbhit kartaa haye. yeh vaastav mein shandar haye kii kaise unhone itane chhote sheershak mein film key itane saare tatvon koo sankshep mein prastut kiya	Han, mein sach mein iss baat ki kadra karta hu ki iss film k title mein kitni soch lagayi hai. Mein sochta hu ki ye bohat cool hai ki ye film Los Angeles, snageet, aur apne sir badalon mein hone ka jikra ek sath karti hai.  Yah bohat shandar hai ki unhone itne sare tatvon ko ek sath shamil kar lia film k itne chhote title mein.
Have you seen it?	kyaa aapane ise dekhaa haye?	Kya tumne dekha hai?
yep -  i watched it because critics seemed to like it	haan - maine ise dekhaa kyonki alochakon koo yeh pasand aayaa	han - meine usse dekha hai kyuki wah aalochakon ko achhi lagi
I agree with most of the critics in the paper	main akhbar key adhikansh alochakon seey sahmat huun	Mein zyadatar aalochakon k sath sehmat hu
Yes. I especially agree with the review that La La Land is successful at showing the hardships that are involved with chasing a dream	haan. main vishesh roop seey iss sameeksha seey sahmat huun kii laa laa laind ack sapane kaa peechha karane mein aaney vaali kathinaaiyon koo dikhaane mein safal haye	Han. Mein uss review se khaaskar sehmat hu jismein kaha hai ki La La Land sapno k peeche bhaagne par aaney wali pareshaniyon ko dikhane mein safal huyi
I disagree with the two reviews that the film is dull and that the middle was boring. I really found the entire movie to be enthralling.	main una dou sameekshaon seey asahmat huun kii film neeras haye aur beach kaa bhaag ubaau haye. mujhe sachmuch poori film romanchkari luggy.	mein disgree hu dono reviews se ki film dull hai or middle boring tha.  Mujhe really puri movie enthralling lagi
yep, i agree with you - i do believe we have to cut emma stone and ryan gosling some slack, since they're not singers	haan, main aapse sahmat huun - mujhe vishvaas haye kii hamein emma stone aur rayan gosling koo thodaa dheela karna hoga, kyonki way gaayak naheen hain	Yep, mein aapse agree hu - mujhe believe hai humko emma stone and ryan gosling kuch slack hai, kyuki woh singers nahi hai
Agreed. I really liked the scene where Sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be playing Christmas music only.	maan gayaa. mujhe vaastav mein vaha drishya pasand aayaa jahaan sebastian jaiz sangeet mein sudhaar kartaa haye jabaki usey kewal chrismus sangeet bajaana hotaa haye.	Mujhe really woh scene pasand aaya jaha Sebastian jazz music play kiya, jaha usne sirf christmas music play kar raha hai
It was one of those scenes that really stuck with me after I watched the movie	yeh una drishyon mein seey ack thaa joe film dekhane key baad vaastav mein merey saath chipak gayaa	Yeh un scenes mein se ek hai jo movie dekhne ke baad mere se stuck ho gaye
would you do that, if you were in his position?	yadi aap usaki jagah parr hotey tou kyaa aap aisaa karate?	aap yesa karte, if aap uski position mein hote
I'm not sure. I liked how that was when Mia first heard Sebastian sing and was truly moved by it. I think it was interesting way to initiate their relationship	mujhe yakeen naheen haye. mujhe yeh pasand aayaa kii jaba miya ney pahali baar sebestian koo gaate hue sunaa thaa aur vaha vaastav mein usase prabhaavit hui thee. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh unake rishte koo shuru karane kaa dilchasp tarika thaa	I'm not sure, mujhe accha laga jab Mia ne pheli baar Sebastian ka gana suna aur kaise woh truly moved ho gayi. I think yeh unka relationship start karne ka interesting way hai
yeah, it was just sad how he brushed her off, since things could've been different	haan, yeh bahut dukhad thaa kii usane usey kaise nazarandaj curr diyaa, kyonki cheejen alag hoe sakati theen	Yeah, yeh sad hai usne kaise brush kiya, kyuki things different ho sakti thi
I do like how the next time Mia sees Sebastian he is also singing. I also liked how she kind of teased him by requesting a song she knew he would hate to sing	mujhe yeh pasand haye kii agali baar jaba miya sebastian koo dekhti haye tou vaha bhee gaa rhaa hotaa haye. mujhe yeh bhee pasand aayaa kii kaise usane ack gaane kaa anurodh karke usey chidhaaya, jisake baare mein usey pataa thaa kii usey gaane seey nafrat hogi	Mujhe accha laga next time Mia, Sebastian ko dekthi hai waih bhi gaa raha hai. Mujhe yeh bhi accha laga ki woh kaise unko ek song ka request karke tease kar rahi hai jabki woh janti hai woh gaane se hate karta hai
do you usually watch musicals?	kyaa aap aamtaur parr sangeet dekhate hain?	tum usually musicals dekhte ho
Occasionally. I also enjoyed the development of Sebastian and Mia's relationship, such as when Mia decides to begin writing a play all by herself because Sebastian suggests it to her. I feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a relationship	kabhi-kabhi. maine sebastian aur miya key rishte key vikas kaa bhee anand liya, jaise kii jaba miya akele hii ack naatak likhana shuru karane kaa faisala karati haye kyonki sebastian usey iska sujhaav detaa haye. mujhe aisaa lagata haye kii jaba way donon kissy rishte mein bandhate hain tou vaastav mein ack vyakti key roop mein vikasit hotey hain	Occasionally, mujhe Sbesatian aur Mia ke relationship ka development accha laga, jaise Mia se decide kiya apne aap se play write karne ka kyuki Sebastian ne usko suggest kiya.  Mujhe yesa feel hua dono jab grow hue jab wo relationship mein aaye
I enjoyed that part too, since it also shows how hard both of them are working to achieve their dreams	maine usa hisse kaa bhee anand liya, kyonki isase yeh bhee pataa chalata haye kii way donon apane sapnon koo hassil karane key liye kitni mehnat curr rahey hain	maine bhi wo part enjoy kiya, isme ye bhi dikhaya gaya hai kaise dono mehnat karte hai apne dreams achieve karne
they both want to become successful in their separate areas, but they have to struggle a lot	way donon apane-apane kshetron mein safal honah chaahte hain, lekin unhein kaafee sangharsh karna padata haye	dono apne separate areas mein kamiyaab hona chahte hai,lekin unhe bahut struggle karna hai
Right. I feel like the review that mentions the cruelty that's involved in following your dreams really sums it up. The film is not afraid to show how much hard work and hardship is involved in making it big	sahee. mujhe aisaa lagata haye kii jiss sameeksha mein aapke sapnon koo puuraa karane mein shamil krurta kaa ullekh kiya gayaa haye, vaha vaastav mein iska saar prastut karati haye. film yeh dikhaane seey naheen darti kii ise badaa banaane mein kitni mehnat aur kathinaaee shamil haye	sahi. mujhe lagta hai review jisme zulm ka zikar hai tumhaare khawaab puray karne wo bahut acha sum up kiya hai. film darti nahi hai ye dikhaane ke kitne mehnat aur hardship lagti hai kuch bada karne
i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keith's offer	maine yeh bhee socha kii sebastian key liye keath kaa prastaav sweekar karna kathin thaa	mujhe bhi laga sebastian  ko keith ka offer lene mushkil hui
i mean, he gets paid, but it's not something he wants to do. This happens in life a lot	meraa matlab haye, usey bhugtan milata haye, lekin yeh aisaa kuchh naheen haye joe vaha karna chaahata haye. jeevan mein aisaa bahut hotaa haye	mera matlab hai, usko pay mila lekin wo ye nahi karna chahta. Life mein aisa bahut hota hai
I agree. It must be hard to do something you're not passionate about- especially when it's something you must do in order to one day live out your dreams	main sahmat huun. aisaa kuchh karna kathin hoga jisake baare mein aap bhavuk naa houn- khaskar taba jaba yeh kuchh aisaa hoe joe aapako ack dinn apane sapnon koo puuraa karane key liye karna hii hoga.	main maanta hoon. aap jiske baare main passionate nahi hai,wo karna mushkil hai-especially jub wo kuch aisa hai jo aap ko karna hota hai ek din apne dreams puray karne
What did you think of the scene when Mia and Sebastian get into a fight about Mia thinking Sebastian is giving up on his dreams?	aapane usa drishya key baare mein kyaa socha jaba miya aur sebastian key beach iss baat koo laker jhagada hoe gayaa kii miya soch rahee thee kii sebastian apane sapnon koo chhod rhaa haye?	us scene ke baare mein aap ka kya khayal hai jub Mia aur Sebastian  ka jhagda hota hai aur Mia  samajhti hai Sebastian is giving up on his dreams?
it was definitely well acted, and i sympathize with both of them	yeh nishchit roop seey achchha abhinay thaa aur mujhe una donon key prati sahaanubhooti haye	ye yaqeenan well acted tha aur mujhe dono se sympathy hai
but i think sebastian was harsh when he said that mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful	lekin mujhe lagata haye kii sebestian taba kathor they jaba unhone kahaa kii asafal honey parr miya unhein adhik pasand karati haye	lekin shayad sebastian harsh tha jub usne kaha ke mia uskozyada pasand karti thi jub wo unsuccessful tha
It truly was heartbreaking when Mia moved back home to Nevada	yeh sachmuch hridayavidaarak thaa jaba miya apane ghar nevada vaapas chully gaee	sach mein bahut  heartbreaking tha jub Mia wapis apne ghar Nevada chale jaati hai
i feel he didn't want to hear the truth, because he was really giving up on his dreams	mujhe lagata haye kii vaha sach naheen sunana chaahata thaa, kyonki vaha vaastav mein apane sapnon koo tyag rhaa thaa	Mujhe lagta hai wo sach nahi sunna chahta kyunki wo apne sapno ko chod raha hai.
it really was sad	yeh sachmuch dukhad thaa	Wo sach mein sad tha.
I agree. It was also a very unpredictable plot twist. I did not see it coming at all	main sahmat huun. yeh bhee ack behad apratyaashit kathaanak modd thaa. maine ise bilkul bhee aatey naheen dekhaa	Main bhi maanta hun ki unpredictable twist tha kahani mein jiska bilkul andaza nahi tha.
would you say that was the low point in the movie?	kyaa aap kahenge kii yeh film kaa nimn bindu thaa?	Kya tum maante ho ki wo kahani ka low point tha ?
Yes but I wouldn't say any part of the movie "sagged badly" as one review claims	haan, lekin main yeh naheen kahoonga kii film kaa koee bhee hissa "buri tarah seey dheela" hoe gayaa haye, jaisa kii ack sameeksha mein daavaa kiya gayaa haye	Haan but mujhe nahi lagta ki movie ka koi bhi part sagged badly tha jaisa ki ek review ne claim kiya tha.
i agree - overall, i would recommend the movie to a friend	main sahmat huun - kull milakar, main ack dost koo film kii sifarish karunga	Main bhi maanta hun and main apne friend ko movie zaroor recommend karunga.
I agree. As another review points out it was a "genuinely romantic comedy", which I completely agree with because I feel as though Sebastian and Mia's relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in movies. I appreciated the realness of their relationship	main sahmat huun. jaisa kii ack anya sameeksha bataati haye kii yeh ack "vaastav mein romantic comedy" thee, jisase main poori tarah sahmat huun kyonki mujhe lagata haye kii sebastian aur miya kaa rishta utana ghisa-pitaa naheen thaa jitna kii kaee prem kahaaniyan filmon mein hoti hain. maine unake rishte kii vaastaviktaa kii sarahana kii	Main maanta hun ki movie genuinely romantic comedy thi jaise ki ek aur reviewer ne point out kiya kyunki mujhe lagta hai jaise Sebastian aur Mia ka relationship itna cliche nahi tha jitna dusri love stories mein hota hai. Mujhe unki relationship ki sachai achi lagi.
yes, that was one thing i loved about the movie - while it was sad, it was not a cliche ending	haan, yeh ack baat thee joe mujhe film key baare mein pasand aaee - halanki yeh dukhad thee, lekin iska anta ghisa-pitaa naheen thaa	Haan, Movie ki wo ek cheez achi thi chahe wo sad thi par wo ek cliche ending nahi thi.
I agree. I think Damien Chazelle really did a good job directing the film.	main sahmat huun. mujhe lagata haye kii damien chazelle ney film kaa nirdeshan karate hue vaastav mein achchha kaam kiya haye.	Main bhi agree karta hun ki Damien Chazelle ne film directing ka bahut acha kaam kiya hai.
i'm curious, are you an ai	main utsuk huun, kyaa aap aii hain?	Mujhe utsukta ho rahi, kya aap ai hain ?
if so, i was completely fooled	yadi haan, tou main poori tarah seey moorkh thaa	agar aisa hai to i was fooled
I am not!	main naheen huun!	main nahi hoon
But I really was surprised that someone reviewed Sebastian as a "jazz snob" because I did not get that vibe at all	lekin main vaastav mein aashcharyachakit thaa kii kissy ney sebastian kii sameeksha "jaiz snobe" key roop mein kii kyonki mujhe vaha bhavna bilkul bhee naheen millie	lekin main bohat surprised tha ki kisine Sebastaian ko 'jazz snob' review kia kyunki mujhe aisi vibe nahi aati
yeah, i disagreed with that characterization, but i can see why someone might say that.	haan, main usa charitra-chitran seey asahmat huun, lekin main samajh sakata huun kii koee aisaa kyon kaha sakata haye.	han mujhe bhi disagree hua is characterization se, lekin main samajh sakta hun kisine aisa kyun kaha hoga
he is a purist, or whatever they called it in the film	vaha ack shuddhatavadi haye, yaa joe kuchh bhee unhone ise film mein kahaa haye	wo ek purist hai, ya fir jo be usey movie mein bulaya gaya
I also really didn't think Mia's character lacked depth. I think she was a rather round character, especially with the large amount of independence she possessed. It took a lot of courage for her to move back to Nevada	mujhe vaastav mein yeh bhee naheen lagaa kii miya key charitra mein gehrai kii kamee haye. mujhe lagata haye kii vaha ack goal charitra vaali mahila thee, khaskar badee matra mein swatantrata key kaaran. nevada vaapas jaane key liye usey bahut saahas karna padaa	mujhe ye bhi nahi lagta ki Mia ke character mein depth ki kami thi. Mujhe lagta hau uska characted kafi round tha, khaaskar jis large amount mein uske paas independence thi. Use Nevada waapis move karne mein kafi courage laga.
yes, i thought her character was pretty nuanced, but i'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to Nevada. After the play didn't go well, I think that was her only option	haan, mujhe lagaa kii uska charitra kaafee sookshm thaa, lekin mujhe yakeen naheen haye kii nevada vaapas jaanaa usake liye sahsi hoga. naatak achchha naheen chalane key baad, mujhe lagata haye kii yahee uska ekmatra vikalp thaa	han mujhe laga uska character kafi nuanced tha lekin main sure nahi hun ki kya Nevada wpas jaana courageous tha. Play kharab jaane ke baad mujhe lagta hai uske paas sirf yahi option tha.
*about it	*isake baare mein	uske baare me
I suppose you have a point. I just think she was more independent of the average woman portrayed in films as she didn't cling on to Sebastian when things didn't work out for her.	mujhe lagata haye aapke paas koee baat haye. mujhe buss yahee lagata haye kii vaha filmon mein chitrit ausat mahila seey adhik swatantra thee kyonki jaba cheejen usake liye kaam naheen karati theen tou vaha sebastian seey chipki naheen rahati thee.	aapke pas point hai. Mujhe lagta hai wo films mein portray ki jaane wali average woman se zyada independent thu kyunki jab uska kaam sahi nahi bana to usne Sebastian ko cling nahi kia.
although I wish they reconciled before achieving their dreams	haalaanki main chaahata huun kii way apane sapnon koo hassil karane seey pahale sulah curr lein	lekin main chahta tha ki wo apne dreams achieve karne se pehle reconcile ho jaate
the bit at the end that showed what could have been actually made me sad	anta mein vaha ansh jisane dikhaaya kii vaastav mein mujhe dukhi karane vaalaa kyaa hoe sakata thaa	end me jo dikhaya tha, wah mujhe actually kafi sad kar sakta tha
I agree! It was very sad but also, as one reviewer puts it quite "bittersweet." I wasn't sure how to feel at the end.	main sahmat huun! yeh bahut dukhad thaa, lekin saath hii, jaisa kii ack sameekshak ise kaafee "kadwa-meethaa" bhee kahate hain. main nishchit naheen thaa kii anta mein kaisa mahsoos karuungaa.	I agree! ki wah bhi bahut sad tha, jaise ek reviewer ne kaha hai yah kafi "bittersweet" hai, mai sure nahi tha ki end mai kaisa feel karu.
It was nice discussing the film with you! Have a great day!	aapke saath film parr charcha karke achchha lagaa! aapka dinn achchha rahey!	tumhare sath film discuss karna nice tha! have a great day!
you guys have a pretty good ai system	aap logon key paas bahut achchha ai system haye	tum logo ke pass kafi badhiya ai system hai
i was actually completely fooled	main vaastav mein poori tarah seey moorkh thaa	mai actually complete fool ban gaya tha.
Hi there!	namaste!	hi
I haven't seen Bruce Almighty for some reason, but I do love Jim Carrey.	maine kissy kaaran seey broose olmitee naheen dekhi haye, lekin mujhe zim carrie pasand haye.	mein bruce almighty ko nahi dekha kuch reason ke liye, lekin muej jim carrey pasand hein
I haven't seen this one either, but I have heard that it is pretty funny.	maine ise dekhaa bhee naheen haye, lekin maine sunaa haye kii yeh bahut mazedaar haye.	mein bhi nahi dekha, lekin mein sunna hoon ki voh jyada funny hein
It's a pretty great idea. I'm sure it's not one of the greatest movies ever made, but he is really funny and so is Morgan Freeman.	yeh bahut badhiya vichaar haye. mujhe yakeen haye kii yeh abb taka bunny sabse mahaan filmon mein seey ack naheen haye, lekin vaha vaastav mein mazedaar haye aur morgan freeman bhee.	yeh tho badiya idea hein. muje nahi lagtha ki yeh unka greatest movies mein yek hein, kyon ki voh itna funny hein jaise morgan freeman ke tarah
Jennifer Aniston annoys me a little though, I gotta say	haalaanki, mujhe kahana hoga kii jennifer aniston mujhe thodaa pareshan karati haye	jeenifer aniston tho muje bahut annoys karti aur mein bolne hi vaali thi
I really do like Morgan Freeman, most of his movies are good. I think I might have to check this one out.	mujhe vaastav mein morgan freeman pasand haye, unaki adhikansh filmein achchi hain. mujhe lagata haye kii mujhe isaki jaanch karni parh sakati haye.	Main sahi mein Morgan Freeman ko pasand krta huin, uski bahut si movies achhi hain. Mujhe lagta hai ki mujhe isse bhi dekhna chahiye.
I look at Rotten Tomatoes a lot for movie ratings though, and 48% is pretty low. It has been out for a while, though.	haalaanki, main movie rating key liye rotten tomatose koo bahut dekhta huun, aur 48% kaafee cumm haye. haalaanki, yeh kuchh samay seey baahar haye.	Haanlanki main rotton tomatoes ko dekhta huin movie ratings check krne ke liye, aur 48% bahut kam hai. Haanlanki ye bahut dair se bahar hai.
I don't know why, but she has annoyed me through the years too. I can't quite put my finger on what it is, I just don't really like her very much.	mujhe naheen pataa kyon, lekin usane varshon seey mujhe bhee pareshan kiya haye. main thheek seey samajh naheen paa rhaa huun kii yeh kyaa haye, main vaastav mein usey bahut pasand naheen kartaa huun.	Mujhe nhi pta kyu, but usne mujhe saalon se pareshaan kiya hai. Main apni finger iss par nhi daal sakta ki yeh kya hai, sach mein main use bahut pasand nhi karta.
Yes, it has been out for quite some time. Maybe it's on Netflix.	haan, yeh kaafee samay seey baahar haye. shayed yeh netflix parr haye.	Han, kafi samay se bahar hai. Shayad ye Netflix pe bhi hai.
Do you like comedies like this, or are you more into dramas?	kyaa aapako iss tarah kii comedy pasand haye, yaa aap natakon mein adhik ruchi rakhate hain?	Kya tumhe aisi comedies pasand hai, ya tum tumhe dramas zyada pasand hai?
My favorite movie genre is science fiction, but I do like a good comedy, or a good drama. If it's a good movie, I really don't care what genre it is.	merrie pasandida film shally vigyaan kathaa haye, lekin mujhe achchi comedy yaa achchha naatak pasand haye. yadi yeh ack achchi film haye, tou mujhe vaastav mein isaki parwah naheen haye kii yeh kiss shally kii haye.	Meri favorite movie genre hai science fiction, but mujhe acchi comedy bhi acchi lagti hai, ya achha drama. Agar ye ek acchi movie hai, to main asal mein parwaah nhi krti ki ye kis genre ki hai.
That's true. The first review under the "critical response" section is pretty harsh. I'm not sure I really ever read or care about movie reviews, just the ratings % online	yeh sach haye. "mahatvapurna pratikriya" anubhaag key antargat pahali sameeksha kaafee kathor haye. mujhe yakeen naheen haye kii maine vaastav mein kabhi film sameekshaaen padhee hain yaa unaki parwah kartaa huun, buss ratings % online hain	Yeh sahi hai. "critical response" section ka pehla review bahut harsh hai. Main sure nhi huin main movie reviews padhne ya itni parwaah nhi krta, sirf online % ratings
When looking at movie reviews, I put more faith in actual regular people that go see the movie then I do official critics.	film sameekshaon koo dekhate samay, main aadhikarik alochakon kii tulana mein vaastavik niyamit logon parr adhik vishvaas kartaa huun joe film dekhane jaate hain.	Jab movie reviews dekhte, main faith official critics se zyada asal regular logo pe dekhta huin jo movie dekh kar aaye hain
True. Looking at the Key Scenes, I feel like the plot might have been a little paint-by-numbers and relying on Jim Carrey's personality too much, which is probably why it wasn't better recieved.	satya. mukhya drishyon koo dekhate hue, mujhe aisaa lagata haye kii kathaanak mein ankon key hisab seey thodaa-bahut rung-rogan kiya gayaa hoga aur zim carrie key vyaktitva parr bahut adhik nirbhar kiya gayaa hoga, shayed yahee kaaran haye kii ise behtar dhang seey praapt naheen kiya gayaa.	Sahi. Key Scenes ko dekhte hai, to mujhe lagta hai ki plot thoda paint-by-numbers aur Jim Carrey ki personality pe bahut zyada nirbhar hai, shayad issi wajah hai ki better nhi mila.
Yes, I can I didn't get that impression.	haan, main aisaa kaha sakata huun kii mujhe vaha aabhas naheen huaa.	Han, main kar skta huin mujhe achha impression nhi mila.
Sorry, this is supposed to say that I did get that impression.	kshama karein, iska tatparya yeh haye kii mujhe vaha aabhas huaa.	Sorry, ye kahana chahiye ki mujhe vah aabhas mila
I guess that's part of his appeal, he can take any kind of material and make it funny. Also Steve Carrell is a great, funny actor too and I can see him being a good villian.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh unaki appeal kaa hissa haye, vaha kissy bhee tarah kii samagri leey sakate hain aur usey mazedaar banaa sakate hain. isake alawa steve carrell ack mahaan, majakia abhineta bhee hain aur main unhein ack achche khalnayak key roop mein dekh sakata huun.	mujhe lagata hai ki ye unki appeal ka hissa hai, vah kisi bhi tarah ka material leke aur use funny bana sakate he. sath hi Steve Carrell ek mahaan, funny actor bhi hain aur main unhe ek achchha villian bhi dekh sakta hu.
Yes, he is pretty good in everything he does.	haan, vaha joe kuchh bhee kartaa haye usamen bahut achchha haye.	Ha, vah apane har kaam mein bahut achchhe hai.
I haven't even heard of Metacritic or CinemaScore, to be honest. But it's weird that it's 46/100 on Metacritic and and A on CinemaScore. Those are pretty different scores.	imandari seey kahuun tou maine metacritic yaa cinemascore key baare mein bhee naheen sunaa haye. lekin yeh ajib haye kii metacritic parr yeh 46/100 haye aur cinemascore parr aii. way kaafee bhinn score hain.	Maine bhi Metacritic ya Cinemascore pramanik hone ke bare mein nahin suna hai. lekin yah ajib hai ki yah Metacritic par 46/100 hai aur Cinemascore pe A hai. yah bahut alag scores hain.
That's true, I'm not sure how they score these things.	yeh sach haye, mujhe yakeen naheen haye kii way inn cheejon koo kaise score karate hain.	yah sach hai, mujhe yakin nahin hai ki ve in chijo ko kaise score karte hai.
The part where he creates the email system to answer prayers and sets it to auto-reply "yes" is pretty funny and says a lot about religion.	vaha bhaag jahaan vaha prarthanaon kaa uttar dene key liye email system banaata haye aur usey swachaalit-uttar "haan" parr sett kartaa haye, kaafee majedar haye aur dharm key baare mein bahut kuchh kahata haye.	vah hissa jaha vah prarthanao ka javab dene ke liye email system banata hai aur ise auto-reply "haa" ke liye set karata hai vah bahut hi majedar hai aur dhharm ke bare me bahut kuchh kahata hai.
Sounds pretty funny, I will have to put it on my list.	bahut ajib lagata haye, mujhe ise apani soochi mein rakhna hoga.	Bahut majedar lagata hai, mujhe ise apane list mein rakhana hoga.
I do think maybe some of the scenes they describe with Jimmy Hoffa's body sound cheesy. I'm not sure!	mujhe lagata haye kii shayed jimi hoffa key shareer key saath way jinn drishyon kaa varnan karate hain unamen seey kuchh ghatiya lugg rahey hain. mujhe yakeen naheen haye!	Mujhe lagata hai ki sayad Jimmy Hoffa ki body sound ke saath kuchh drashyon ka varnan hai. main sure nahin hu!
I agree with that statement.	main usa kathan seey sahmat huun.	Main usse sahamat hu
I do think if I had the power of being God I'd use it for better things!	mujhe lagata haye kii aggar merey paas bhagwan honey kii shakti hoti tou main iska istemal behtar cheejon key liye kartaa!	mujhe lagata hai ki agar mere paas God hone ki shakti hoti to main isaka istemal behtar chijon ke liye karata
For sure!	pakka!	for sure
Interesting. I mean, the way the rest of the plot wraps up seems pretty standard.	dilchasp. meraa matlab haye, jiss tarah seey kathaanak kaa shesh bhaag samaapt hotaa haye vaha kaafee maanak lagata haye.	Interesting. I mean baaki jaise plot wrap up hote hai kaafi standard lagta hai
I agree, however, it might be worth a watch.	haalaanki, main sahmat huun kii yeh dekhane laayak hoe sakata haye.	I agree, but ek time watch worth ho sakti hai
The best part of the movie is probably the middle section where he's testing out all of his powers. Seems like the end might be disappointing based on this description.	film kaa sabse achchha hissa shayed madhya bhaag haye jahaan vaha apani saaree shaktiyon kaa pareekshan curr rhaa haye. aisaa lagata haye kii iss vivaran key aadhar parr anta nirashajanak hoe sakata haye.	Movie ka best part probably middle section hai jaha wo apni sari power test karta hai. Aisa lagta hai k end description k basis pe disappointing ho sakta hai
I'm not the hugest Jim Carrey fan, but I'll give it a try.	main zim carrie kaa sabse badaa prashansak naheen huun, lekin main ise aazamaaunga.	Main Jim Carrey ka bada fan to nahi hu , but main ek try karunga
Yeah I think he is so out-there that this is a perfect film for him.	haan, mujhe lagata haye kii vaha itna alag haye kii yeh usake liye ack aadarsh film haye.	Haan mujhe lagta hai k wo aise bahar hai k ye film uske liye perfect hai
Yeah, he always seems to play some crazy out-of-control guy.	haan, vaha hamesha kissy pagal, niyantran seey baahar vyakti kii bhoomika nibhaata nazar aataa haye.	Haan wo hamesha koi crazy out of control aadmi play karta hai

Good to know, what studio is it produced by?	yeh jaankar achchha lagaa kii yeh kiss studio dwara nirmit haye?	good to know, kis studio ne isse produce kiya hai?
I'm not sure about that but did you know there was an earlier movie about the same book?	main isake baare mein nishchit naheen huun lekin kyaa aap jaanate hain kii isi kitab parr pahale bhee koee film bunny thee?	Muze nahi pata uske bareme , per tum ko pata hai kay there was an earlier movie about the same book?
So  it's based on a book?	tou yeh ack kitab parr adharit haye?	to, ye kitap be based hai?
Yes, it's based on Alan Turing:  The Enigma and the earlier movie was called Breaking the Code, it was on BBC.	haan, yeh ellen turing: dha anigma parr adharit haye aur pichhali film kaa naam breaking dha code thaa, yeh bbc parr thee.	yes, ye based hai Alan Turing: The Enigma or pehele ki movie ka nam tha  Breaking the Code, wo BBC pe thi
Good to know, although I didn't ask; does it say who starred in the BBC version?	jaankar achchha lagaa, haalaanki maine naheen poochha; kyaa yeh bataata haye kii bbc sanskaran mein kisane abhinay kiya?	jaanakaar achchha laga, haalaanki mainne poochha nahin; kya yah kahana hai ki BBC sanskaran mein kisane abhinay kiya
No, but I've got info on a few of the key scenes if you're interested in knowing?	naheen, lekin yadi aap jaanane mein ruchi rakhate hain tou mujhe kuchh pramukh drishyon key baare mein jaankaari millie haye?	nahin, lekin mujhe kuchh pramukh drshyon kee jaanakaaree milee hai yadi aap jaanane mein ruchi rakhate hain?
Absolutely, are the scenes taken from the book, the BBC version, or the movie?	bilkul, kyaa yeye drishya kitab, bbc sanskaran yaa film seey liye gaye hain?	poorn roop se, pustak se lie gae drshy hain, BBC sanskaran, ya philm?
From the 2014 movie with Cumberbatch and Knightley.  The earliest scene has Turing in boarding school being bullied, and he makes a friend there that gets him interested in cryptography.	comberbatch aur nightly key saath 2014 kii film seey.  shuruati drishya mein turing koo boarding school mein dhamkaya jaa rhaa haye, aur vaha vahaan ack dost banaata haye joe usey cryptography mein ruchi detaa haye.	2014 kee philm se kambarabaich aur naitalee ke saath. shuruaatee drshy mein tyooring in bording skool ko badanaam kiya ja raha hai, aur vah vahaan ek dost banaata hai jo use kriptograaphee mein dilachaspee leta hai.
That's cool, so it's sort of a biographical movie?	yeh badhiya haye, tou yeh ack tarah kii jeevani parr adharit film haye?	yah achchha hai, to yah ek jeevanee philm kee tarah hai?
The next scene is when Britain declares war on Germany, Turing goes to work at a place called Bletchley Park that is trying to decode the Nazi's Enigma Machine.  Yes, it's a historical drama.	agala drishya taba hotaa haye jaba britten germany parr yuddh kii ghoshana kartaa haye, turing bailechale park naamak sthaan parr kaam karane jaataa haye joe naaji kii anigma machine koo decode karane kii koshish curr rhaa haye.  haan, yeh ack aitihaasik naatak haye.	agala drshy hai jab briten ne jarmanee par yuddh kee ghoshana kee, tyooring ek jagah par kaam karane jaata hai jise bailechale paark kaha jaata hai vah naajee kee pahelee masheen ko dikod karane kee koshish kar raha hai. haan, yah ek aitihaasik naatak hai.
Do you want to hear the plot?	kyaa aap kathaanak sunana chaahte hain?	kya aap kathaanak sunana chaahate hain?
Does it mention how accurate the movie is as opposed to real-life events; that's why I was asking if it was biographical as opposed to simply historical?	kyaa isamen ullekh haye kii vaastavik jeevan kii ghatnaaon key vipareet film kitni sateek haye; isiliye main poochh rhaa thaa kii kyaa yeh kewal aitihaasik key vipareet jeevani parr adharit thaa?	kya yah ullekh karata hai philm vaastavik jeevan kee ghatanaon ke vipareet kitanee sahee hai; isalie main poochh raha tha yadi yah keval aitihaasik ke vipareet jeevanee thee?
Oh.  One of the critics says it rearranges the time sequences and invents fictional characters.	oh.  alochakon mein seey ack kaa kahana haye kii yeh samay anukramon koo punarvyavasthit kartaa haye aur kaalpanik paatron kaa aavishkaar kartaa haye.	oh. ek aalochak kahata hai yah samay drshyon ko punarvyavasthit karata hai aur kaalpanik paatron ko laagoo karata hai.
Thanks for the clarification , are there any more excerpts?	spashteekaran key liye dhanyavaad, kyaa koee aur ansh hain?	spashteekaran ke lie dhanyavaad, kya koee aur ansh hain?
Yes, the plot sounds really good.  Turing manages to decrypt the Nazi code machine, but the Nazis change the code every day.  So they all realize they can't act on every day's decrypted messages or the Nazis will know that their code machine is useless.	haan, kathaanak vaastav mein achchha lagata haye.  turing naazi code machine koo decrypt karane mein safal hoe jaataa haye, lekin naazi harr dinn code badalate hain.  isaliye una sabhi koo ehsas huaa kii way harr dinn key decrypted sandeshon parr kaarravaai naheen curr sakate hain yaa naajiyon koo pataa chala jaayega kii unaki code machine bekaar haye.	haan, kathaanak vaastav mein achchha lagata hai. tyooring naajee kod masheen ko dikript karane ka prabandhan karata hai, lekin naajiyon ne har din kod badal diya. isalie ve sabhee mahasoos karate hain ki ve har din dikript kie gae sandeshon par kaam nahin kar sakate hain ya naajiyon ko pata chal jaega ki unakee kod masheen bekaar hai.
Interesting, does it mention how it's resolved, or does it leave you sort of on the cliff?	dilchasp haye, kyaa isamen bataaya gayaa haye kii iska samadhan kaise kiya gayaa, yaa kyaa yeh aapako mushkil mein daal detaa haye?	dilachasp hai, yah ullekh karata hai ki yah kaise hal ho gaya hai, ya kya yah aapako chattaan par chhodata hai?
It kind of leaves a cliffhanger there.  There are a couple of twists, though.	yeh vahaan ack prakaar kii ulajhan chhod detaa haye.  haalaanki, isamen kuchh modd hain.	yah vahaan ek kliphanar ko chhod deta hai. haalaanki kuchh jode hain.
Does it say whether the main characters survive to the end, or are they wounded, etcetera?	kyaa yeh bataata haye kii kyaa mukhya paatr anta taka jeevit bache hain, yaa way ghayal hain, vagairah-vagairah?	kya yah kahata hai ki kya mukhy paatr ant tak jeevit rahate hain, ya ve ghaayal hote hain, vagairah?
It doesn't tell.  One of the twists in the plot is that a Russian spy is discovered by Turing.  Which isn't surprising at first, but then we find out that British intelligence planted him to tell the Russians secrets they wanted them to know, after all Russia and Great Britain were on the same side in WWII.	yeh naheen bataata.  kathaanak mein ack modd yeh haye kii turing dwara ack russie jasus kii khoj kii jaati haye.  joe pahale tou ashcharya kii baat naheen haye, lekin phir hamein pataa chalaa kii british khufiya ney usey rusiyon koo rahasya bataane key liye niyukt kiya thaa joe way unhein jaanana chaahte they, aakhirkaar dwiteeya vishva yuddh mein roose aur grate britten ack hii paksh mein they.	yah nahin bataata. saajish mein ek tvist yah hai ki tyooring dvaara ek roosee jaasoos kee khoj kee jaatee hai. yah pahalee baar mein aashcharyachakit karane vaala nahin hai, lekin phir hamen pata chala ki british khuphiya ne unhen roos ke rahasyon ko bataane ke lie lagaaya tha, jo ve jaanana chaahate the, aakhirakaar roos aur gret briten wwii mein ek hee taraph the.
That's sort of a twisted narrative of the political situation, but whatever, anything else super useful or interesting, (it sounds like a great movie)?	yeh ack tarah seey raajneetik sthiti kii ack vikrit kahani haye, lekin joe bhee hoe, kyaa isake alawa koee behad upayogi yaa dilchasp cheez haye, (yeh ack mahaan film kii tarah lagati haye)?	yah raajaneetik sthiti ke ek mod kee tarah hai, lekin jo kuchh bhee, supar upayogee ya dilachasp hai, (yah ek mahaan philm kee tarah lagata hai)?
When I watched the movie, I liked the codebreaking machine they had,  It was this massive technical looking wall that was way before the time of WWII.  Yes, there's another twist in the plot where the Russian spy threatens to tell everyone that Turing is homosexual.	jaba maine film dekhi, tou mujhe unake paas maujood codebreaking machine pasand aaee, yeh ack vishal takniki dikhane vaali deewaar thee joe dwiteeya vishva yuddh key samay seey bahut pahale kii thee.  haan, kahani mein ack aur modd haye jahaan russie jasus sabhi koo yeh bataane kii dhamki detaa haye kii turing samalaingik haye.	jab mainne philm dekhee, to mujhe unake paas kodabreking masheen pasand aaee, yah is vishaal takaneekee dikhane vaalee deevaar thee jo wwii ke samay se pahale thee. haan, saajish mein ek aur mod hai jahaan roosee jaasoos ne sabhee ko yah bataane kee dhamakee dee ki tyooring samalaingik hai.
How did the spy know that Turing was gay?	jasus koo kaise pataa chalaa kii turing samalaingik haye?	jaasoos ko kaise pata chala ki tyooring samalaingik tha?
Turing told the spy, because Turing was about to get married to Clarke (Knightley).  It sounds like high drama to me.  The spy (before Turing realized he was a spy) told Turing to keep his homosexuality a secret.  I guess they were pretty tight.	turing ney jasus koo bataaya, kyonki turing kii shaadi clark (nightly) seey honey vaali thee.  yeh mujhe haaee drama jaisa lagata haye.  jasus ney (turing koo ehsas honey seey pahale kii vaha ack jasus thaa) turing koo apani samalaingikta koo gupt rakhane key liye kahaa.  mujhe lagata haye kii way kaafee tanga they.	tyooring ne jaasoos ko bataaya, kyonki tyooring kee shaadee klaark (naitalee) se hone vaalee thee. yah mujhe uchch naatak kee tarah lagata hai. jaasoos (tyooring se pahale ehasaas hua ki vah ek jaasoos tha) ne tyooring ko apanee samalaingikata ko gupt rakhane ke lie kaha tha. mujhe lagata hai ki ve bahut tang the.
Wow, that's a big ol' ball of secrecy for that time period, is there anything else about the plot or whatever you should tell me?	vaah, yeh usa samay avadhi key liye gopaniyata kaa ack badaa rahasya haye, kyaa kathaanak key baare mein kuchh aur haye yaa joe kuchh bhee aapako mujhe bataana chaahiye?	vaah, yah us samay kee avadhi ke lie ek badee raajabhaasha gopaneeyata kee gend hai, kya saajish ke baare mein kuchh aur hai ya jo kuchh bhee aapako mujhe bataana chaahie?
Yes, at the end of the movie, the Allies win the war and the boss makes the cryptographers promise to never see each other again and they destroy all the code.  Also, Turing tells Clarke (Knightley) to leave because he is scared for her safety.  He tells her he is gay and that he never cared for her, which wasn't true because he was in love with her.	haan, film key anta mein, mitra rashtra yuddh jeet jaate hain aur boss cryptographers seey ack-dusare koo phir kabhi naa dekhane kaa vaadaa karaate hain aur way sabhi code nasht curr dete hain.  saath hii, turing clark (nightly) koo chaley jaane key liye kahata haye kyonki vaha usaki suraksha koo laker daraa huaa haye.  vaha usey bataata haye kii vaha samalaingik haye aur usane kabhi usaki parwah naheen kii, joe sach naheen thaa kyonki vaha usase pyaar kartaa thaa.	haan, philm ke ant mein, mitr raashtr yuddh jeetata hai aur bos kriptograaphars ko ek doosare ko phir kabhee nahin dekhane ka vaada karata hai aur ve sabhee kod ko nasht kar dete hain. isake alaava, tyooring klaark (naitalee) ko chhodane ke lie kahata hai kyonki vah usakee suraksha ke lie darata hai. vah usase kahata hai ki vah samalaingik hai aur usane kabhee usakee paravaah nahin kee, jo sach nahin tha kyonki vah usake saath pyaar mein thee.
It got a pretty good score on Rotten Tomatoes.	rotten tomatose parr ise kaafee achchha score milaa.	roten tomaatoz par ise bahut achchha skor mila.
What's the rotten tomatoes score?	sadey hue tamatar kaa score kyaa haye?	sada hua tamaatar skor kya hai?
Rotten Tomatoes is 91%, CinemaScore is A+, and Metacritic Score is a bit low at 73/100.	rotten tomatose 91% haye, cinemascore aii+ haye, aur metacritic score thodaa cumm 73/100 haye.	roten tomaatoz 91% hai, sinemaaskor e + hai, aur metaakritik skor 73/100 par thoda kam hai.
Hmm, not bad at all, does it say when it was released?	humm, bilkul bhee buraa naheen haye, kyaa yeh bataata haye kii ise kaba release kiya gayaa thaa?	hamm, bilkul bhee bura nahin hai, yah kahata hai ki yah kab jaaree kiya gaya tha?
I think that about does it for this movie, do you think you'll see it?	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh iss film key liye haye, kyaa aapako lagata haye kii aap ise dekhenge?	mujhe lagata hai ki is philm ke baare mein kya aapako lagata hai ki aap ise dekhenge?

It sounds really good, more likely than not, I will; how about you?	yeh vaastav mein achchha lagata haye, adhik sambhavana haye kii main aisaa karunga; aap kaise hain?	yah vaastav mein achchha lagata hai, adhik sambhaavana nahin hai, main karoonga; aap kaise hain?
I didn't realize I had already seen it until I started reading this.  I remember it was really good.  If a movie isn't good I usually don't recall it this clearly.	jaba taka maine ise padhana shuru naheen kiya, mujhe ehsas hii naheen huaa kii maine ise pahale hii dekh liya haye.  mujhe yaad haye yeh sachmuch bahut achchha thaa.  yadi koee film achchi naheen haye tou aamtaur parr main ise spasht roop seey yaad naheen rakh paataa.	I didn't realize I had already seen it until I started reading this. I remember it was really good. If a movie isn't good I usually don't recall it this clearly.
It was definitely a good look into what life was like during that horrible war.  It's been good chatting with you, I enjoyed.	yeh nishchit roop seey usa bhayaanak yuddh key dauran jeevan kaisa thaa, iska ack achchha avalokan thaa.  aapke saath baatchit karke achchha lagaa, anand aayaa.	us bhayaanak yuddh ke dauraan jeevan kaisa tha, yah nishchit roop se achchha tha. yah aapake saath achchhee chaiting hai, mujhe maza aaya.
Lol, likewise, I'm pretty sure we just do the exit survey at this point and tell them whether we want to see the movie, right?	loll, isi tarah, mujhe puuraa yakeen haye kii humm iss bindu parr sirf exit sarvekshan karenge aur unhein bataayenge kii kyaa humm film dekhana chaahte hain, haye naa?	yogy, isee tarah, mujhe poora yakeen hai ki ham sirph is bindu par baahar nikalane ka sarvekshan karenge aur unhen bataenge ki kya ham philm dekhana chaahate hain, hai na?
Hi are you ready to get started? This is a batman vs superman superhero crossover movie. Are you familiar with those superheroes?	namaste kyaa aap aarambh karane key liye taiyar hain? yeh ack batman banaam superman superheiro crossover film haye. kyaa aap una superheiro seey parichit hain?	Hi kya tum shuru krne ke liye tyaar ho? Yeh batman vs superman ek superhero crossover movie hai. Kya tum inn superheroes ko jante ho?
We are here to discuss Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice	humm yahaan batman banaam superman: donn off justice parr charcha karane key liye aae hain	Hum yahan Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice ko discuss karenge
Yes i am familar with the characters but some of the actors i have never heard of	haan, main paatron seey parichit huun, lekin kuchh abhinetaon key baare mein maine kabhi naheen sunaa haye	Han mujhe inn cahracters ke baare mein pta hai but kuch actors ke baare mein maine kabhi sunna nhi
I think it sounds like an amazing movie. I love superheroes. I think some of the critics are too harsh. It was a good plot line. I am familiar with Ben Affleck but none of the others.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh ack adbhut film lagati haye. mujhe superheiro bahut pasand hain. mujhe lagata haye kii kuchh aalochak bahut kathor hain. yeh ack achchi kathaanak thee. main bayne affleck seey parichit huun lekin anya kissy seey naheen.	Mujhe lagta hai ki yeh ek bahut achhi movie hai. Mujhe superheroes bahut pasand hai. Yeh achhi plot line thi. Main Ban Affleck ke baare mein jaanta huin but bake kisi ke baare mein nhi.
I wish they would have used more famous people.	kaash unhone adhik prasiddh logon kaa upayog kiya hotaa.	Kaash unhone zyada famous logo ko liya hota.
I would agree though that it was not as good as man of steel. The plot line of that was amazing!	haalaanki main iss baat seey sahmat huun kii yeh steel maine jitna achchha naheen thaa. uska kathaanak adbhut thaa!	Main sehmat huin jabki woh man of steel jitni achhi nhi hai. Uski plot line bahut badiya thi!
Ben Affleck is the only actor I recognize great plot very harsh critcs	bayne affleck ekmatra aise abhineta hain jinhen main mahaan kathaanak aur kathor alochakon key roop mein pahachaantaa huun	Ben Affleck hi sirf ek aisa actor hai jise main pehnchanta huin achha plot bhut harsh critics
I agree. I didn't completely understand why Batman and Superman fought though.	main sahmat huun. haalaanki mujhe poori tarah samajh naheen aayaa kii batman aur superman kyon ladey.	I agree, mujhe theek se samajh nahi aaya ki Batman and Superman kyun lad rahe the
Rotten Tomatoes list it as 27%and average with a 4.9 out of 10. The critcs must be weird. Yeah i couldnt figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce waynes dad	rotten tomatose ney ise 27% aur 10 mein seey 4.9 key saath ausat key roop mein soochibaddh kiya haye. aalochak ajib honge. haan, main ladaai kaa pataa naheen lagaa sakaa lekin mujhe lagata haye kii aisaa isaliye huaa kyonki superman ney galati seey broose weins key pitaa koo maar daala thaa	Rotten Tomatoes par 27% hai and average 4.9 hai 10 mein se. Critics bahut ajeeb hain. Mujhe fight samajh nahi aayi par mujhe lagta hai ki Superman ne galti se Bruce Wayne ke Dad ko maar diya tha.
I thought it was worth a meteoritic score more than 44. That seemed low! That makes sense. I would be mad if someone tried to kill one of my family members.	maine socha kii yeh 44 seey adhik key ulkapind score key laayak thaa. yeh cumm lugg rhaa thaa! yeh samajh aataa haye. aggar koee merey parivaar key kissy sadasya koo maarne kii koshish karega tou main pagal hoe jaaoonga.	Mujhe laga ki movie ka Meteoritic score 44 se jyada hai. Yeh toh kam hai! Par sense karta hai. Mujhe bhi bahut gussa ayega agar kisi ne mere family waalon ko maar diya.
hello?	namaste?	Haan?!
Yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of Lex Luthor who just seems to go doown hill the whole movie. I like how the critic talked about Lex (who is supermans arch enemy ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler (who are batmans arch enemies	haan, isamen lakes luther key charitra parr ack anokha spin bhee thaa joe poori film mein bahut hii nirashajanak lagata haye. mujhe pasand aayaa kii aalochak ney lakes (joe superman kaa kattar dushman haye) key baare mein baat kii kyonki usane usaki tulana joker aur riddler (joe batman key kattar dushman hain) seey kii	Haan mujhe bhi, saath mein Lex ke character ka unique spin hai aur voh bus spiral down karta hai poori movie mein. Joh critics ne Lex (joh Superman ka arch enemy hai) ke baare mein bola, voh mujhe accha laga, kyunki unhone Lex ko Joker and Riddler ke saath compare kiya.
Then he tops off the crazy part by comparing him to Mark Zuckerburg.	phir vaha maark jukerberg seey tulana karke pagalpan kii hudd taka aage badh jaataa haye.	Aur fir voh pagalon jaise usko Mark Zuckerburg se compare karne laga.
Ohh. I liked that too. I like how they always try to biring in the government official s	oh. mujhe vaha bhee pasand aayaa. mujhe pasand haye kii kaise way hamesha sarkari adhikaariyon koo laane kii koshish karate hain	Ohh, voh mujhe bhi accha laga. Mujhe accha laga ki they always bring in government officials.
Yeah im still here just slow typer	haan, main abhee bhee yahaan huun, buss dheema typer huun	Yeah, meri typing slow hai, I'm still here.
Do you like batman or superman better in the movie?	kyaa aapako film mein batman yaa superman jyada pasand haye?	Tujhe jyada accha kaun laga, Batman or Superman iss movie mein?
Actually superman	darasal superman	Actually Superman.
How bout u	tumhare baare mein kyaa	tumhare regarding  kya vichar he
I grew up watching the justice league cartoons in thelate 70s and early 80s in which alll the superheros worked together.	main 70 key dashak key anta aur 80 key dashak kii shuruat mein justice leag key cartoon dekhkar badaa huaa huun, jisamen sabhi superheiro ney ack saath kaam kiya thaa.	70 aur early 90s Me, me Cartoon JUstice League dekhte hue grew up hua jisame all super hero milkar work karte he.
I love batman	mujhe batman pasand haye	mujhe batman se love he
He is so mysterious	vaha bahut rahasyamay haye	vo bahut mysterious he
Sorta ironic that they become enemies	yeh cassie vidambana haye kii way dushman bunn jaate hain	ye bada ironic he ki ve enemies ban jate he
Yes he is very mysterious	haan vaha bahut rahasyamay haye	ha vo bada mysterious he
It is. Its not what I expected at all	yeh haye. yeh bilkul vaisi naheen haye jisaki mujhe aasha thee	it is.ye to mene bilkul bhi expect nahi kiya tha
I expected more like the avengers where a bunch of heroes work together	main avengers kii tarah adhik ummeed kartaa huun jahaan nayakon kaa ack samooh ack saath kaam kartaa haye	iske bajay , me to Avenger ki try expect kar raha tha where heroes ka bunch together work karta he.
I don't really like that they are enimies	mujhe vaastav mein yeh pasand naheen haye kii way dushman hain	mujhe unka ememies hona really pasand nahi aaya.
Especially to the point where batman was going to kill superman	visheshkar usa bindu taka jahaan batman superman koo maarne jaa rhaa thaa	Especially us point par jahan Batman, Superman ko kill karne ja raha tha.
Me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent was trying to make bruce wayne and batman look bad thru his news articles	lekh mein kahaa gayaa haye kii maine yaa tou superman ney hii isaki shuruat kii thee, lekin clark kent apane samachar lekhon key jariye broose wein aur batman koo kharab dikhaane kii koshish curr rahey they.	mujhe bhi par pretty much superman ne ye start kiya article kehta hai clark kent apne news articles se bruce wayne aur batman ko bad dikhane ki try kar raha tha
You know though to be honest if you look at the way the world is today so full of bad it makesperfect sense in a world view to have them as enemies.	haalaanki, aap jaanate hain kii imandar honey key liye aggar aap dekhein kii duniya aaj itani buri tarah seey bharee hui haye kii duniya kii drishti seey unhein dushman key roop mein rakhna bilkul uchit haye.	kya tum jante ho to be honest agar tum dekho world ajkal kis way ka hai full of bad to world view mein unhe enemies ki tarah hona perfect sense banata hai
I guess so. They do have polar opposite personalities. One is a humble farm boy and the other is a rich executive	mujhe bhee aisaa hii lagata haye. unake paas dhruviya vipareet vyaktitva hain. ack vinamra kisan ladka haye aur doosara ack ameer kaaryakaari haye	Main aisa hi guess karta hun. Un dono ki polar opposite personalities hain. Ek humble farmboy hau aur dusra rich executive hai.
I could see why they clash in that aspect, but I guess I don't imagine them interacting very much in superhero world.	main dekh sakata huun kii way usa pahalu mein kyon takaraate hain, lekin mujhe lagata haye kii main unhein superheiro kii duniya mein bahut adhik baatchit karane kii kalpana naheen kartaa.	Main samajh sakta hun us aspect mein unhone kyun clash kiya, par I guess main unhe superhero world mein zaya interact karte nahi dekhta.
It says in the 3rd part that at supermans funeral that bruce way e apol9gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman	teesare bhaag mein kahaa gayaa haye kii superman key antim sanskar mein broose wein ney lois laine seey maafi maangate hue kahaa kii vaha superman koo whiffle curr diyaa.	ye 3rd part mein kehte hai ki superman ke funera mein bruce wayne apologise karta hai lois lane ko ki he failed superman

Hello! Isn't Monsters University a great movie? It was true to the spirit of Monsters, Inc. and matched its tone.	namaste! kyaa monsters university ack behtareen film naheen haye? yeh monsters, ink. kii bhavna key anuroop thaa aur usake swar seey mell khaata thaa.	namste, monster university ek badia movie lagti hai na? monster ki aatam aur soch se bilkul meel khati hai
I agree.  It was a good movie	main sahmat huun.  yeh ack achchi film thee	main sehmat hoon, vo ik achi movie thi.
What was your favorite part?	aapka pasandida hissa kyaa thaa?	kaun sa part tumhe acha lagga?
I liked when Mike and Sully didn't finish the program and worked their way up the ranks anyways.	mujhe achchha lagaa jaba mike aur sulee ney karyakram puuraa naheen kiya aur phir bhee rank mein oopar aaney key liye kaam kiya.	muje acha lagga jab mike aur ully ne program khatam nahi kiya aur phir bhi mehnat se tarraki ki
Me too! It was very inspiring and showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways. I liked how the movie expanded on the monster world.	main bhee! yeh bahut preranadayak thaa aur dikhaaya kii aap apane sapnon koo kaee tarikon seey puuraa curr sakate hain. mujhe yeh pasand aayaa kii kaise film rakshas duniya parr vistaarit hui.	meje bhi veh ik parerna thi aur darshata tha ki tum apne khawab pure kar sakte ho, jaisa movie ne batae monster world main muje vo acha lagga
Yes.  The first movie only gave one facet of the world, while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree.	haan.  pahali film ney duniya kaa kewal ack pahalu pesh kiya, jabaki doosari ney setting koo bahut badey paimaane parr vikasit kiya.	haan. pehli movie main sirk ik hissa dikha tha tha us duniya ka jab ki dusri ne sathapna kaafi had tak kar di
When I heard they were making another Monsters Inc movie I expected a sequel, not a prequel. But I ended up loving it! Did you see it in theatres?	jaba maine sunaa kii way ack aur monsters ink film banaa rahey hain tou mujhe prekwal naheen balki seekwal kii ummeed thee. lekin aakhirkaar mujhe isase pyaar hoe gayaa! kyaa aapane ise cinemagharon mein dekhaa?	jab maine sunna k vo ik aur monsters inc move bana rahe hai mainse uska agla hissa samja jab ki vi usse peche ki kahani hai. par muje acha lagga . kya tumne theater main dekhi thi.
I don't think we saw it in the theatre.  I think we rented it.  It's been a while though.  I should show it to my kids.  They would probably like it.	mujhe naheen lagata kii hamane ise theatre mein dekhaa haye.  mujhe lagata haye kii hamane ise kiraaye parr liya haye.  haalaanki kaafee samay hoe gayaa haye.  mujhe ise apane bachchon koo dikhaana chaahiye.  unhein shayed yeye pasand aayega.	muje nahi lagta humne theater main dekhi thi. shayad hume kiraye pe li thi. kaafi samma ho gaya. main ajarur  apne bachon ko dikhaunga
I bet they would! I don't have kids but my coworkers do. I love Disney/Pixar movies so I recommend them to my coworkers a lot.	mujhe yakeen haye way aisaa karenge! merey bachche naheen hain lekin merey sahakarmiyon key bachche hain. mujhe disney/pixer filmein pasand hain isaliye main apane sahakarmiyon koo unaki bahut anushansa kartaa huun.	main sharat lagata hun k vo! mere koi bache nahi hai par sath kam karne vaale hain muje disney/pixer movie pasand hai isiliye main apne sath karne valon ko batata hun.
I really enjoy Randy Newman's music on this, the Toy Story movies, and Finding Nemo/Dory.	main vaastav mein iss parr randy neuman key sangeet, toy story filmon aur finding nimo/dorry kaa anand letaa huun.	muje randy newman's ka sangeet uspe acha lagga toy stories aur finding nemo/dory
Me too! I think the Toy Story movies might be my favorite Pixar movies. Did you hear that they're building a Toy Story Land in Walt Disney World this summer?	main bhee! mujhe lagata haye kii toy story filmein merrie pasandida pixer filmein hoe sakati hain. kyaa aapane sunaa haye kii way iss garmi mein walt disney worled mein ack toy story laind kaa nirmaan curr rahey hain?	Mujhe bhi! I think Toy story movies meri favorite Pixar movie hogi. Kya tumne suna wo Toy story Land bana rahe hain Walt Disney World mein this summer?
I did hear that.  It sounds pretty interesting.	maine vaha sunaa.  yeh kaafee dilchasp lagata haye.	Haan maine suna hai. Bahut interesting hoga.
I'm going to WDW in the fall so I'm excited to see how the park is. Have you ever been? Or to Disneyland?	main patjhad mein wdw jaa rhaa huun isaliye main yeh dekhane key liye utsaahit huun kii park kaisa haye. kyaa aap kabhi gaye hain? yaa disneyland key liye?	MAin fall season mein WDW jaa raha hoon isliye excited hoon park dekhne ke liye. Kya tum kbhi gaye ho? Ya Disneyland gaye ho?
I've been to WDW a few times.  Never to Disneyland though.  California is pretty far away from me.  We went camping at WDW last year though.  It was great.	main kuchh baar wdw gayaa huun.  haalaanki disneyland kabhi naheen.  california mujhase kaafee door haye.  haalaanki humm pichale saal wdw mein camping key liye gaye they.  yeh bahut achchha thaa.	Main WDW ek-aadh baar gaya hoon. Disneyland nahee gaya kabhi. California bahoot door hai. Humlog WDW mein camping gaye the pichhle saal.
That's what I'm doing in the fall! I'm really looking forward to camping there!	main patjhad mein yahee curr rhaa huun! main vaastav mein vahaan camping karane key liye utsuk huun!	Wahee to main kar rahaa hoon is fall mein! Main to intezar kar raha hoon wahaan camping ka!
It was really great.  We camped for four nights I think.  It rained like crazy the first day, but it was still fun.	yeh sachmuch bahut badhiya thaa.  mujhe lagata haye kii hamane chaar raaton taka derra daala.  pahale dinn pagalon kii tarah barish hui, lekin phir bhee mazaa aayaa.	Bahut maza aaya tha. Humlog four nights camp kiye the. First day bhayanak baarish hui thi, but fir bhi fun tha.
Do you like Mike or Sulley better?	kyaa aapako mike yaa sule adhik pasand hain?	Tumhe Mike ya Sulley kaun better lagta hai?
Oh good question! I think I like Mike more. He's weirdly optimistic.	oh achchha prashn! mujhe lagata haye kii mujhe mike adhik pasand haye. vaha ajib tarah seey ashawadi haye.	Oh achchhaa sawaal! Mujhe lagta hain ki main Mike ko zyada pasand karta hoon. Wo weirdly optimistic hai.
How about you?	aap kaise hain?	Aur tumhe?
I like Mike because he's funnier.  He had some of the best lines in the first movie.	mujhe mike pasand haye kyonki vaha adhik mazakia haye.  pahali film mein unaki kuchh behtareen panktiyaan theen.	Mujhe Mike pasand kyunki wo zyada funny hai. First movie mein uski lines best thee.
He is SO funny!!	vaha bahut mazakia haye!!	Wo kafi funny hai
I always liked John Goodman's voice acting for Sully, though. It's perfect for a big, fluffy monster	haalaanki, mujhe sulee key liye johnn goodman kii aavaaz hamesha pasand aaee. yeh ack badey, bhulakkad rakshas key liye bilkul upayukt haye	Halaki mujhe Sully mai John Goodman ki voice acting hamesha aachi lagi. Ye bade, fuffy monster ke liye perfect hai
The part at the end of the first movie when he burps out the microphone makes my kids laugh so hard.	pahali film key anta mein vaha hissa jaba vaha dakaar laker microphone bund curr detaa haye, merey bachche bahut hansate hain.	Pehli movie ke end mai jab wo muh se microphone nikalta hai, usse mere bacche bohot zor se haste hein.
I agree. John Goodman was a great choice for Sulley.	main sahmat huun. johnn goodman sule key liye ack behtareen vikalp they.	mai agree karta hun. John Goodman Sulley ke liye behtareen choice tha.
Hahah I bet!!!	hahaha mujhe yakeen haye!!!	hahah shart lagata hun!
I love the scare machine they had in the prequel that the students had to frighten for the contest. That was pretty neat	mujhe prekwal mein unake paas maujood daraane vaali machine bahut pasand haye jise pratiyogita key liye chhaatron koo darana thaa. vaha bahut saaf-suthra thaa	mujhe prequel mai wo darane wali machine pasand hai jise students ko darana tha contest ke liye. Wo kafi saaf tha.
Yeah, though I was really disappointed with Sulley for cheating.	haan, haalaanki main dhokhadhadi key liye sule seey vaastav mein nirash thaa.	han, halaki mai bohot niraash tha Sulley ke cheating karne se
I was too, that broke my heart. I cried when that happened!	main bhee thaa, isase meraa dill toot gayaa. jaba aisaa huaa tou main row padaa!	mai bhi tha, usne mera dil tod diya. Mai roya jab wo hua!
It was really a cruel thing for him to do to MIke	usake liye mike key saath aisaa karna vaastav mein ack kroor baat thee	Ye bohot cruel tha jo Mike ke upar kiya gya
It seemed a little out of character for Sulley, but I guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep the plot moving.	sule key liye yeh thodaa ajib lugg rhaa thaa, lekin mujhe lagata haye kii kathaanak koo aage badhaane key liye unake paas donon key beach sangharsh kaa koee antim srot honah chaahiye.	Ye Sulley ke character se alag lga, par mujhe lagta hai unhe ek aakhiri conflict ka source chahiye tha un dono ke beech plot ko chalate rehne ke liye.
I agree, it was probably my least favorite part of the movie. I feel like they could have taken the story in a different direction.	main sahmat huun, yeh shayed film kaa meraa sabse cumm pasandida hissa thaa. mujhe lagata haye kii way kahani koo ack alag disha mein leey jaa sakate they.	MEIN MAANTHA HOON, YEH THO MERA LEAST FAVORITE PART HEIN IS MOVIE MEIN... MUJE LAGTHA HEIN, KI IS STORY KO ALAG DIRECTION MEIN LEKHE GAYA HEIN
For Sully to trick Mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful!	sulee key liye mike koo dhokha dekar yeh sochana kii vaha daravana haye, bahut dukhad thaa!	SULLY NEI MIKE KO TRICK KAR RAHI THI KI VOH SCARY HEIN, JO BAHUT HURT FUL HEIN
I do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve their dreams though.  That's a good message that Disney started doing with the Princess and the Frog.	mujhe yeh pasand haye kii unhone apane sapnon koo hassil karane key liye itani mehnat kii.  yeh ack achchha sandesh haye jise disney ney rajkumari aur mendhak key saath shuru kiya.	MUJE UNKA DREAM KO ACHIEVE KARNE KE LIYE UNKA WORK BAHUT PASAND HEIN... DISNEY KA ACHE MESSAGE HEIN, VOH THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG SE SHURU KIYE
Me too! I like that common thread between the two movies. I think it was executed better in this though, because they really did start from the very bottom of Monsters, Inch	main bhee! mujhe donon filmon key beach kaa samanya sootra pasand haye. mujhe lagata haye kii isamen ise behtar dhang seey nishpaadit kiya gayaa thaa, kyonki unhone vaastav mein monsters, inch key bahut neeche seey shuruat kii thee	MUJE BHI! MUJE UNKA COMMON THREAD US MOVIES KE BETWEEN PASAND HEIN... KUCH BETTER EXECUTE KIYE HEIN, KYON KI VOH MONSTERS KA BOTTOM SE SHURU HUVA
And it explains why they're always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie.  They were once in that same position.	aur yeh bataata haye kii way mool film mein anya bevakoof chaukidaaron key prati hamesha achche kyon rahate hain.  way ack samay usee sthiti mein they.	AUR VOH EXPLAIN KARTHE KI KYON VOH JANITORS KE SAATH ACHE HEIN IN ORIGINAL MOVIE MEIN.. SAB SAM POSITION MEIN THEY
Oh my gosh!!! I didn't even realize that! I have to rewatch the movie. You're totally right!	oh, merey bhagwan!!! mujhe iska ehsas hii naheen huaa! mujhe film dobara dekhani hogi. aap bilkul sahee hain!	OMG! MUJE REALIZE HI NAHI HUVA! MEIN DUBARA DEKHNA PASAND KARUNGI..
It does show a really good message for kids, to be respectful of everybody	yeh bachchon key liye vaastav mein ack achchha sandesh dikhaata haye, harr kissy kaa sammaan karna	KIDS KE LIYE THO ACHE MESSAGE HEIN, KITNA RESPECTFUL HEIN VOH SABKE SAATH
It's a valuable message.  Be kind and respectful to everyone.  Don't expect to lean on your credentials or family reputation to get you somewhere in life.  Just be prepared to work your hardest.	yeh ack bahumulya sandesh haye.  sabhi key prati dayalu aur sammaanjanak rahein.  yeh apeksha naa karein kii aap jeevan mein aage badhane key liye apani saakh yaa parivarik pratishtha kaa sahaara lenge.  buss apani sabse kadee mehnat karane key liye taiyar rahein.	VALUABLE MESSAGE HEI... SABHI KE LIYE THO KIND AUR RESPECTFUL HEIN.. CREDENTIALS AUR FAMILY REPUTATION KE LIYE THO KABHI LEAN MAT KARO..KAAM HARDEST KE LIYE SIRF ACHE SE PREPARE KARO
Yes! I liked that they showed Sully as this spoiled brat at first who eventually learned that you can't always lean on your family's reputation. It can only get you so far	haan! mujhe achchha lagaa kii unhone shuruat mein sulee koo ack bigdail ladke key roop mein dikhaaya, jisane antatah seekha kii aap hamesha apane parivaar kii pratishtha parr nirbhar naheen reh sakate. yeh aapako kewal itani door taka hii leey jaa sakata haye	HAAN, MUJE PEHELE SULLY KA SPOILED BRAT FIRST PASAND AAYA LEKIN EVENTUALLY JAB USSE LEARN KIYA KI FAMILY REPUTATION KELIYE KABHI LEAN NAHI KARNA CHAHIYE..
Maybe his spoiled background is why he cheated in the competition, because he didn't really realize the consequences of his actions, just did what he thought was right	hoe sakata haye kii usaki kharab prishthabhoomi key kaaran hii usane pratiyogita mein dhokha diyaa hoe, kyonki usey vaastav mein apane kaaryon key parinamon kaa ehsas naheen thaa, usane buss vahee kiya joe usey sahee lagaa.	MAYBE YEH USKA SPOILED BACKGROUND KE VAJE BHI HO SAKTHA, JO COMPETITION KE LIYE CHEAT KIYA HEIN.. KYONKI VOH ACTIONS KE CONSEQUENCES KO REALIZE HI NAHI HOTA,
I feel like a lot of kids need that message these days.	mujhe lagata haye kii aajkal bahut saare bachchon koo usa sandesh kii zaroorat haye.	MUJE FEEL HOTA KI AAJKAL KAHI KIDS KO MESSAGE CHAHIYE
You've got a good point there about the cheating.	dhokhadhadi key baare mein aapke paas ack achchi baat haye.	HAAN AAP SAHI HEIN, VOH CHEATING KE BAARE MEIN HEIN
And you have a good point there about kids needing that message!	aur aapke paas yeh achchi baat haye kii bachchon koo usa sandesh kii aavashyakta haye!	AUR AAP SAHI HEIN, AAJ KAL KA KIDS KO KAAFI MESSAGE NEED HEIN
I like that they had to work hard together too, so it didn't feel like so much of a struggle. Because Mike and Sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up the corporate ladder	mujhe achchha lagaa kii unhein saath milkar bhee kadee mehnat karni padee, isaliye itna sangharsh naheen lagaa. kyonki mike aur sulee koo corporate seedhi parr aage badhane key usa sangharsh mein ack-dusare koo saajha karna thaa	MUJE UNKA WORK TOGETHER PASAND HEIN, LEKIN UNKA STRUGGLE ITNA BHI PASAND NAHI HEIN, KYONKI MIKE AUR SULLY THO AAPAAS MEIN APNE KAAM SHARE KARTEH JO CORPORATE KA LADDER ACHEIVE KARNE MEIN KAAM AATHA

Not yet, have you?	abhee taka naheen, kyaa aapke paas haye?	abhi nahi, kya tumne?
It is written and directed by Christopher Nolan.	ise christopher nolan ney likhaa aur nirdeshit kiya haye.	Isko likha or nirdeshit kiya hai christopher Nolan ne.
I have not, but I am very interested.	merey paas naheen haye, lekin mujhe bahut dilchaspi haye.	mere pass nahi, par mujhe bahut ruchi hai.
I did notknow he wrote it.	mujhe naheen pataa thaa kii usane ise likhaa haye.	mujhe nahi mahul  usne likha hai.
He filmed it on a unique format film stock as well, so it's especially suited for something like an IMAX experience	unhone ise ack anoothe praaroop key film stock parr bhee filmaya, isaliye yeh vishesh roop seey imax anubhav jaisi kissy cheez key liye upayukt haye	ye philam ek alag format mei hai to ye bahut he vishesh hai IMAX anubhave hai
I wonder if it is still in theaters?	mujhe ashcharya haye kii kyaa yeh abhee bhee cinemagharon mein haye?	mujhe ashcharya hai ki abhi bhi ye cinemaghar mei hai?
It came  out a while back now.	abhee kuchh samay pahale yeh saamane aayaa.	kuch der pahale ye bahar aaya hai.
I think..	mujhe lagata haye..	mene shocha..
I do not think so. And without it, there are several critical responses as well because it does not have any sentimentality	mujhe aisaa naheen lagata. aur isake binaa bhee kaee aalochanatmak pratikriyaaen aatee hain kyonki isamen koee bhavukta naheen haye	mai aisa nahi sochta. aur without iske bhi yaha par kuch critical responses bhi hai because isme koi bhi sentimentality nahi hai
Oh so are you saying some critics didn't like  it?	oh, tou kyaa aap kaha rahey hain kii kuchh alochakon koo yeh pasand naheen aayaa?	Oh so aap yah kah rahe ho ki kuch critics ne bhi ise pasand nahi kiya?

Both overwhelming in the cinimatics while not providing any one character to get attached to	donon hii cinemai drishti seey jabardast hain, lekin kissy ack kirdar seey judane kaa avsar naheen dete hain	cinimatics me dono overwhelming hai par bina kisi character se attach kiye bina
Probably more driven by the action.	sambhavatah kaarravaai seey adhik prerit.	probably sab kuch action se hi drive ho raha.
It is about a nearly impossible evacuation, and you see all three types of assistance - naval, air, and land	yeh lagbhag asambhav nikasi key baare mein haye, aur aap teenon prakaar kii sahaayata dekhate hain - nausena, vayu aur bhoomi	yah ek nearly impossible evacuation ke baare me hai, aur aapko teeno type ke assistance dekhne ko milte hai - naval, air aur land
It is based on what truly happened at dunkirk, right?	yeh vaastav mein dunkirk mein joe huaa usa parr adharit haye, haye naa?	yah dunkirk me asal me kya hua tha us par aadharit hai, right
Yes. It is very true to the story.	haan. yeh kahani bilkul sach haye.	Yes. yah true story ke bahut nazdeek hai
I am always hesitant to see very  real war related movies.	main hamesha yuddh seey sambandhit vaastavik filmein dekhane seey jhijhakta huun.	mai hamesha hesitant tha asli war related movies ko lekar.
It is a lot to handle.	ise sambhalana bahut haye.	isme bahut kutch handle karna hai.
There are a few characters who get names, like Mr. Dawson and his sons Peter and George, who set out on a boat to help, but few characters who get followed throughout	aise kuchh paatr hain jinhen naam milate hain, jaise mister dosson aur unake bete peater aur george, joe madad key liye naav parr nikale, lekin kuchh paatr aise hain jinka poore samay peechha kiya jaataa haye	Usme kutch character hain jisenaam mila hai jaise MR.Dawson aur uska beta Peter aur George  jo boat nikal kar help karne gaye aur sab character just unko follow kiye.
So very different from nolan's batman.	nolan key batman seey bahut alag.	Isliye yeh bahut alag hai nolan's batman se.
Very much so. While it seems Dunkirk may have been a technical success, you do not walk away feeling like it	bahut jyada tou. haalaanki aisaa lagata haye kii dunkirk ack takniki safalata rahee hogi, aap aisaa mahsoos karke naheen chalenge	Haan sahi hai.lag raha hai Dunkirk sayad technically success hai , tum yeh man kar walk way nahi kar sakte.KO
Any known actors in dunkirk?	dunkirk mein koee gyaat abhineta?	Koi known actor hai kya dunkrik mein?
There is commander Bolton, who confirms that the 300,000 have been evacuated. It was ten times more than had been hoped for	commander bolton hain, joe pushti karate hain kii 300,000 logon koo nikaal liya gayaa haye. yeh aasha seey duss gunaa adhik thaa	Commander Bolton ne confirm kya ki 300,000 evacuate kar chuke hai joki 10 times jyada hai jitna hune ummed ki thi.
Who plays him?	usey kaun nibhaata haye?	Kaun use khila raha hai?
Mr Dawson gets acknowledgement for having saved so many men	shree dosson koo itane saare logon koo bachaane key liye sweekriti milati haye	Mr Dawson ko acknowledgement mila itne logo ko save karne ke liye.
Hmmm.. That I do not know	hammm.. voe mujhe naheen pataa	Hmmm.. Mujhe yeh pata nahi tha.
These names are unknown to me.	yeye naam merey liye agyaat hain.	Yeh name mere liye unknown hai.
Ahh, I do see it here. Does Aneurin Barnard ring a bell?	aaha, main ise yahaan dekhta huun. kyaa aneurine bernard ghanti bajaata haye?	Ahh, main ise yahaan dekhata hoon. kya Aneurin barnard ek ghantee bajaata hai?
Hmm , no.	humm, naheen.	hmm, nahi
I am surprised there is no big name star.	mujhe ashcharya haye kii koee badaa naami sitara naheen haye.	Mujhe surprise  hai ki koee bada naam sitaara nahin hai.
I'm looking at the list of the biggest roles, and they are not stars. But that goes with the anonymity of all of the characters really	main sabse badee bhoomikaon kii soochi dekh rhaa huun, aur way sitaare naheen hain. lekin yeh vaastav mein sabhi paatron kii gumnami key saath judaa huaa haye	Main sabase badee bhoomikaon kee soochee dekh raha hoon, aur ve sitaare nahin hain. lekin yah vaastav mein sabhee characters ke gumanaamee ke saath jaata hai
Maybe it is a comment on war itself.	shayed yeh yuddh parr hii ack tippani haye.	Shaayad yah yuddh par hee ek tippanee hai.
Hehe, I see it of course ends with an article being read, written by Churchill.	hehe, main dekhta huun kii yeh nishchit roop seey churchill dwara likhe gaye ack lekh koo padhane key saath samaapt hotaa haye.	Hehe, main dekhata hoon ki yah churchlil dvaara likha gaya ek lekh padha ja raha hai.
So many movies and shows involving Churchill lately!	haal hii mein churchill seey judee bahut saaree filmein aur show!	Bahut saaree movies aur shows me churchill haal hee mein shaamil!

though they took forever to make those ones... or at least waited forever	haalaanki unhein banaane mein unhein kaafee samay lugg gayaa... yaa cumm seey cumm hamesha intazaar karna padaa	kuch tho aise hi bana dethe hey aur kuch tho wait karte ache movies ke liye
I personally liked the dark knight movies way more	mujhe vyaktigat roop seey dark night filmein adhik pasand aaeen	mein personally is dark knight movies ko pasand kartha
especially the first one	visheshkar pahala vaalaa	especially voh first one ko
yeah, they didnt do a very good job of connecting the storylines	haan, unhone kahaaniyon koo jodane kaa bahut achchha kaam naheen kiya	haan, voh tho storyline se connect karne me itna ache job nahi karte
and christian bale wasnt my fav batman either	aur christian bell bhee meraa pasandida batman naheen thaa	aur christian bale tho mera batman ka fav bhi nahi hein
i don't think too many people like him as batman honestly	imandari seey kahoon tou mujhe naheen lagata kii bahut seey loga unhein batman key roop mein pasand karate hain	muje nahi lagtha ki kaafi logo is liye batman ko pasand hein

Who stars in the movie?	film mein kaun kalakar hain?	Is movie mein stars kaun hai?
Ryan Gosling, Emma stone, and John Legend	rayan gosling, emma stone, aur johnn leasand	Ryan Roseling, Emma Stne aur John Legend
I like Ryan Gosling. He is a good actor, but I heard that it was a musical. Is that correct?	mujhe rayan gosling pasand haye. vaha ack achche abhineta hain, lekin maine sunaa haye kii yeh ack sangeetmay film thee. kyaa vaha sahee haye?	Mujhe Ryan Roseling pasand hai. Woh ek achhe actor hai par maine suna hai yeh musical hai.Sahi hai kya?
Yes, it is a musical romatic comedy! It has the best off all the things that make you feel good! Romance,and comedy.	haan, yeh ack sangeetmay romantic comedy haye! isamen way sabhi cheezen sarvottam hain joe aapako achchha mahsoos karaati hain! romans, aur comedy.	Haan. yeh  comedy . musical romantic Sabse acchi baat yeh hai ki , iame ramance aur comedy aapko accha feel karata hai.
I cannot imagine Ryan Gosling in a musical, but I guess it could work.	main sangeet mein rayan gosling kii kalpana naheen curr sakata, lekin mujhe lagata haye kii yeh kaam curr sakata haye.	Mein Ryan Roseling ko musical movie mein soch hi nahi sakta lekin asha karta hoon ki yeh chal jaye.
Where does the movie take place?	film kahaan hoti haye?	Yeh movie kahan pe lee gayi hai.
He plays as the Jazz pianist, and he falls in love with Emma Stone. It takes place in Los Angeles.	vaha jaiz piyanovadak key roop mein bajaata haye aur usey emma stone seey pyaar hoe jaataa haye. yeh loss angils mein hotaa haye.	Woh ek jazz pianist ka role karte hai aur Emma stone se love karne lagte hain. Yeh Los Angeles mein lee gayi hai.
Is Emma Stone playing an artist also?	kyaa emma stone bhee ack kalakar kii bhoomika nibha rahee hain?	Kya Emma stone  bhi ek artist ka role nibha rahi hai?
She is a aspiting actress in this film. They are both pursuing their dreams.	iss film mein vaha ack mahatvakankshi abhinetri hain. way donon apane sapnon kaa peechha curr rahey hain.	Woh ek akankshi actress ki role nibha rahi hai. Dono apne apne sapnon do sach karne mein lagte hai.
What part does John Legend play?	johnn leasand ney kaun see bhoomika nibhai haye?	John Legend kaa role kya hai?
I am not sure what part he pays. In the first part Ryan Gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of I Ran (So far Away), he feels like the song is an isult for a serious musician	mujhe yakeen naheen haye kii vaha kiss hisse kaa bhugtan kartaa haye. pahale bhaag mein rayan gosling ack party mein hain aur vaha aaee raine (sou phaar away) kaa cover bajaate hain, unhein lagata haye kii yeh gaanaa ack gambhir sangeetkaar kaa upman haye	Mujhe sure nhi hai ki usne konsa part play kiya tha. Pehle part mein Ryan Gosling ek part pe tha or usne I ran (ab tak door) ka cover play kiya tha, wo song aisa lag rha tha ki ek serous musician ki insult ki ho.
What is the time period of the movie? Is it a modern story?	film kii samayaavadhi kyaa haye? kyaa yeh ack aadhunik kahani haye?	Movie ka time period kya hai? kay yeh ek modern story hai?
Yes I think it is modern time period	haan, mujhe lagata haye kii yeh aadhunik samay haye	Han mujhe lagta hai ki modern time period hai
Have you seen the movie?	kyaa aap movie dekh chuke hain?	Kya tumne movie dekhi hai?
No I have not seen it yet, I want to though. I want to know if they stay together or they have a struggle with their relationship	naheen, maine ise abhee taka naheen dekhaa haye, phir bhee main dekhana chaahata huun. main jaanana chaahata huun kii kyaa way saath rahate hain yaa unhein apane rishte koo laker koee pareshani haye	Nhi maine abhi tak nhi dekhi, jabki main chahta tha. Main janna chahta tha ki wo saath mein rehne lgte hain ya wo relationship ke saath struggle hi krte reh jate hai.
Relationships are tough. I wonder how the two characters handle theirs.	rishte kathin hain. mujhe ashcharya haye kii donon kirdar apane kirdaaron koo kaise sambhaalate hain.	Relationships mushkil hote hai. Mujhe suprising lgta hai ki kaise dono characters sambhaal lete hai.
Emma who plays Mia, writes her own one women play. That sound interesting! Ryan who is playing Sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together. I am thinking they sound like a fun couple.	miya kaa kirdar nibhaane vaali emma apana khud kaa ack mahila naatak likhati hain. yeh dilchasp lagata haye! rayan joe sebastian kaa kirdar nibha rhaa haye, ack club mein niyamit pradarshan curr rhaa haye aur way ack saath rahate hain. main soch rhaa huun kii way ack mazedaar jodee kii tarah lugg rahey hain.	Emma jo Mia ka role play kr rhi hai, usne one women play likha hai. Ye sunne mein interesting lagta hai! Ryan jo ki Sebastian is role play kr rha hai club pe or wo ikhathe rehne lagte hai. Mujhe lagta hai ki ye ek fun couple ki tarah lag rhe hai.
Do you know what the play is about?	kyaa aap jaanate hain kii naatak kiss baare mein haye?	Tumhe pta hai ki play kis baare mein hai.
No, sadly I do not know what it is about. I do know that Sebastian does not enjoy the music his band plays in	naheen, dukh kii baat haye kii mujhe naheen pataa kii yeh kiss baare mein haye. main jaanata huun kii sebastian koo apane baind kaa sangeet pasand naheen haye	Nhi, afsos mujhe nhi pta ki yeh kis baare mein hai. Mujhe yeh pta hai Sebastian apne band mein bajaye jane wale music ko pasand nhi krta.

New York in that time was amazing city ,full with class	usa samay newyork adbhut shahar thaa, class seey bharpur	us time pe tho newyork badiya city hein, full with class
Indeed, but perhaps Gatsby himself reminds us that shallow shows of wealth are no compensation for human misery	vaastav mein, lekin shayed gatsby swayam hamein yaad dilaate hain kii dhana kaa uthala pradarshan maanviya dukhon kaa muaavaja naheen haye	indeed, lekin perhaps gatsby tho hame reminds karthe ki wealth ka showoff itna shallow hein jo kabhi human misery ka koi compensation nahi kartha
Its interesting how such a richly written character can also work as an allegory in that way	yeh dilchasp haye kii itna samriddh roop seey likhaa gayaa charitra usa tarah seey ack roopak key roop mein bhee kaam curr sakata haye	interesting hein, lekin yeh thoda richly character ko likha hein jo allegory se kaam karthe is tarah

Do you like Monsters University?	kyaa aapako monsters university pasand haye?	aapko monsters university pasand hein?
I do, I thought Billy did a good job as Mike	main kartaa huun, mujhe lagaa kii billy ney mike key roop mein achchha kaam kiya haye	muje bhi, muje laga billy ne mike ka acha job kiya
Yeah Billy Crystal is great. Who is your favorite character?	haan billy chrystal mahaan haye. aapka pasandida charitra kaun haye?	haan, billy crystal tho great hein, tho aapka favorite character kon hein?
Mike was. Monster U is cute and funny and the animation, though not exactly inspired, has a lot of color.	mike thaa. monster yuu pyaara aur mazedaar haye aur animation, halanki bilkul prerit naheen haye, isamen bahut saare rung hain.	mike yar... monster u tho cute aur funny animation hein, lakin itna bhi inspired nahi hein, unme kahi saara color toh hein
I really liked all the comedy in it. And the music	mujhe isaki saaree comedy bahut pasand aaee. aur sangeet	muje us movie ka comedy bahut pasand hein.. unka music bhi
The comedy is true to the spirit of Monsters Inc and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over old ground. The music hit all the right notes I think	comedy monsters ink kii bhavna key anuroop haye aur usake swar seey mell khaati haye, lekin kabhi bhee purani sthiti koo badalane mein santusht naheen dikhi. mujhe lagata haye kii sangeet ney sabhi sahee swaron koo hitt kiya	music tho right notes pe hit hein.... comedy tho sahi mein spirit of monsters inc hein aur unka tone bhi match kartha, lekin kabhi old ground nahi hota
I agree, it was a very safe bet for Pixar with how they presented it.	main sahmat huun, jiss tarah seey unhone ise prastut kiya, pixer key liye yeh ack bahut hii surakshit shart thee.	mein maantha hoon, safe hein pixar se bet karne, jo itna ache present jo kiya
Superstar actors doing voice acting is always going to make money, though.	haalaanki, voyce acting karane vaale superstar abhineta hamesha paisa kamaane vaale hotey hain.	Superstar actors jab voice acting karte hai to ye hamesha hi money making hota hai. though
I agree, it has enough stuff to haunt the imagination long after the immediate buzz of cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a good result.	main sahmat huun, isamen cuteness kii tatkaal charcha khatm hoe jaane key baad lambe samay taka kalpana koo pareshan karane key liye paryaapt samagri haye. maatr prekwal key liye, yeh ack achchha parinam haye.	I agree, isme enough stuff hai jo imigantion ko haunt karte hai uske baad bhi jab cuteness ka immediate buzz melt away ho gaya. sirf ek prequel ke liye, yah badhiya result hai.
I liked the whole fraternity aspect of it, very tongue in cheek.	mujhe iska puuraa bhaichara vaalaa pahalu bahut pasand aayaa, bahut zor seey gaal bajaana.	mujhe wo whole fraternity aspect bahut pasand aaya, bahutn tongue in cheek tha.
Yes, it was a refreshing outlook on the series as a whole and provided a nice background for the characters.	haan, yeh poori shrinkhala parr ack taazaa drishtikon thaa aur paatron key liye ack achchi prishthabhoomi pradaan kii.	yes, ye bahut refreshing outlook hai as a whole series and characters ke liye ek nice background bhi provide kiya isne.
I thought the scene of Mike at 7 years old was a good call-back too.	mujhe lagaa kii 7 saal kii umr mein mike kaa drishya bhee ack achchha coll-back thaa.	I thought wo Mike ka scene jab wo 7 years old tha wo bhi ek badhiya call-back tha.
I agree, I liked when they show Mike's background story of why he became a scarer. I always wondered why he chose to do that	main sahmat huun, mujhe achchha lagaa jaba unhone mike kii prishthabhoomi kii kahani dikhaai kii vaha kyon daravana bunn gayaa. mujhe hamesha ashcharya hotaa thaa kii usane aisaa karna kyon chunaa	i agree, maine like kiya jab wo Mike ki background story dikhate hain wo kyon ek scarer bana gaya. maine always wonder kiya hai ki usne aisa kyon chuna
I also like how they show the friendship between Mike and Sully develop	mujhe yeh bhee pasand haye kii way kaise dikhaate hain kii mike aur sulee key beach dosti vikasit hui haye	mujhe wo bhi bahut achcah laga jab wo Mike aur Sully ki friendship develop hote hue show karte hai.
Yeah I never thought of Sully as the cool guy iike that	haan, maine sulee koo usa tarah kaa achchha ladka kabhi naheen socha thaa	yes maine kabhi Sully ko as the cool guy ke roop me nahi socha tha.
I didn't know Sully had such a pretentious  background compared to other characters. It explains why only he was accepted into Roar Omega Roar.	mujhe naheen pataa thaa kii anya kirdaaron kii tulana mein sulee kii prishthabhoomi itani dikhaavati haye. yeh bataata haye kii kewal unhein hii ror omega ror mein kyon sweekar kiya gayaa.	mujhe nahi malum tha ki Sully ka itna pretentious background tha dusre characters ke compare me. isse explain hota hai ki kyon use Roar Omega Roar me accept kiya tha.
True, and it does do a good job of showing how both characters are flawed.	sach haye, aur yeh yeh dikhaane kaa achchha kaam kartaa haye kii kaise donon paatr trutipurna hain.	True, and isne bahut badhiya job kiya ye dikhane me kaise dono characters flawed hai.
I thought the whole Scare Games plot was a fairly good one too, kept it interesting.	mujhe lagaa kii sampoorn scare games kaa kathaanak bhee kaafee achchha thaa, ise dilchasp banaae rakhaa.	maine socha whole Scare Games plot bhi kafi acha tha, interesting bana ke rakha isne
I agree, I like that they didn't try to make them perfect.	main sahmat huun, mujhe yeh pasand haye kii unhone unhein poorn banaane kii koshish naheen kii.	I agree, mujhe acha laga ke unhone isey perfect banaane ka try nahi kiya
Yes! And so much was at stake for them in that game as well	haan! aur usa khel mein bhee unake liye bahut kuchh daanv parr lagaa thaa	Han! Aur unke liye bhi itna kuch stake pe tha game mein
It would decide if they could be renerolled or not. How do you feel about how Sully cheated?	isamen taya kiya jaayega kii unaka dobara namankan kiya jaa sakata haye yaa naheen. aap kaisa mahsoos karate hain kii sulee ney kaise dhokha diyaa?	wo ye decide karta ki wo reneroll ho sakte hai ki nahi. Jis tarah se Sully ne cheat kiya tumhe kaisa laga
I thought it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment.	maine socha kii yeh apariharya mein deree curr rhaa haye aur unhein upalabdhi kaa jhoothaa ehsas dilaa rhaa haye.	Mujhe laga ye inevitable ko delay karna tha aur unhe false sense of accomplishment dena tha.
I agree, I felt bad for Mike who thought he succeeded on his own terms but instead was helped to win	main sahmat huun, mujhe mike key liye buraa lagaa jisane socha kii vaha apani sharton parr safal huaa lekin isake bajaay usey jeetane mein madad kii gaee	.I agree, mujhe Mike ke liye bura laga jisne socha wo jeet gay apne terms par par usey jitaya gaya tha
I thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first challenge because another team was diqualified for cheating.	maine socha kii yeh bhee vidambanapurna haye kyonki way kewal pahali chunauti seey baahar hoe jaate hain kyonki doosari team koo dhokhadhadi key liye ayogya ghoshit curr diyaa gayaa thaa.	Mujhe bhi ye ironic laga kyunki wo sirf first challenge se eliminate huye kyunki dusri team cheating ke liye disqualify ho gayi
Yes I agree. It ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as well	haan main sahmat huun. isake parinamswarup unhein vishvavidyalaya seey bhee nishkaasit curr diyaa gayaa	Han I agree. Isne unhe university se expel hone ke liye bhi cause kar diya
I feel like they sacrificed themselves for the rest of the fraternity to get accepted though.	mujhe aisaa lagata haye jaise unhone baaki biradari mein sweekar kiye jaane key liye khud koo balidan curr diyaa.	mujhe laga unhone khud ko sacrifice kia taki baki fraternity accept ho sake
I agree and I think that it was a noble thing to do. At least they still were able to be hired at Monsters, Inc. and work their way up to becoming scarers.	main sahmat huun aur mujhe lagata haye kii yeh ack neck kaam thaa. cumm seey cumm way abhee bhee monsters, ink. mein kaam parr rakhane aur daraavane vyakti banane kii disha mein kaam karane mein saksham they.	I agree aur main sochta hu ye ek noble thing thi karne ke liye. Kam se kam wo fir bhi able they Monsters, Inc. pe hire hone ke liye aur scarers banne tak upar pahunh jaate hain
Yeah, guess it shows that you don't need education sometime! Haha.	haan, anuman haye kii isase pataa chalata haye kii aapako kabhi-kabhi shiksha kii aavashyakta naheen hoti haye! haaha.	ha. yesha lagata hai ki aap ko education nahi chaliye haha
Exactly, sometimes all that's needed is preservation  and hardwork!	bilkul, kabhi-kabhi kewal sanrakshan aur kadee mehnat kii aavashyakta hoti haye!	sach mei, ham sab ko kabhi hard work or preservation ki jarurat hoti hai!
At least they didn't get in a lot of trouble with the CDA	cumm seey cumm unhein cda seey bahut pareshani naheen hui	achcha hai unko CDA mei bahut jayada trouble nahi hua
Yeah I was taken aback when Hardscrabble said they were the first students to surprise her.	haan, jaba hardscrable ney kahaa kii way usey aashcharyachakit karane vaale pahale chhaatr they tou main aashcharyachakit reh gayaa.	haa. meine wapas leliya jab Hardscrabble ne kaha ki we first student the surprise ko
I agree, I thought they weren't too special. All in all it was a great movie!	main sahmat huun, mujhe lagaa kii way bahut khaas naheen they. kull milakar yeh ack behtareen film thee!	I agree, mei ne socha vo bahut special hai. ye ek great movie hai!

The Blind Side is a 2009 American biographical sports drama film written and directed by John Lee Hancock, based on the Book The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game by Michael Lewis.

As an historical drama there was little chance for a cliffhanger. So it ended well.	ack aitihaasik naatak key roop mein cliffhanger key liye bahut cumm sambhavana thee. tou iska anta achchha huaa.	Kyuki wo historical drama hai usme thoda chance tha cliffhanger ka. To wo acchi end hui
That's good. Do you feel that all the characters were well developed?	achchi baat haye. kyaa aapako lagata haye kii sabhi paatr achchi tarah vikasit kiye gaye they?	Accha. Kya tumhe lagta hai sabhi characters well developed the?
No. The "Gibson" character could have been better developed.	naheen, "gibson" charitra koo behtar dhang seey vikasit kiya jaa sakata thaa.	nahi. 'Gibson' character thoda aur develop kiya jaa sakta tha
What about casting choices?

Yes. Not only in the military side, but also in regards to the characterization of civilian life.	haan. naa kewal sainya paksh mein, balki nagrik jeevan key charitra-chitran key sambandh mein bhee.	Han, Na sirf military side par, lekin civilian life ke characterization ke hisaab se bhi

so yes I am interested	tou haan mujhe dilchaspi haye	Ha me interested hu
I wonder why there is a gap in the Rotton Tomatoes score and the Metacritic score for Wonder Woman	mujhe ashcharya haye kii rotten tomatose score aur wonder women key metacritic score mein antar kyon haye	I wonder Rotten Tomatoes score aur Metacritic score me Wonder Woman k liye itna gap kyu hai
hello! that is very strange, maybe they have different audiences, did you originally see this as a war movie? I guess i personally separate war movies from super hero movies	namaste! yeh bahut ajib haye, hoe sakata haye kii unake alag-alag darshak houn, kyaa aapane ise mool roop seey ack yuddh film key roop mein dekhaa thaa? mujhe lagata haye kii main vyaktigat roop seey yuddh filmon koo super hiro filmon seey alag kartaa huun	hello! ye kaafi strange hai, maybe unki different audience hai, kya tumne originally ise war movie type se dekha? I guess personally main war movies aur super hero movies ko seperate karta hu.
I do that too, I think of them both as different genres, even though Wonder Woman was set during World War 1.	main bhee aisaa kartaa huun, main una donon koo alag-alag shailiyon key roop mein sochata huun, bhale hii wonder women pratham vishva yuddh key dauran sett kii gaee thee.	main bhi wahi karta hu. Main dono ko alag genre maanta hu , bhale hi Wonder Woman World War 1 k duaran set thi.
Yeah I could see them grouping it together, I just usually separate them, I enjoy the actors though, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are great, how did you feel about their choices?	haan, main unhein ack saath samoohit hotey hue dekh sakata huun, main aamtaur parr unhein alag kartaa huun, haalaanki main abhinetaon kaa anand letaa huun, galle gadot aur criss pine mahaan hain, aapako unaki pasand key baare mein kaisa lagaa?	Haan, main unhen ek saath samoohabaddh karate hue dekh sakata tha, main aamataur par unhen alag karata hoon, main actors ka aanand leta hoon haalaanki, gal gadot aur chris pine mahaan hain, aapako unakee pasand ke baare mein kaisa laga?
I thought the casting was great, even though this was the first time I ever heard of Gal Gadot.	mujhe lagaa kii casting badhiya thee, bhale hii maine pahali baar galle gadot key baare mein sunaa thaa.	Mujhe laga ki kaasting bahut achchhee thee, haalaanki yah pahalee baar tha jab mainne gal gadot ke baare mein suna.
I was shocked though it was so well received with cirtics considering its a DC film haha, usually Marvel runs the place	main aashcharyachakit thaa, haalaanki ise alochakon dwara itani achchi tarah seey saraha gayaa thaa kii yeh ack dc film haye, haaha, aamtaur parr marval iss jagah koo chalaata haye	Haalaanki main hairaan tha ki yah ek dc movie haaha ko dekhate hue sirtiks ke saath bahut achchhee tarah se praapt hua tha, aamataur par marvel jagah chalaata hai
I agree. I think one of the reasons it was well received was because Wonder Woman was trying to end the war, instead of contributing to a growing conflict.	main sahmat huun. mujhe lagata haye kii ise achchi tarah seey sweekar kiye jaane kaa ack kaaran yeh thaa kii wonder women badhate sangharsh mein yogdan dene key bajaay yuddh koo samaapt karane kii koshish curr rahee thee.	Main sahamat hoon. mujhe lagata hai ki isaka ek kaaran yah tha ki ise achchhee tarah se praapt kiya gaya tha kyonki wonder woman badhate sangharsh mein yogadaan dene ke bajaay yuddh ko samaapt karane kee koshish kar rahee thee.
yeah, a lot of the marvel movies tend to just make up a conflict and then go with it instead of going off an existing one. I enjoyed it though, It is interesting the difference in opinions though, I don't know if I would see a second one	haan, bahut see adbhut filmein sirf ack takraav paida karati hain aur phir maujooda vivaad koo khatm karane key bajaay usake saath chully jaati hain. haalaanki maine iska anand liya, haalaanki vichaaron mein antar dilchasp haye, mujhe naheen pataa kii main doosara dekh paauunga yaa naheen	Haan, bahut see marvel movies sirph ek sangharsh karane ke lie hotee hain aur phir ek maujooda band hone ke bajaay isake saath jaatee hain. mainne haalaanki isaka aanand liya, haalaanki yah raay mein antar dilachasp hai, mujhe nahin pata ki kya main ek doosare ko dekhoonga
I think if Patty Jenkins directs a sequel, it would be as good as the first one. She did a great job with this movie.	mujhe lagata haye kii aggar patty jenkins agali kadee kaa nirdeshan karenge tou yeh pahali film jitani hii achchi hogi. iss film mein unhone bahut achchha kaam kiya.	mujhe lagata hai ki agar patty jenkins ek seekval ka nirdeshan karatee hai, to yah pahale vaale kee tarah achchha hoga iss movie ke saath unhonne bahut achchha kaam kiya.
thats true, if they can keep the cast and crew together I think the chances of it being a hit increase. I believe thats more then 3 exchanges we've had about the movie now	yeh sach haye, aggar way kalakaron aur cru koo ack saath rakh sakate hain tou mujhe lagata haye kii isake hitt honey kii sambhavana badh jaati haye. meraa maanana ​​haye kii hamane abb taka film key baare mein teen seey adhik baar baatchit kii haye	Yah sach hai, agar ve kalaakaaron aur chaalak dal ko ek saath rakh sakate hain to mujhe lagata hai ki yah ek hit virddhi kee sambhaavana hai. mera maanana ​​hai ki 3 se adhik eksachenjon ke baad ab hamane movie ke baare mein socha hai
The document just updated for me. One of the things that caught my eye of the movie is how the time period was depicted, especially with how Princess Diana received a photographic plate whereas now we can take selfies. It is an interesting disconnect.	dastaavez abhee merey liye adyatan kiya gayaa haye. film mein ack cheej jisane merrie najar kheenchi vaha yeh haye kii samay avadhi koo kaise darshaaya gayaa haye, khaskar rajkumari dyna koo ack photographic plate kaise millie, jabaki abb humm selfi leey sakate hain. yeh ack dilchasp disconnect haye.	Dastaavez sirph mere lie apadet kiya gaya. movie kee meree nazar mein aane vaalee cheejon mein se ek yah hai ki samay avadhi ko kaise chitrit kiya gaya tha, khaasakar Princess Diana ko photographic plet kaise milee, jabaki ab ham selphee le sakate hain. yah ek dilachasp disconnect hai.
Oh mine just updated too, sorry about that. I think thats interesting and a good period for the film, I think the mythology involved behind it was very intriguing	oh, meraa bhee abhee-abhee update huaa haye, isake liye kshama karein. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh dilchasp aur film key liye ack achchha samay haye, mujhe lagata haye kii isake peechhe shamil pauraanik kathaa bahut dilchasp thee	Oh mera bhee adyatan kiya gaya, is baare mein kshama karen. mujhe lagata hai ki movie kelie dilachasp aur ek achchhee avadhi hai, mujhe lagata hai ki isake peechhe shaamil pauraanik katha bahut pecheeda thee
I agree. Usually whenever Greek or Roman mythology is presented in a movie it is dense and opaque, but it was easily understood in Wonder Woman.	main sahmat huun. aamtaur parr jaba bhee greek yaa roman pauraanik kathaon koo kissy film mein prastut kiya jaataa haye tou vaha saghan aur apaardarshi hoti haye, lekin wonder women mein ise aasaani seey samajha jaa sakata haye.	Main sahamat hoon. aamataur par jab bhee kisee philm mein greek ya roman pauraanik kathaon ko prastut kiya jaata hai to vah ghanee aur apaaradarshee hotee hai, lekin wonder woman mein yah aasaanee se samajh mein aa gaya.
Yeah introducing concepts like that can definitely be hard to follow sometimes depending on how they're presented. It's interesting that zues chose amazonian warriors to protect mankind	haan, iss tarah kii avadhaaranaon koo prastut karna kabhi-kabhi nishchit roop seey kathin hoe sakata haye, yeh iss baat parr nirbhar kartaa haye kii unhein kaise prastut kiya gayaa haye. yeh dilchasp haye kii zooz ney maanav jaati kii raksha key liye amazonian yoddhaon koo chunaa	haan, is tarah kee avadhaaranaon ko pesh karana nishchit roop se kabhee-kabhee paalan karane ke lie kathin ho sakata hai ki ve kaise prastut karate hain. yah dilachasp hai ki zoo ne maanav jaati kee raksha ke lie amejan yoddhaon ko chuna
The way Ares was punished was also interesting, with only Zeus able to wound him in the battle.	jiss tarah seey eres koo dandit kiya gayaa vaha bhee dilchasp thaa, kewal zius hii usey yuddh mein ghayal karane mein saksham thaa.	jis tarah se eres ko dandit kiya gaya tha vah bhee dilachasp tha, keval zeus ne use ladaee mein ghaayal karane mein saksham kiya.
I liked that it was only them left, zues and ares had to fight to save mankind, it made it interesting with it being in a time period where the first time in history we had a world war	mujhe achchha lagaa kii yeh tabhi bachaa thaa, zius aur eres koo maanav jaati koo bachaane key liye ladana thaa, isane ise usa samay avadhi mein dilchasp banaa diyaa jaba itihas mein pahali baar hamaare paas vishva yuddh huaa thaa	mujhe yah pasand aaya ki yah keval vaam, zeus aur eres ko maanav jaati ko bachaane ke lie ladana tha, isane ise us samay ke saath dilachasp bana diya jahaan itihaas mein pahalee baar hamane vishv yuddh kiya tha
I thought it was interesting that the American pilot crashed near south America, connecting World War 1 to the Amazonian setting was done very well in the film in my opinion.	mujhe lagaa kii yeh dilchasp haye kii americi pilot dakshin america key paas durghatanagrast hoe gayaa, merrie raay mein pratham vishva yuddh koo amazonian setting seey jodana film mein bahut achchi tarah seey kiya gayaa thaa.	mujhe laga ki yah dilachasp tha ki american chalak dakshin american ke paas durghatanaagrast ho gaya, pratham vishv yuddh ko amozon se jodakar meree raay mein philm mein bahut achchha kaam kiya gaya.
yeah it seems they did a very good job of having the plot points connect with real world situations, the island then being invaded by the germans looking to advance their warfare technology really gives you a sense of good side/bad side	haan, aisaa lagata haye kii unhone kathaanak key binduon koo vaastavik duniya kii sthitiyon seey jodane kaa bahut achchha kaam kiya haye, dweep parr taba germans dwara aakraman kiya jaa rhaa haye joe apani yuddh takneek koo aage badhaane kii koshish curr rahey hain, vaastav mein aapako achche paksh/burey paksh kaa ehsas karaata haye	haan, aisa lagata hai ki unhonne vaastavik duniya kee sthitiyon se jude kathaanak binduon ko jodane ka ek bahut achchha kaam kiya hai, is dveep par phir se jangalon dvaara aakraman kiya ja raha hai taaki unakee yuddh takaneek ko aage badhaaya ja sake aur aapako vaastav mein achchhe paksh / bure paksh ka ehasaas ho.
Especially with the Germans trying to engineer an even deadlier version of the chemical weapons they had, I think that ties very well into everyone's ingrained mortality.	vishesh roop seey jaba german apane paas maujood rasayanik hathiyaron kaa aur bhee adhik ghaatak sanskaran banaane kii koshish curr rahey hain, tou mujhe lagata haye kii yeh harr kissy kii mrityu darr mein bahut achchi tarah seey shamil haye.	vishesh roop se germans ke paas raasaayanik hathiyaaron ke ek bhee ghaatak sanskaran ko injeeniyar karane kee koshish kar raha tha, mujhe lagata hai ki har kisee kee nirbaadh mrtyu dar mein bahut achchha sambandh ha
I also like that Hippolyta allowed her sister to train Diana, giving her the extra she needed to really stand out from the amazonian warriors	mujhe yeh bhee pasand haye kii hippolita ney apani bahan koo dyna koo prashikshit karane kii anumati dee, jisase usey amazonian yoddhaon seey vaastav mein alag dikhane key liye aavashyak atirikt suvidhaaen mileen.	mujhe yah bhee pasand hai ki hippolyta ne apanee bahan ko daayana ko prashikshit karane kee anumati dee thee, jisase use vah atirikt dene kee jaroorat thee jo vaastav mein amaajoniyan yoddhaon se baahar khade hone kee jaroorat thee
I felt that was a very feminist-inspired scene, which I really enjoyed seeing in the film. That was a big dynamic in how the World War was almost exclusively fought by men, with the sole woman wanting to end it.	mujhe lagaa kii vaha bahut hii nariwadi-prerit drishya thaa, jise film mein dekhkar mujhe bahut majaa aayaa. yeh ack badee gatishilata thee kii kaise vishva yuddh lagbhag vishesh roop seey purushon dwara ladaa gayaa thaa, aur ekmatra mahila ise samaapt karna chaahati thee.	mujhe laga ki yah ek bahut hee naareevaadee-prerit drshy tha, jise philm mein dekhakar mujhe bahut maja aaya. yah ek bada gatisheel tha ki kaise vishv yuddh lagabhag vishesh roop se purushon dvaara lada gaya tha, ekamaatr mahila jo ise samaapt karana chaahatee thee
that is a really interesting point that I haven't considered, I know that the film was widely proclaimed to give a voice to feminism but that point really solidifys that	yeh vaastav mein ack dilchasp bindu haye jiss parr maine vichaar naheen kiya haye, mujhe pataa haye kii film koo narivad koo aavaaj dene key liye vyaapak roop seey prachaarit kiya gayaa thaa lekin yeh bindu vaastav mein ise majboot kartaa haye	yah vaastav mein ek dilachasp bindu hai jis par mainne vichaar nahin kiya hai, mujhe pata hai ki philm ko vyaapak roop se naareevaad ko ek aavaaj dene ke lie ghoshit kiya gaya tha lekin yah bindu vaastav mein thos hai
I really didnt except Sir Patrick to Ares, its an interesting dynamic that really came out.	maine vaastav mein surr patrick seey eres kii ummeed naheen kii thee, yeh ack dilchasp gatishilata haye joe vaastav mein saamane aaee haye.	mujhe vaastav mein sar patrick se ares kee ummeed nahin thee, yah ek dilachasp gatisheel hai jo vaastav mein saamane aaya hai.
I thought the scene when Sir Patrick revealed himself as Ares also influenced that, where he wanted to use the Godkiller sword to destroy humanity, but Wonder Woman said no.	maine socha kii vaha drishya jaba surr patrick ney khud koo eres key roop mein prakat kiya thaa, usane bhee usa parr prabhaav daala thaa, jahaan vaha manavata koo nasht karane key liye godkiller talwar kaa upayog karna chaahata thaa, lekin wonder women ney naheen kahaa.	maine socha jis scene main Sir Patrick reveal kiya kyonki Ares ne bi influence kiya tha, jahan woh Godkiller sword ko use karke humanity ko destroy karna chatha tha, lekin Wonder woman ne no kah diya.
yeah I really didn't except wonder women to be the godkiller although it does make sense	haan, maine vaastav mein mahilaaon koo ishwar-hatyari honey parr ashcharya naheen kiya, haalaanki iska koee matlab naheen haye	yeah main really expect nahin kiya wonder woman hi godkiller thi although isme koi sense nahin hai
I think that was another big feminist point in the movie, in my opinion. The ending of the movie was very heartfelt and connected how wars of the past influence our present when Princess Diana emailed Bruce Wayne	merrie raay mein, yeh film mein ack aur badaa nariwadi bindu thaa. film kaa anta bahut hii marmic thaa aur isase judaa thaa kii kaise ateet key yuddh hamaare vartamaan koo prabhaavit karate hain jaba rajkumari dyna ney broose wein koo email kiya thaa	i think woh ek bada feminist point hai movie hai, mere opinion hai.movie ka ending bahut heartfelt tha aur connect kiya ki kaise past wars hamare present ko influence karte hain princess diana ne email kiya bruce wayne ko
yeah, I think the dynamic between the all the characters fits really well, linking it all togheter, from diana and bruce, to diana and ares, and ares and zues	haan, mujhe lagata haye kii sabhi paatron key beach kii gatishilata vaastav mein achchi tarah seey fitt baithati haye, dyna aur broose seey laker dyna aur eres, aur eres aur zius taka sabhi koo ack saath jodate hue.	haan, mujhe lagta hai characters ki dynamics acchi fit karti hai, sabhi ko link karte hue, diana aur bruce se lekar, diana aur ares thak aur ares aur zues
The casting helped make the movie incredible, the charisma and chemistry between every character showed. The scene where Steve hijacked the bomber showed that very well I think.	casting ney film koo avishvasaniya banaane mein madad kii, harr kirdar key beach karishma aur chemistry dikhi. mujhe lagata haye kii vaha drishya jahaan steve ney bamvarshak kaa apaharan kiya thaa, yeh bahut achchi tarah seey dikhaaya gayaa haye.	casting ne help kia movie ko incredible banane ke liye, charisma aur chemistry ke andar character dikhta hai.jo scene jahan steve ne bomber ko hijack kiya acchi tarah dikhta hai.
Steve has a really inteseting role in the movie too, providing a lot of support but still not taking over the main role	film mein steve kii bhoomika bhee kaafee dilchasp haye, vaha kaafee sahyog dey rahey hain lekin phir bhee mukhya bhoomika naheen nibha rahey hain	steve ka bhi accha interesting role hai movie mein, bahut support deta hai lekin phir bhi main role nahi leta
His character was an excellent supporting character in my opinion.	merrie raay mein unaka kirdar ack behtareen sahaayak kirdar thaa.'	uska charcter excellent supporting charcter hai mere khayal se.
Hello, I'd love to know the name of the movie	namaste, mujhe film kaa naam jaanana achchha lagega	hello, mujhe film ka naam jaanna atcha lagega.

Of course, who wouldn't want Chris Pine as a love interest!	nihsandeh, criss pine koo premi key roop mein kaun naheen chaahega!	Of course,  kaun nahin chayega Chris Pine as a love interest!
The Greek mythology was a nice touch to the standard superhero formula	greek pauraanik kathaaen maanak superheiro formule kaa ack achchha sparsh theen	Greek mythology ka bahut accha use kiya standard superhero formula ke saath.
The Greek mythology was great, but I thought it was a bit confusing.	yunani pauraanik kathaaen mahaan theen, lekin mujhe lagaa kii yeh thodi bhramit karane vaali theen.	The Greek mythology was great, but mujhe lagta hai it was a bit confusing.
Yeah I'm sure that wasn't explained as well as it should have, but they probably needed to get to the bang bang scenes faster	haan, mujhe yakeen haye kii ise utani achchi tarah seey naheen samajhaaya gayaa jitna ise samajhaaya jaanaa chaahiye thaa, lekin shayed unhein baing-baing drishyon koo tezi seey dekhane kii zaroorat thee	Yeah, I am sure that wasn't explained jaisse hona chaiiya tha, par ho sakta hai they needed to get to the bang bang scenes faster
True, people went for the action for sure. I personally like movies with a bit more of a back story.	sach haye, loga kaarravaai key liye zaroor gaye they. mujhe vyaktigat roop seey thodi adhik pichhali kahani vaali filmein pasand hain.	True, log surely action k liye gaye hai. Personally mujhe thoda bahut back story wali movies acchi lagti hai
Right, I wouldn't mind an extra 5-10 minutes with more detailed story about Ares and Zeus	thheek haye, mujhe eres aur zius key baare mein adhik vistrit kahani key saath 5-10 minut kaa atirikt samay dene mein koee aapatti naheen hogi	Bilkul, main Ares aur Zeus k baare me 5-10 minute ki detailed story mind nahi karta hai.
Yes, t hat and also about how Zeus met an Amazonian.	haan, yeh haye aur yeh bhee kii zius ack amazonian seey kaise milaa.	Haan wo aur Zeus kaise ek Amazonian ko mila wo bhi
The training scenes were great with her mom the Queen though	haalaanki usaki maan raani key saath prashikshan key drishya bahut achche they	Wo training scene uski mom the Queen k saath kaafi acche the
I mean her mom's sister, her auntie	meraa matlab haye usaki maan kii bahan, usaki chaachi	I mean uski mom ki behen, uski auntie.
Oh for sure! I loved seeing the evolution of how she trained and how strong she got.	oh nishchit roop seey! mujhe yeh dekhkar achchha lagaa kii usane kaise prashikshan liya aur vaha kitni majboot hui.	Oh bilkul sure! Mujhe uske training aur kitni strong hogayi ka evolution bahut pasand aaya.
I'm glad they made the lasso a strong weapon.	mujhe khushi haye kii unhone lasso koo ack majboot hathiyar banaaya.	Main glad hu k unhone lasso ko ek strong weapon banaya hai
Yes. I also liked the scene when Diana saves Steve when he crashes into the ocean. A woman saving a man in a movie for once.	haan. mujhe vaha drishya bhee pasand aayaa jaba steve key samudra mein girane parr dyna usey bachaati haye. ack mahila ack film mein ack baar ack aadami koo bachaa rahee haye.	Haan. Mujhe Diana ka Steve ko uske ocean me  crash k baad bachane wala scene bhi kafi accha laga.Ek aurat aadmi ko bachate hue pahli baar
Yeah there was alot of feminine cheering  in the theater for that scene	haan, usa drishya key liye theatre mein mahilaaon kaa khoob utsaah thaa	Haan us scene me theatre me kaafi feminine cheering thi
I hated that her aunt died when the Germans invaded though.	haalaanki, mujhe iss baat seey nafrat thee kii jaba germans ney aakraman kiya tou usaki chaachi kii mrityu hoe gaee.	Mujhe German invasion me uski aunt ka marna pasand nahi aaya.
yeah that was sad, pretty unavoidable though to advance the story and give gravitas to WW's journey	haan, yeh dukhad thaa, haalaanki kahani koo aage badhaane aur ww kii yatra koo gambhirta dene key liye yeh bahut apariharya thaa	han ye sad tha, kafi unavoidable tha magar story ko advance karne ke liye aur WW ki journey ko gravitas dene ke liye
How did you like Sir Patrick?	aapako surr patrick kaisa lagaa?	Tumhe Sir Patrick kaisa laga?
I was a little surprised by his reveal, but I wasn't paying much attention to everyone else outside of WW, CP and the scenery tbh	main usake khulaase seey thodaa aashcharyachakit thaa, lekin main doubluedblue, cp aur drishyon key alawa baaki sabhi parr jyada dhyaan naheen dey rhaa thaa.	main uske reveal se surprised tha, lekin main zyada attention pay nahi kar raha tha WW, CP aur scenere ke outside kisiko bhi
I saw that coming. Too predictable that he was Ares I thought.	maine usey aatey dekhaa. maine socha kii vaha eres thaa, yeh bahut purvaanumaanit haye.	Mujhe pata chal gaya tha. Ye bohat predicatable tha ki wo Ares tha I thought
right, but there's only so much they can do it's a huge movie designed for the masses, not for those with discriminating tastes ;)	thheek haye, lekin way kewal itna hii curr sakate hain kii yeh ack badee film haye joe janata key liye banaai gaee haye, naa kii bhedbhavpurna swaad vaale logon key liye;)	right, lekin wo bhi kitna karein ye ek huge movie thi masses ke liye, discriminating tastes walo ke liye nahi
Haha, very true! I thought it was neat that they started the story by Diana reminiscing while looking at an old picture though!	haaha, bilkul sach! maine socha kii yeh achchi baat haye kii unhone kahani kii shuruat dyna dwara ack purani tasveer koo dekhate hue yaad dilaate hue kii!	haha, bohat sahi! mujhe laga ye kafi neat tha ki unhone movie ko start kia Diana ke ek old picture ko dekhkar huye reminisce karte huye
yeah the ending reminded me of Captn America with his story in the past and waking up to the modern day world	haan, anta ney mujhe capton america kii ateet kii kahani aur aadhunik duniya key prati sachet karane kii yaad dilaa dee	han movie ki ending se mujhe Captain America ki ending yaad agyi sath mein uski past ki story aur modern world mein jaagne ki
Yes, but from different universes ;)	haan, lekin vibhinn brahmaandon seey ;)	han par alag universes se
Heh at this point it doesn't really matter unless you're really invested in either universe	haye iss bindu parr yeh vaastav mein koee fark naheen padata jaba taka kii aap vaastav mein kissy bhee brahmand mein niveshit naa houn	Heh leki ye matter nahi karte is point par unless tum inme se kisi universe mein invested ho
True. Can't wait till the next installment!	satya. agali kist taka intazaar naheen curr sakate!	True. Main next istallment tak wait nahi kar sakta.
But with CP taking the bomber away to detonate is just like Captn America going to the Arctic to destroy HIS bom b	lekin cp dwara bamvarshak koo visfot karane key liye leey jaanaa bilkul vaisa hii haye jaise capton america apane bumm koo nasht karane key liye archtic jaa rhaa haye.	Lekin cp bambaare karane kelie visphot karane kelie door le ja raha hai jaise captain america apane bomb ko nasht karane kelie arctic ja raha hai
yeah, im sure it'll be a great one	haan, mujhe yakeen haye kii yeh bahut achchha hoga	Haan mujhe yakeen hai ki yah bahut achchaa hoga.
For sure, many similarities. I have to say I liked Wonder Woman more so than Batman VS Superman.	nishchit roop seey, kaee samaantaaen. mujhe kahana hoga kii mujhe batman banaam superman kii tulana mein wonder women adhik pasand aaee.	Mujhe yakeen hai ki kae samanataon kelie mujhe wonder woman ko batman vs superman se adhik pasand karana hoga

Sure, it stars Steve Carrell as a supervillan, with Russell Brand as his scientist/partner in crime. It was directed by Pierre Coffin..	nishchit roop seey, isamen steve carrell koo ack paryavekshak key roop mein aur russel brand koo unake vaigyaanik/aparaadh mein bhagidar key roop mein dikhaaya gayaa haye. iska nirdeshan piyare coffin ney kiya thaa.	sure, isme Steve Carrell supervillan ,  Russell Brand jese star he , Russell Brand uski crime me scientist/partner he.

Mujhe steve carrell pasand hai, Maine uski jo bhi movie dekhi usme vo funny the. mujhe lagata hai ki use ek animated avaj par kam karte dekhana funny hoga.

yes i mean lol	haan meraa matlab haye hahaha	Haa, Mera matlab hai lol
it really is! It is designed very well, and his personality comes through in the animation. Steve Carrell is trying to steal the moon after another villan steals the Pyramid at Giza	vaha vakai mein! ise bahut achche seey design kiya gayaa haye, aur animation mein unaka vyaktitva jhalakata haye. geeza mein ack anya khalnayak dwara pyramid churaane key baad steve carrell chandrama koo churaane kii koshish curr rahey hain	ye vahi he! ye bahut hi achcha design huva hai, aur uska vyaktitva animation me aata hai. Jab Giza me dusre villan Pyramid churate hai tab Steve Carrell chand churane ki koshish karte hai
oh wow that sound interesting. what age group  would you see this movie is made for?	arey vaah, yeh dilchasp lugg rhaa haye. aap yeh film kiss ayu varg key liye bunny dekhenge?	are wow, vo interesting sunai padta hai. Ye movie apko kis age group ke liye banai lagti hai?
I would say it's for young kids all the way up to adults. It is a good blend of silly and intelligent humor	main kahoonga kii yeh chhote bachchon seey laker vayaskon taka key liye haye. yeh murkhtapurna aur buddhiman haasy kaa achchha mishran haye	Mujhe lagta hai, yah bachho aur sathme bado ke liye bhi hai. yah mukhatapurn aur buddhiman hasya ka ek achchha mishran hai
is there alot of singing in the movie? i dont particular like musical type movies but my kids do?	kyaa film mein bahut saaraa gaanaa haye? mujhe vishesh roop seey sangeetmay prakaar kii filmein pasand naheen hain lekin merey bachchon koo pasand hain?	Kya movie me bahut sare gane hai? main vishesh rup se musical type movies pasand nahin karata, lekin mere bachche karate hain
there's a song written just for this movie by Pharell. It's not too much music, and it's probably too hard for kids to memorize & sing constantly, but there are characters called Minions that dance and act very silly	farrell dwara iss film key liye ack geet likhaa gayaa haye. yeh bahut adhik sangeet naheen haye, aur bachchon key liye ise yaad rakhna aur lagaatar gaanaa shayed bahut kathin haye, lekin minion naamak paatr hain joe nritya karate hain aur bahut murkhtapurna vyavhaar karate hain	is movie ke lie Pharell ne sirf ek geet likha hai. Isme bahut jyada music nahin hai, aur shayad bachchon ko yaad rakhana aur lagatar gaana ga pana bahut mushkil hai, lekin isame Minions ka kirdar hain jo dance aur bahut murkhatapurn abhinay karata hai
oh ok. lol sounds like my kind of movie. I'm a big kid at heart	oh thheek. haaha, yeh merrie tarah kii film lagati haye. main dill seey badaa bachcha huun	oh ok. Meri tarike ki movie lagati hai. main dil se bada bachcha hu
is the movie pretty long or standard?	kyaa film kaafee lambi yaa maanak haye?	kya movie kafi long hai ya standard?
me too, I really enjoyed it. It's a good mix of funny and feel-good, Gru eventually adopts three little girls who help him steal the moon. It is not too long, maybe 1.5 hours	mujhe bhee, maine vaastav mein iska anand liya. yeh mazakia aur achchha mahsoos karaane kaa ack achchha mishran haye, gru antatah teen chhoti ladkiyon koo god letaa haye joe usey chaand churaane mein madad karati hain. yeh bahut lamba naheen haye, shayed 1.5 ghante	mujhe bhi, maine isey bohat enjoy kiya. Ye funny aur feel-good ka accha mix hai, Gru eventually teen ladkion ko adopt kar leta hai jo usey moon chori karne mein help karti hai. ye zyada long nahi hai, shayad 1.5 hours
oh that is not bad at all. i think i will look forward to seeing this movie with my kids. should keep their attention for awhile. lol	oh, yeh bilkul bhee buraa naheen haye. mujhe lagata haye kii main apane bachchon key saath yeh film dekhane kaa intazaar karunga. thodi dair key liye apana dhyaan rakhna chaahiye. zor-zor seey hansana	oh ye buri nahi hai. mujhe lagta hai main apne kids ke saath ye movie dekhna chahunga. unka attention thode while ke liye bana rahega. lol
lol it definitely will! although they might just want to watch it over and over again	haaha yeh nishchit roop seey hoga! haalaanki hoe sakata haye kii way ise baar-baar dekhana chaahen	lol ye definitely karegi! although wo shayad isey bar bar dekhna chahenge
cool, this definitely helped me out . oh hey is this a disney movie or who is it made by?	badhiya, isase nishchit roop seey mujhe madad millie. arey, kyaa yeh disney film haye yaa ise kisane banaaya haye?	cool, ye definitely mujhe help karta hai. oh kya ye disney movie hai ya ye kisne banayi hai?
It's made by a French studio Mac Guff, but Illumination Entertainment bought the studio and released this movie with Universal Pictures.	ise francisi studio mack guff ney banaaya haye, lekin illumination entertainment ney studio khareed liya aur universal pictures key saath iss film koo release kiya.	Ye ek French studio Mac Guff ne banayi hai, lekin Illumination Entertainment ne us studio ko kharid liya aur Universal Pictures ke saath us movie ko release kia.
oh wow i didn't know universal had their hands in animation.	arey vaah, mujhe naheen pataa thaa kii universal kaa animation mein haath haye.	oh wow mujhe nahi pata tha universal had their hands in animation
i didn't either, I think maybe they're involved because it was a Computer Animated film	maine bhee naheen kiya, mujhe lagata haye kii shayed way isamen shamil hain kyonki yeh ack computer animated film thee	main bhi nahi. Mujhe lagta hain wo involved they kyunki ye Computer Animated film hai.
oh. makes sense	oh. samajh mein aataa haye	oh. makes sense
will you watch it with your children or let them watch it while you do other things?	kyaa aap ise apane bachchon key saath dekhenge yaa anya kaam karate samay unhein ise dekhane denge?	kya tum isey apne bacchon ke saath dekhoge ya unhe dekhne doge jab tum kuch aur kar rahe hoge?
i thiink i would like to watch it with them. Sounds like it may be fun for the whole family.	mujhe lagata haye kii main ise unake saath dekhana chahunga. aisaa lagata haye kii yeh poore parivaar key liye mazedaar hoe sakata haye.	I think unke saath ise dekhne me mujhe accha lagega. Aisa lagta hai ye puri family ke fun hoga.

it was a difficult decision to make	yeh ack kathin nirnay thaa	ye karne ke liye mushkil decision tha
The guy that leaked the story, was that played by Tom Hanks?	jiss aadami ney kahani leak kii, kyaa uska kirdar tomm hanks ney nibhaaya thaa?	jis bande ne story leak ki, kya wo Tom Hanks ne play kia?
Nope, Tom Hanks is an assistant editor a the post, he tracks down Ellsberg as the source of the leak	naheen, tomm hanks post key sahaayak sampaadak hain, vaha leak key srot key roop mein ellsberg kaa pataa lagaate hain	Nahi, Tom Hanks post ka assistant editor hai, wo Ellsberg ko as leak of source track down kar leta hai

Han, editor Katharine Graham ko pata tha ki usey decide karna padega ki isey publish karein ya nahi, agar wo karegi, wo contempt of the court ke liye charge ho sakti hai aur agar wo publish karegi, to wo washington post ko importan joturnalistic institution ki tarah establish karta hai.
she was the heir of the newspaper so she considered it a family legacy	vaha akhbar kii uttaradhikari theen isaliye vaha ise parivarik viraasat maanati theen	Wo newspaper ki heir thi to wo usko apni family legacy samajhti thi

Supreme court ne newspapers ke favor mein 6-3 se decision diya,  which vindicated Graham's decision.

the next to last bullet point is funny, "Though the premise of fighting robots does seem a plausible and intriguing extension of the contemporary WWE world. reminds of Robots VS wrestlers in How I Met Your Mother  episdoes	antim bullet point key aage majakia haye, "halanki robot seey ladane kaa aadhar samkaaleen wwe duniya kaa ack prashansaniya aur dilchasp vistaar prateet hotaa haye. haau aaee mett yore madar episode mein robot banaam pahalvaanon kii yaad dilaata haye	last bullet se agla bahut funny hai, "maana ki fighting robots ki premise plausible lagti hai aur intriguing extension ek contemporary WWE world ki. yaad dila ta hai How I Met Your Mother waali Robots VS wrestlers ki

I can't honestly say, however, as a critic noted "it's better than Man of Steel but not as good as The Dark Knight".	haalaanki, main imandari seey naheen kaha sakata, jaisa kii ack aalochak ney kahaa, "yeh maine off steel seey behtar haye lekin dha dark night jitna achchha naheen haye".	mai sach nhi keh skta halaki ye man of steel se better hai lekin dark knight jitni achi nhi hai
Who are the lead actors?	mukhya abhineta kaun hain?	lead actors kon hai>
It follows 2013's Man of Steel so you would probably need to see it just to be safe...	yeh 2013 key maine off steel kaa anusaran kartaa haye, isaliye aapako surakshit rahane key liye sambhavatah ise dekhane kii aavashyakta hogi...	ye 2013 ki man of steel ko follow krti hai so safely dekhna

Haha kya aap jante ho ki is film mai konse actor Batman, Superman, aur Wonder Womanrole ker rhe hai?
Ben Affleck plays Batman/Bruce Wayne, Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent/Superman. Gal Gadot stars in the film as well as Diane Lane as Martha Kent and Amy Adams as Louis Lane. Are you a fan of any of those actors?	bayne affleck ney batman/broose wein kii bhoomika nibhai haye, heinry caville ney clark kent/superman kii bhoomika nibhai haye. film mein galle gadot key saath-saath dyne laine ney martha kent aur ammy addams ney luis laine kii bhoomika nibhai haye. kyaa aap inmein seey kissy abhineta key prashansak hain?	Ben Affleck Batmanka Bruce Wayne, Henry Cavill Clark Kent Superman ka role paly ker rhe hai. Gal Gadot film mai Diane Lane Martha Kent ka aur Amy Adams Louis Lane ka role play ker rhe hai. kya tum in actors ke fan ho
All but Ben Affleck. Lest super hero movie I saw him in was Daredevil and that was rough. Let's hope he's better in this.	bayne affleck koo chhodkar sabhi. navintam superheiro film joe maine usey dekhi thee vaha daredeville thee aur vaha kathin thee. aasha karate hain kii vaha isamen behtar hoga.	sabhi lekin Ben Affleck ki last super hero movie main usse Daredevils mai dekh tha wo mote tha hoskta hai isme kuch acha kam hoga
Though, I am a Michael Keaton fan when it comes to Batman. I suspect anyone playing Batman who is not Keaton will be weird to me.	haalaanki, jaba batman kii baat aatee haye tou main michael keaton kaa prashansak huun. mujhe sandeh haye kii batman kaa kirdar nibhaane vaalaa koee bhee vyakti, joe keaton naheen haye, merey liye ajib hoga.	halaki me batman mai Michael Keaton ka fan hu muje lgta hai ki koi or batman ka paly nhi ker payge jo michel keaton ne kiya
Most of the critics wasn't too fond of it, but CinemaScore have it a rating of B, which I feel is about right for this film!	adhikansh sameekshakon koo yeh pasand naheen aayaa, lekin cinemascore ney ise bee rating dee haye, joe mujhe lagata haye kii iss film key liye bilkul sahee haye!	bhote se critics ko ye pasand nhi tha par cinemascore mai rating B thi muje lgta hai ye sahi thi
Have you seen it?	kyaa aapane ise dekhaa haye?	kya tumne dekhi hai
I have and would grade it a solid B, just as CinemaScore did. Are you a fan of director Zack Snyder?	merey paas ise ack thhos bee grade haye aur main ise cinemascore kii tarah hii grade doonga. kyaa aap nirdeshak zack snider key prashansak hain?	Maine is solid B grade karta, jaise k CinemaScore ne kiya. Kya tum director Zack Snyder k fan ho?
I'm not sure. What other movies has he directed?	mujhe yakeen naheen haye. unhone aur kaun see filmein nirdeshit kii hain?	Main sure nahi hu, usne aur kaunsi movies direct ki hai?
He directed Batman vs Superman. The film takes place 18 months after the battle between General Zod and Superman. Superman becomes a controversial figure while Clark Kent learns of Batman's form of justice and seeks to expose him via Daily Planet articles.	unhone batman versays superman kaa nirdeshan kiya. yeh film general zode aur superman key beach ladaai key 18 maheene baad kii haye. superman ack vivadaspad vyakti bunn jaataa haye jabaki clark kent koo batman key nyaay key tareeke key baare mein pataa chalata haye aur vaha delly planet lekhon key madhyam seey usey benkab karna chaahata haye.	Usne Batman V Superman direct ki hai. Wo movie General Zod aur Superman k battle k 18 month baad hoti hai. Superman ek controversial figure ban jata hai aur Clark Kent ko Batman k Justice k tareeke k baare me pata chalta hai aur wo use Daily Planet k articles me expose karna chahta hai
Has he directed anything else besides the Batman or Superman movies?	kyaa unhone batman yaa superman filmon key alawa kuchh aur nirdeshit kiya haye?	Kya usne Batman aur Superman movie k alawa kuch direct kiya hai?
I can't honestly say. I know he directed this film while David S. Goyer and Chris Terrio cowrote it.	main imandari seey naheen kaha sakata. main jaanata huun kii unhone iss film kaa nirdeshan kiya thaa jabaki david aiss. goyer aur criss terrio ney iska sahalekhan kiya thaa.	Honestly, main bol nahi sakta hai. Mujhe pata hai k usne ye film direct ki hai aur David S. Goyer aur Chris Terrio ne write ki hai
Batman and Superman are enemies in this film?	iss film mein batman aur superman dushman hain?	Kya Batman aur Superman is film me enemies hai?
They are - Lex Luthor, who is obsessed with defeating Superman, basically manipulates them into fighting each other.	way hain - lakes luther, joe superman koo haraane key liye jununi haye, mool roop seey unhein ack-dusare seey ladane key liye prerit kartaa haye.	Wo hai. Lex Luthor jo Superman ko harane ko lekar obsessed hai , basically dono ko ek dusre ko fight karne me manipulate kar deta hai.
Whose side is Wonder Woman on?	wonder women kisaki taraf haye?	Wonder Woman kis side pe rahti hai.
Well to be honest, Batman has Superman beat and just before he can kill Superman, Superman utters "save martha" to which Lane enterenters and explains Martha is his mother. Batman rescues Martha while Superman confronts Luther on the scout ship. At this point, Wonder Woman hasn't debuted yet	sach kahuun tou, batman ney superman koo haraa diyaa haye aur isase pahale kii vaha superman koo maar paataa, superman kahata haye "sev martha" jiss parr laine pravesh karati haye aur bataati haye kii martha usaki maan haye. batman ney martha koo bachaaya jabaki superman ney scout jahaaj parr luther kaa saamana kiya. iss bindu parr, wonder women ney abhee taka shuruat naheen kii haye	Well to be honest, Batman Superman ko hara deta hai aur jaise hi wo Superman ko maarne wala rahta hai, Superman bolta hai "save martha" to Lane andar aati hai aur explain karti hai k Martha uski maa hai. Batman Martha ko rescue karta hai aur Superman scout ship pe Luthor ko confront karta hai. Is point pe Wonder Woman ab tak debut nahi ki hai
Dang! Crazy that Batman has Superman beat! Isn't Batman just a millionaire with a lot of fancy gadgets? Superman at least has real super powers. You would think that would give him a one-up. Did Batman have kryptonite  or something?	daang! yeh pagalpan haye kii batman ney superman koo haraa diyaa! kyaa batman dher saare fancy gazets vaalaa karodpati naheen haye? superman key paas cumm seey cumm vaastavik mahashaktiyan hoti hain. aap sochenge kii isase usey badhat mill jaayegi. kyaa batman key paas cryptonite yaa kuchh aur thaa?	Dang! Crazy Batman superman ko hara deta hai. Kya wo bas ek millionaire nahi juske pas bhut fancy gadget hai. Superman k paas at least real super powers hai. Koi bhi sochega k wo superman jeetega. Kya Batman k paas kryptonite ya kuch tha?
I do very much agree with you! It is puzzling but Batman has a spear he plans to kill superman with just before he utters the "Save Martha" line, halting Batman from killing him.	main aapse bilkul sahmat huun! yeh hairan karane vaalaa haye lekin batman key paas ack bhaala haye jisase vaha "sev martha" line bolane seey thheek pahale superman koo maarne kii yojana banaa rhaa haye, jisase batman usey maarne seey rook jaayega.	main aapase bahut sahamat hoon! yah hairaan karane vaala hai, lekin baitamain ke paas ek bhaala hai, jisase vah suparamain ko maarane kee yojana banaata hai, isase pahale ki vah "sev maartha" lain ka upayog karata hai, baitamain ko maarane se rok deta hai.
Do the join forces after that?	kyaa usake baad senaa mein shamil honge?	kya usake baad sena mein shaamil hote hain?
they*	way*	वे*
They do thankfully - Batman actually saves Martha while Superman travels to the scout ship to Confront Luther.	way shukragujar hain - batman vaastav mein martha koo bachaata haye jabaki superman luther kaa saamana karane key liye scout jahaaj kii yatra kartaa haye.	ve shukr manaate hain - baitamain vaastav mein maartha ko bachaata hai, jabaki suparamain ka saamana loothar ke saath skaut jahaaj tak jaata hai.
Does he kill Luther?	kyaa vaha luther koo maartaa haye?	kya vah ko Luther maarata hai?
Luther was also the one who kidnapped Martha. He doesn't kill Luther but Luther is arrested to which Batman confronts him while he's in prison, warning that he'll always be watching.	luther hii vaha vyakti thaa jisane martha kaa apaharan kiya thaa. vaha luther koo naheen maartaa haye, lekin luther koo giraftar curr liya jaataa haye, jiss parr batman jail mein rahate hue uska saamana kartaa haye aur chetavani detaa haye kii vaha hamesha dekhta rahega.	Luther bhee vahee tha jisane maartha ka apaharan kiya tha. vah loothar ko nahin maarata hai, lekin loothar ko giraphtaar kar liya jaata hai, jisamen baitamain ne jel mein rahane ke dauraan usaka saamana kiya, chetaavanee dee ki vah hamesha dekhata rahega
So basically leaving an opening for another movie in the franchise?	tou mool roop seey franchisee mein ack aur film key liye opening chhod rahey hain?	to mool roop se phrainchaizee mein ek aur philm ke lie ek opaning chhod raha hoon?
I've heard debates on Superman's and Batman's outfits in this movie. Some say that they are awesome and some say that they are ridiculous and too different form their b eloved originals. What are your thoughts on this?	maine iss film mein superman aur batman key pahanaave parr bahas sunee haye. kuchh loga kahate hain kii way adbhut hain aur kuchh kahate hain kii way hasyaspad hain aur apane priya mool seey bahut bhinn hain. iss parr aapke vichaar kyaa hain?	mainne is philm mein suparamain aur baitamain ke aautaphit par bahas sunee hai. kuchh ka kahana hai ki ve kamaal ke hain aur kuchh kahate hain ki ve haasyaaspad hain aur bahut alag roop mein unake b ailovaid mool hain. is par aapake vichaar kya hain?
They do...

that is intresting	yeh dilchasp haye	yah dilachasp hai
were they able to stop the shark	kyaa way shark koo rokane mein saksham they	kya ve shaark ko rokane mein saksham the
I think one of the best scenes is when the police chief, the shark expert, and the shark hunter all get together to on the shark hunter's boat, the Orca.	mujhe lagata haye kii sabse achche drishyon mein seey ack vaha haye jaba pulis pramukh, shark visheshagya aur shark shikari sabhi shark shikari kii naav, orka parr ack saath milate hain.	mujhe lagata hai ki jab pulis pramukh, shaark visheshagy, aur shaark shikaaree sabhee ek saath shaark shikaaree naav, orka par pahunchate hain to sabase achchha drshy hota hai.

It attacks the boat and eats the shark hunter.	yeh naav parr hamla kartaa haye aur shark shikari koo khaa jaataa haye.	yah naav par hamala karata hai aur shaark shikaaree ko kha jaata hai.
wow that must be scary	vaah, yeh tou daravana hoga	vaah jo daraavana hona chaahie
Then the police chief stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into it's mouth and shoots the tank.	phir pulis pramukh ack dabaavyukt scuba tank koo usake munh mein bhar detaa haye aur tank koo goli maar detaa haye.	phir pulis pramukh ek dabaavayukt skooba taink ko munh mein bharate hain aur taink ko golee maarate hain.

I agree. I'm slightly disappointed by the Rotten Tomatoes score. Then again, it is the first time that Pixar has made a prequel film.	main sahmat huun. main rotten tomatose score seey thodaa nirash huun. phir, yeh pahali baar haye kii pixer ney prekwal film banaai haye.	Main sehmat huin. Main zara Rotten Tomatoes ke score se disappointed huin. Phir se, yeh pehli baar hai ki Pixar ne ek prequel film bnayi hai.
Do you typically watch movies like Monster's University?	kyaa aap aamtaur parr monsters university jaisi filmein dekhate hain?	Kya aamtaur par Monster's University jaisi movies dekhte ho?
Typically no since i generally like to watch anime. But if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid. Then I usually will make a effort to see it.	aamtaur parr naheen, kyonki main aamtaur parr anime dekhana pasand kartaa huun. lekin aggar franchisee vaha haye joe maine taba dekhi thee jaba main bachcha thaa. phir main aamtaur parr ise dekhane kaa prayas karunga.	Zyadatar nhi main aamtaur par anime movies dekhta huin. Lekin jab main bacha tha to ek hi franchise dwara banayi gayi movies dekhta tha. To main aamtaur par aisi movies dekhne ki koshish krta huin.
And i agree those scores kinda seem rather low.	aur main sahmat huun kii yeye ank thode cumm prateet hotey hain.	Aur main maanata hoon ki voh score thode kam lag rahe hain.
I understand. Just by glancing at the ratings, do you think you'd make an effort to go see the prequel? Or would the score discourage you from seeing the film?	main samajhata huun. kewal ratings parr nazar daalane seey, kyaa aapako lagata haye kii aap prekwal dekhane kaa prayas karenge? yaa phir score aapako film dekhane seey hatotsaahit karega?	Main samjhta huin. Sirf ratings to dekh kar, tumhe lagta hai ki iss prequel ko dekhne ki koshish krte? Ya score tumhe movie dekhne ke liye discourage krte hai?
Id still see it despite bad reviews. I generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not. Like if 99% of people say its bad or good. I usually won't follow what i hear. I just go and experience it for myself. And then from there I usually say its cool or  say its bad.	kharab sameekshaon key bavjood bhee main ise dekhunga. main aam taur parr cheezon kaa nirnay swayam karna pasand kartaa huun, yeh dekhane key liye kii mujhe yeh pasand haye yaa naheen. jaise kii 99% loga ise buraa yaa achchha kahate hain. main aamtaur parr joe sunata huun uska paalan naheen kartaa. main buss jaataa huun aur ise apane liye anubhav kartaa huun. aur phir vahaan seey main aamtaur parr kahata huun kii yeh achchha haye yaa kahata haye kii yeh buraa haye.	Main isse bure reviews milne ke baad bhi dekhunga. Main zayadtar cheezein khud dekh kar decide krna pasand krta huin ki mujhe pasand hai ya nhi. Jaise agar 99% log kehte hai ki ye buri hai ya achhi. Main aamtaur par baatein sunn kar unke peeche nhi jata. Main bas chala jata huin or khud se experience krta huin. Aur phir main aamtaur par batata huin ke ye badiya hai ya buri.
Makes sense. I typically only pay attention to the ratings when it's a director who I am familiar with. If I know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings, I usually will wait to hear from friends/family before paying to see it.	samajh mein aataa haye. main aam taur parr rating parr tabhi dhyaan detaa huun jaba vaha koee aisaa nirdeshak hoe jisase main parichit huun. aggar mujhe pataa haye kii unaka kaam aamtaur parr abhootpoorv haye aur kissy vishesh film kii rating bahut kharab haye, tou main aamtaur parr ise dekhane key liye bhugtan karane seey pahale doston/parivaar seey sunane kaa intezar karunga.	Samajh mein aata hai. Main jayadatar tab ratings pe dhayan deta huin jab main director ko janta huin. Agar mujhe pata hai ki aamtaur par unka kam bahut shaandaar hai or uss ek movie ke bahut buri ratings, main aamtaur par uspe paise lagane se pehle friends/ family se sunn leta huin.
Also im a fan of comedy movies. So I'll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes.	main comedy filmon kaa bhee prashansak huun. tou main shayed meams aur chutkulon kaa anand loonga.	Saath hi mein mujhe comedy movies bhi pasand hai. To main shayad memes or jokes enjoy karunga.
Ya same.	haan vahee.	Main bhi.
Comedy movies are always a must see in my book.	merrie kitab mein comedy filmein hamesha jaroor dekhi jaani chaahiye.	Comedy movies meri book me must see hain
And if im being honest, pixar usually makes good movies so I have good expectations. Illumination movies is what im " iffy" about.	aur aggar main imandar rahuun tou pixer aamtaur parr achchi filmein banaata haye isaliye mujhe achchi ummeeden hain. illumination filmon key baare mein main "iffi" huun.	Aur sach bolun to, pixar hamesha achi movies banati hai to mujhe achi expectations hain. Illumination movies keliye main thoda "iffy" hun.
I love that Monster's University has a fraternity involved. Even more so love it because they call it Roar Omega Roar.	mujhe achchha lagaa kii monster university mein ack biradari shamil haye. yeh aur bhee adhik pasand haye kyonki way ise roar omega roar kahate hain.	mujhe acha laga ki Monster's University me fraternity involved thi. Aur bhi zyada kyunki wo isey Roar Omega Roar bulaate hain.
Mike is 7???? What in the...I never knew that.	mike 7 varsh kaa haye???? isamen kyaa...mujhe yeh kabhi naheen pataa thaa.	Mike 7 hai???? Kya..mujhe ye bilkul nahi pata tha

He's only seven when he goes on the field trip. He goes to college eleven years later.

Wo sirf seven tha jab wo field trip pe jata hai. Wo gyarah saal bad college ko jata ha. To wo ab attharah ka hoga.
I misread that at first too.	maine bhee pahale usey galat padhaa.	maine bhi ye pehle misread kiya
ahhh I see well that clears that up.	aaha, main achchi tarah dekh rhaa huun, isase yeh saaf hoe gayaa haye.	ahhh mujhe lagta hai ye sab clear kar deta hai
Looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities.	aisaa lagata haye kii yeh film kaafee hudd taka cartoon biradari parr adharit haye.	lagta hai ye movie kafi heavily cartoon fraternities par based hai.
yep	haan	yep
I find it odd that Pixar has a scene in this movie where Sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores. Doesn't really promote the whole 'fair play' imagine to their age demographic.	mujhe yeh ajib lagata haye kii iss film mein pixer kaa ack drishya haye jahaan sule behtar ank paane key liye machine seey chhedchhaad kartaa haye. vaastav mein unaki umr key jansankhyikiya key liye sampoorn 'nishpaksh khel' kii kalpana koo badhaava naheen detaa haye.	muje thoda odd laga, is movie mein pixar ke liye yek scene hein, jaha sulley tampers with the machine ne better score kiya... aajkal ka demographic mein fairplay ne promote nahi kiya
Oozma Kappa. I can't believe they threw a kappa meme in there.	oozama kappa. main vishvaas naheen curr sakata kii unhone vahaan ack kappa mem fenka haye.	oozma kappa. muje nahi lagtha koi kappa ka meme banega
Every movie with a fraternity/sorority always contains 'Kappa.' Ever notice that?	biradari/sorority vaali pratyek film mein hamesha 'kappa' hotaa haye. kyaa aapane kabhi iss parr dhyaan diyaa haye?	har movie mein kappa ka fraternity/ sorority banaya. kya aap notice nahi kiya
ya. Its pretty much a dead meme.	haan. yeh kaafee hudd taka ack mrit mem haye.	haan.. pretty dead meme tha

Wonder what CDA stands for in this movie. Clearly, it's some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have?	ashcharya haye kii iss film mein cda kaa kyaa arth haye. spasht roop seey, yeh kissy prakaar kaa pravartak haye, lekin ack rakshas key paas kiss prakaar kaa pravartak hotaa haye?	cda tho is movie ke liye stands kiye... clearly, kuch enforcer form kare aur monster ke paas kis taray ka enforcer hein
idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough.	shayed yeh sunishchit karane key liye kii way kaafee daraavane hain.	yeh kuch scary ke tarh bhi ho sakthe
Nope! I thought the same. I think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph.	naheen! merrie ack jaisi hii soch haye. mujhe lagata haye kii aisaa isaliye thaa kyonki antim paragraph mein koee ling sandarbh naheen thaa.	nahi, muje bhi aise hi kuch lagtha,.. kyon ki is mein kuch gender context nahi hein
yeah probably.	haan shayed.	haan
Well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids.	vaise yeh bachchon key liye ack surakshit film lagati haye.	tho yeh kids ke liye tho safe movie hein
No, I don't think it's to make sure they're scary enough... the CDA has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university.	naheen, mujhe naheen lagata kii yeh sunishchit karane key liye haye kii way kaafee daraavane hain... cda koo kissy prakaar kaa puliskarmi banana hoga kyonki way vishvavidyalaya seey unake nishkasana key kaaran unhein parisar seey baahar nikaal rahey hain.	nahi, muje nahi lagtha yeh itna bhi scary hoga... CDA ne cop ko form kiya aur usse campus se expulsion karne ke liye university aathe
Although i  expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there.	haalaanki mujhe ummeed haye kii kuchh chhipe hue vayask chutkule college aur biradari kaa kaaran banate hain aur mujhe lagata haye kii way vahaan ack yaa dou koo khiska dete hain.	thoda hidden adult jokes hein us college aur fraternity ne tho yek ya do slip jarur liya hoga
Ah i see that would make sense.	aaha, main dekh rhaa huun kii iska koee matlab hoga.	ah, ab hui na baath
I agree. I was skeptical about the cheating portion of the movie as that doesn't coincide  with a kids film and what you'd want to teach the kids at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monster's actions,.	main sahmat huun. mujhe film key dhokhadhadi vaale hisse parr sandeh thaa kyonki yeh bachchon kii film seey mell naheen khaata haye aur aap iss umr key star parr bachchon koo kyaa sikhana chaahte hain, lekin way rakshas key kaaryon key liye nakaratmak pushtakaarak laate hain.	mein maantha hoon.. us cheating portion is movie mein jo skeptical hein, lekin kids film ke liye tho bilkul coincide nahi huva... is saal ke bachon ko kya sikhane chathe yeh tho pura negative reinforces hein us monsters ka action ka
True. Movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them.	satya. aajkal filmein farmulabaddh pachadon mein iss kadar funce gaee hain kii bachche unhein pasand karane lagate hain.	sach.. in dinno mein movies tho itna formulaic tropes hein, jo kids ko nahi dekha sakthe
I hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable.	mujhe ummeed haye kii film taazaa aur thodi apratyaashit rahegi.	movies tho fresh aur unpredictable honna mera hope hein

So Carreys character, Bruce Nolan, is a reporter. Hardworking, but not very successful. He has a lot of bad luck and reaches his limit when his co worker receives a promotion over him	tou carrie kaa charitra, broose nolan, ack patrakar haye. mehnati, lekin bahut safal naheen. uska bhagya bahut kharaab haye aur hudd tou taba hoe jaati haye jaba usake sahakarmi koo usase oopar padonnati milati haye	tho carreys ka character, bruce nolan hein jo reporter hein. hardworking lekin successful nahi hein. uska bad luck bahut hein tho voh limit mein nahi reach hota jab us coworker neih promotion ke liye gaya tho

More as in "why God leaves some prayers unanswered"	jaise kii "ishwar kuchh prarthanaon koo anuttarit kyon chhod detaa haye"	jyada hone se pata nai kyun bhagwan ne kuch prathnaon ko unsunna kar diya

This movie is about how Facebook got started by Mark Zuckerberg, it's called "The Social Network". Interesting to watch because it's based on real events.	yeh film iss baare mein haye kii facebook kii shuruat maark jukerberg ney kaise kii, ise "dha soshal network" kahaa jaataa haye. dekhana dilchasp haye kyonki yeh vaastavik ghatnaaon parr adharit haye.	Mark Zuckerburg ne Facebook kaise start kiya movie is baare me hai, iska naam hai "The Social Network". Dekhne me bahut interesting hai kyonki ye real events pe based hai.
I have heard of that movie before	maine usa film key baare mein pahale bhee sunaa haye	maine is movie ke baare me pahle bhi suna hai
Although I haven't watched it before	haalaanki maine ise pahale naheen dekhaa haye	Although maine pahle dekhi nahi hai
It was more popular than the book it was based on, The Accidental Billionaires, probably because it's a tale of Sex, Money, and Betrayal. Stuff we can all identify with	yeh jiss kitab parr adharit thee, dha accidental billionaires seey adhik lokpriya thee, shayed isaliye kii yeh sex, paisa aur vishvaasghaat kii kahani haye. vaha cheez jisase humm sub pehchaan sakate hain	Yah jis kitab par yah aadharit hai usse bhi jyada popular hai, The Accidental Billionaires, probably because ye kahani hai Sex, Money aur dhokhe ki, wo stuff jiske sath ham sab identify karte hai.
Oh that is really interesting	oh, yeh vakai dilchasp haye	oh yah to really interesting hai
It makes it sound more intriguing than before	yeh ise pahale seey adhik dilchasp banaata haye	yah to pahle se jyada intriguing sound kar raha hai
Have you seen it	kyaa aapane ise dekhaa haye	kya aapne dekhi hai
Yes, we've all heard of Facebook, but the story of how it got started is pretty surprising. I didn't believe everything I saw in the movie, but it held my interest	haan, humm sabhi ney facebook key baare mein sunaa haye, lekin isaki shuruat kaise hui isaki kahani kaafee aashcharyajanak haye. maine film mein joe kuchh bhee dekhaa, usa parr mujhe vishvaas naheen huaa, lekin isamen merrie ruchi bunny rahee	yes, ham sabne Facebook ke bare me suna hai, but ye shuru kaise hua uski story kafi surprising hai. movie me jo dekha us sab par believe to nahi hua, par mera interest isme bana raha
I think sometimes they add information to movies just to keep the audience entertained	mujhe lagata haye kii kabhi-kabhi way darshakon kaa manoranjan karane key liye filmon mein jaankaari jodate hain	I think sometime ye movie me kuch information sirf ise interesting aur audience ko entertained rakhne ke liye karte hai.
Which is understandable because you don't want a boring movie	joe samajh mein aataa haye kyonki aap ack ubaau film naheen chaahte hain	Ye understandable hai because koi bhi boring movie nahi chahta.
I had no idea it was a book thogh	mujhe naheen pataa thaa kii yeh ack kitab haye	mujhe bilkul idea nahi tha ke wo book hai
No doubt, It is a drama. Zuckerberg and the current staff weren't involved in making the movie, it has a kind of dark irony, but one of the founders, Eduardo Saverin, was consulted by the book's author.	nihsandeh, yeh ack naatak haye. jukerberg aur vartamaan karmchari film banaane mein shamil naheen they, isamen ack prakaar kii gahari vidambana haye, lekin sansthapakon mein seey ack, eduardo severine seey pustak key lekhak ney paramarsh kiya thaa.	beshak ye drama hai. Zuckerberg  aur current staff ka koi involvement nahi tha movie banane ,isme kuch dark irony hai lekin ek founder,Eduardo Saverin ne book ke author se mulaqat ki
I am sure there is information that they didn't want to leak in the movie and even the book	mujhe yakeen haye kii aisee jaankaari haye kii way film aur yahaan taka ​​kii kitab mein bhee leak naheen honah chaahte they	mujhe yaqeen hai kuch information  hai jo wo log movie ya book mein leak nahi karna chahte
So would you recommend seeing this movie? It a couple of years old if not older.	tou kyaa aap yeh film dekhane kii salah denge? yeh adhik naheen tou kuchh varsh purana haye.	toh kya aap ye movie dekhna recommend karte hai? ye kuch saal puraani hai agar aur zyada puranni nahi hai toh
Yes, it's an engaging look at that time period when websites were just getting started. Some of the lawsuits that came out of those beginnings might still be on going.	haan, yeh usa samayaavadhi parr ack aakarshak nazar haye jaba websiten abhee shuru hii hui theen. una shuruaaton mein seey kuchh mukadame abhee bhee chala rahey honge.	haan, ye engaging look hai us waqt mein jub websites bus shuru ho rahe thay. kuch lawsuits  jo jub shuruat mein nikle thay shayad bhi bhi chal rahe hai
I believe it. I remember reading about the lawsuits when they were filed. I think they have great lawyers to protect themselves though...	meraa vishvaas haye. mujhe una mukadamon key baare mein padhana yaad haye jaba way daayar kiye gaye they. mujhe lagata haye kii unake paas khud koo bachaane key liye mahaan vakeel hain...	mujhe yaqeen hai. mujhe yaad hai  maine padha tha jub lawsuits file hue thay. mere khayal se unke pass khud ko bachanay ache lawyers hai
The film starts in 2003 when Zuckerberg was a 19 year old student at Harvard. He actually created a campus website called Facemash that allowed users to rate the attractiveness of photos of female students.	film kii shuruat 2003 seey hoti haye jaba jukerberg harvard mein 19 saal key chhaatr they. unhone vaastav mein facemash naamak ack campus website banaai, joe upayogkartaon koo mahila chhaatron kii tasveeron key aakarshan kaa mulyankan karane kii anumati detee thee.	film shuru hoti hai 2003 mein jub Zuckerberg  19 saal ka student  tha Harvard mein. usne asal Facemash naam ki campus website banayi jisme users female students ke photos ke attractiveness  ko rate kar sakte thay
That is a really good overall description for someone who wants a synapse  of the movie.	yeh kissy aise vyakti key liye vaastav mein achchha samagr vivaran haye joe film kaa saransh chaahata haye.	ye puray taur par bahut acha description  hai unlog ke liye jinko movie ka synapse  chahiye
Oh, that's just the beginning. That website was so popular it got the attention of the Winklevoss twins, who were upper class men who made a dating website exclusive to Harvard.  So the origins of the idea for the site are kind of vague	oh, yeh tou buss shuruat haye. vaha website itani lokpriya thee kii usa parr winklevos judvaan kaa dhyaan gayaa, joe uchch varg key purush they jinhone harvard key liye vishesh roop seey ack detting website banaai thee.  isaliye site key vichaar kii utpatti kuchh aspasht haye	Oh,wo toh bus shuruat hai. wo website itni popular hai ke isko Winklevoss twins ka attention mila,jo  upper class men thay jinho ne Harvard ke liye exclusive  dating website banayi
Is the company protected by a patent or some kind of legal documents?	kyaa company patent yaa kissy prakaar key kanuni dastaavez dwara sanrakshit haye?	kya company kuch patent ya legal documents ki hifazat me hai
I don't know, but Zuckerberg was given 6 months academic probation for hacking into college databases and crashing the Harvard computer network. So he's aware of what kind of damage a rogue programmer can do.	mujhe naheen pataa, lekin zuckerberg koo college databases koo hack karane aur harvard computer network koo crashes karane key liye 6 maheene kii shaikshanik pariveeksha dee gaee thee. isaliye vaha jaanata haye kii ack dusht programmer kiss prakaar kaa nuksan curr sakata haye.	Main nahi jaanta, par Zukerbreg ko college database ko hack karne aur harward computer network ko crash karne ke liye 6 months ka academic probation mila tha. So wo is baat se aware hoge ki rogue programmer kis prakar ka damage kar sakte hai.
As a programmer I could see the damage that can be done by hacking into databases and networks.	ack programmer key roop mein main databases aur network koo hack karke honey vaale nuksan koo dekh sakata thaa.	As a programmer me ye dekh sakta hun ki databases aur networks me hacking se jo nuksaan ho sakta hai.
damage was bound to happen in this situation	aise mein nuksan tou honah hii thaa	damage is situation me hone ke liye bounded tha.
So you also know that programming knowledge doesn't necessarily translate to business smarts. It's when Zuckerberg gets hooked up with Napster co-founder Sean Parker that the business really starts to take off	tou aap yeh bhee jaanate hain kii prograaming gyaan aavashyak roop seey bijnes smart mein tabdil naheen hotaa haye. jaba jukerberg napster key saha-sansthaapak shaun parker key saath juda jaate hain tou vyavasaay vaastav mein aage badhana shuru hoe jaataa haye	So tum bhi ye jaante ho ki business ko smart translate karne ke liye programming ka knowledge necessary nahi hai. Ye jab zukerberg ne Napster ke co-founder sean parker se hooked up kiya, is se business really me take off karna start karta hai.
I had totally forgotten about using Napster. I use to always use it. Had no idea he co-f ounded it.	main napster kaa upayog karna poori tarah seey bhool gayaa thaa. main ise hamesha istemal kartaa thaa. mujhe naheen pataa thaa kii unhone isaki saha-sthaapana kii haye.	Me Npaster ko use karne ke baare me totally bhool gaya tha. Me use hamesa use karne ka aadi hun. Mujhe koi idea nahi ki wo iska co-founder hai
There were other social networks before The Facebook, too, which is what Zuckerberg called it while expanding the site to Yale, Columbia, and Stanford. I liked Napster, too, and had a MySpace account.  But that all changed after Parker suggested they drop 'The' and move Facebook to Palo Alto.	facebook seey pahale anya soshal network bhee they, jise jukerberg ney yell, kolambiya aur stanford mein site kaa vistaar karate samay kahaa thaa. mujhe napster bhee pasand aayaa aur meraa ack myspace khaata bhee thaa.  lekin yeh sub taba badal gayaa jaba parker ney sujhaav diyaa kii way 'dha' koo chhod dein aur facebook koo paalo aulto mein sthanantarit curr dein.	Facebook ke pehle bhi other social networks the, jo ki zuckerberg ne kaha tha jab wo site ko yale, columbia aur stanford me expand kar rahe the. Mujhe Nepster bhi pasand hai, aur mera Myspace ka account bhi hai. But ye sab badal gaya jab parker ne suggest kiya facebook to palo alto.
I I also had a MySpace account but haven't logged in roughly  2 years.	merey paas bhee ack myspace khaata thaa lekin maine lagbhag 2 varshon seey logg inn naheen kiya haye.	Mere pass bhi Myspace account hai par maine kabhi hi 2 years me logged in kiya.
Been a while for me, too.  Parker ended up sharing a house in Palo Alto with Zuckerberg, leaving his partner Saverin in New York to work on "Business Development". Meanwhile they were developing plans for the business in California to make a billion dollar company.	mujhe bhee kuchh samay hoe gayaa.  parker ney zuckerberg key saath paalo aulto mein ack ghar saajha karna shuru curr diyaa, aur apane saathi severine koo "bijnes development" parr kaam karane key liye newyork mein chhod diyaa. iss beach way california mein ack arab dollar kii company banaane key liye vyavasaay kii yojanaaen vikasit curr rahey they.	Mere liye thodi der ho gayi. Paker ne zuckerberg ke saath house sharing khatm kar di Palo alto me, apne partner saverin ko new york me hi business development ka kaam karne ke liye chhod diya. Meanwhile wo california me billion dollar ki company  ke business plan ko develop karne lage.
That is crazy. To have potentially in a company to make a billion dollar company is mind blowing	vaha pagalpan haye. kissy company mein ack arab dollar kii company banaane kii kshamata honah aashcharyajanak haye	Ye crazy tha. Unke pass company ko million dollar ki company banane ka potential hai jo ki mind blowing hai.
Well, Saverin and the Winklevoss twins tried to keep their interests in the company. The film is intercut with scenes from their depositions in the cases against Zuckerberg. They eventually settled out of court because Zuckerberg's defense thinks he will appear unsympathetic to a jury.	khair, severine aur winklevos judvaan ney company mein apani ruchi banaae rakhane kii koshish kii. film mein jukerberg key khilaf mamalon mein unaki gawahi key drishyon koo shamil kiya gayaa haye. way antatah adalat seey baahar chaley gaye kyonki jukerberg key bachaav paksh koo lagata haye kii vaha juurii key prati sahanubhutihin dikhaai denge.	Well, Saverin aur Winklevoss judwa ne apan interests company me rakhne ka try kiya. Film me un scenes ko intercut kar diya jisme Zuckerberg ke against deposition case the. Unhone eventually court ke bahar hi settle kar liya, zukerberg ke defense sochte hai ki wo jury ko unsympathetic appear hoge.
Well if he wasn't going to seem unsympathetic  than maybe it was the best choice for the defense	khair, aggar vaha sahanubhutihin naheen lugg rhaa thaa tou shayed yeh bachaav key liye sabse achchha vikalp thaa	tho, agar voh unsympathetic ke liye nahi jaayega tho defense he uska best choice rehega
No doubt, the film has lots of sordid details about the founding and the callous attitude Zuckerberg had towards his collaborators. But the end, when he's sending a friend request, is when it get's really weird.	isamen koee sandeh naheen haye, film mein sansthaapak aur jukerberg key apane sahyogiyon key prati udaseen ravaiye key baare mein bahut saare ghinaune vivaran hain. lekin anta mein, jaba vaha friend request bhej rhaa hotaa haye, taba yeh vaastav mein ajib hotaa haye.	no doubt, film mein tho kahi sordid details hein us founding aur callous ka attitude ke baare mein, zuckerberg tho us collaborators ke sa saath hein.. lekin end mein, jab usne usko friend ko request diya tho thoda weird feel huva
Ugh I hate endings that either leave cliff hangers or just ends with no explanation of the future events	uha, mujhe aise anta seey nafrat haye joe yaa tou cliff hanger chhod dete hain yaa bhavishya kii ghatnaaon key baare mein koee spashteekaran naheen dete hue samaapt hoe jaate hain	ugh, mein end hate kartha kyon ki voh cliff hangers ko nahi choda aur end mein kuch explanation bhi nahi diya us future events ko
I hear you. This ending has to deal with a world where Superman is absent, and after every one leaves, the dirt on top of Clark's coffin starts rising into the air. How about that!	main tumhen sunata huun. yeh anta ack aisee duniya seey sambandhit haye jahaan superman anupasthit haye, aur harr kissy key jaane key baad, clark key taaboot key oopar kii gandagi havaa mein uthane lagati haye. usa key baare mein kaisa haye!	mein sun liya.. ending tho world he deal karna chahiye, lekin superman absent they aur sabhi yek ke piche chod rahe the, clarks ka coffins upper se dirt ud raha tha hava mein. kaise huva yeh sab
Thanks!	dhanyavaad!	thanks
Hello!	namaste!	Hello?
Hello so the movie we will be talking about is Batman V. Superman	namaskar, tou humm jiss film key baare mein baat curr rahey hain vaha haye batman vee. superman	Hello to hum aaj jis movie k baare me baat karege wo hai Batman V Superman
Great! I haven't actually seen that yet, but have been really wanting to. Which actors play Batman and Superman?	mahaan! maine vaastav mein ise abhee taka naheen dekhaa haye, lekin vaastav mein dekhana chaahata huun. kaun seey abhineta batman aur superman kii bhoomika nibhaate hain?	Great, maine abhi tak wo dekhi nahi hai, but sahi me dekhna chahta hu. Batman aur Superman kaun actors bane hai?
The actors are really great and you probably know all of them. Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, and Jesse Eisenberg to name a few.	abhineta vaastav mein mahaan hain aur aap shayed una sabhi koo jaanate hain. bayne affleck, heinry caville, ammy addams aur jessy easenberg unamen seey kuchh key naam hain.	Actors sahi me acche hai aur tum probably sabhi ko jaante ho. Unme se kuch Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, and Jesse Eisenberg hai
Oh, that is a great cast? Henry Cavill played Superman in the latest Superman film right?	oh, yeh ack mahaan kalakar haye? heinry caville ney navintam superman film mein superman kii bhoomika nibhai haye naa?	Oh, ye to badhiya cast hai? Henry Cavill ne latest Superman film me Superman play kiya tha na?
Sorry, a great cast!	kshama karein, bahut badhiya kalakar!	Sorry badhiya cast hai!
I am not sure but the film is still a part of the DC extended universe. Also it will be featuring wonder woman.	mujhe yakeen naheen haye lekin film abhee bhee dc vistaarit brahmand kaa ack hissa haye. saath hii isamen wonder women bhee hogi.	Main sure to nahi but ye movie DC extended universe ka part hai. Also isme wonder woman bhi ayegi
Ooh, that is excellent. I am looking forward to seeing Wonder Woman! Are Batman and Superman enemies at the start of the film?	oh, yeh tou bahut badhiya haye. main wonder women koo dekhane key liye utsuk huun! kyaa film kii shuruat mein batman aur superman dushman hain?	Oooh ye to excellent hai. Mujhe Wonder Woman dekhni hai. Kya film k start me Batman aur Superman dushman hai?
Well lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with Superman because he is obssessed with cloning superman.	khair, lakes luther ney batman koo superman key saath ladaai mein herfer kiya kyonki vaha superman kii cloning karane kaa jununi haye.	Well Lex Batman ko Superman se ladne me manipulate kar deta hai because wo superman ko clone kar ke liye obssessed hai.
Oh! So Batman is supposed to bring Superman to Lex Luthor?	oh! tou kyaa batman koo superman koo lakes luther key paas laanaa chaahiye?	Oh! To Batman Superman ko Lex Luthor k paas leke jata hai
No that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping. By the way did I mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman are in a movie together?	naheen, aisaa naheen haye phir bhee usey madad karane key liye uksaayaa jaataa haye. vaise, kyaa maine bataaya kii yeh pahali baar hoga jaba batman aur superman ack saath kissy film mein honge?	Nahi, waise nahi hota hai but wo use help karne me manipulate ho jata hai. By the way kya maine mention kiya ye pahli movie hai jisme batman aur superman saath me hai?
Really? The first time? That seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long! Very cool. Is the story set in Metropolis or Gotham?	vaastav mein? pahali baar? yeh jaankar bahut aashcharyajanak lagata haye kii paatr itane lambe samay seey maujood hain! bahut hii shaant. kyaa kahani metropolis yaa gotham parr adharit haye?	Really? pahli baar? Ye jaante huye ke dono character itne time se hai ye cheez to bahut amazing hai. Bahut cool. Story Metropolis me set hai k gotham me?
The film appears to take place in both cities, and Batman comes to view Superman as a threat to humanity.	aisaa prateet hotaa haye kii film donon shaharon mein ghatit hoti haye, aur batman superman koo manavata key liye khatare key roop mein dekhane lagata haye.	Aisa lagta hai k film dono cities me hoti hai, aur Batman ko lagta hai k Superman humanity k liye ek threat hai.
That is interesting, to have the film set in both cities. So Batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take Superman down?	donon shaharon mein film kaa sett honah dilchasp haye. tou batman superman koo neeche girana kuchh hudd taka apana kartavya maanata haye?	yeh tho interesting hei yar, is film tho dono cities ke hein. tho batman ko aasan padega us superman ka duty karne mein?
Well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because Clark Kent A.K.A. Superman learns of Batman's justice methods and tries to expose him. All this happening while Lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator.	vaise paatron key rishte kaafee jatil hain kyonki clark kent aii.key.aii. superman batman key nyaay key tarikon koo seekhata haye aur usey benkab karane kii koshish kartaa haye. yeh sub taba hoe rhaa haye jaba lakes luther ack senator seey cryptonite praapt karane key liye anumodan praapt karane key liye kadam uthaa rhaa haye.	tho is characters ka relationships tho bada complex hein yar kyon ki clark kent ke vaje. superman tho batmans ka justice method learn kiya aur usse expose bhi kiya. tho lex luthor ne kryptonite ko approval kiya us senator se
Interesting. And so, I imagine Lois Lane is in this story? If so, does she serve a greater purpose? Does she know both superheroes?	dilchasp. aur isaliye, mujhe lagata haye kii lois laine iss kahani mein haye? yadi haan, tou kyaa vaha kissy badey uddeshya kii poorti karati haye? kyaa vaha donon superheiro koo jaanati haye?	interesting yar, mein ab is story ko imagine ki.. tho uska greater purpose kya hein? kya voh dono superheroes ko jaanthi hein?
Maybe but I am not sure. By the way do you usually care about reviews?	hoe sakata haye lekin mujhe yakeen naheen haye. vaise kyaa aap aamtaur parr sameekshaon kii parwah karate hain?	mein kuch sure nahi hoon. kya aap reviews ke anusar movie dekhne chalte?
I will often read reviews to see what people have to say, but I don't change my mind about wanting to see a movie based on reviews. I think that I can't really know unless I see for myself. Do you care about reviews?	main aksar yeh dekhane key liye sameekshaaen padhata huun kii logon koo kyaa kahana haye, lekin main sameekshaon key aadhar parr film dekhane key baare mein apana vichaar naheen badalata. mujhe lagata haye kii main vaastav mein taba taka naheen zaan sakata jaba taka main khud naheen dekh letaa. kyaa aapako sameekshaon kii parwah haye?	mein tho reviews ke anusar hi jaatha ki kaise logo is movie ko dekhthe lekin mein reviews se apna mind change nahi kartha. muje lagtha hein ki yeh sab bakvas hein. kya aap review ko care karte?
Not usually I like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not I watch in theatres. I have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed.	aamtaur parr main apana khud kaa jaj banana pasand naheen kartaa, halanki aggar sameekshaaen bahut buri yaa achchi hain tou yeh prabhaavit curr sakata haye kii main cinemagharon mein dekhunga yaa naheen. mujhe inn filmon key baare mein kahana hoga halanki sameekshaaen kaafee mishrit hain.	nahi yar mein apne aap judge kartha.. lekin kuch reviews tho overwhelmingly acha ya bura hota jo muje theathres mein movie dekhte samai relate kartha hoon. muje lagtha hein ki is movies ka reviews thoda mixed hein
Did you enjoy this film?	kyaa aapane iss film kaa anand liya?	kya aap is film ko enjoy kiya?
I did. I really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman.	maine kiya. mujhe way drishya dekhana bahut pasand aayaa jahaan batman superman koo apane vash mein karane mein kamyab hotaa haye.	haan yar.. muje vakahi mein is scene pasand hein .. batman tho superman ko kisi tarah manage kar raha tha
Cool. I guess that's one of the ultimate questions, which one could beat out the other. Do they team up at all in the film ?	thandaa. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh antim prashnon mein seey ack haye, joe ack dusare koo maat dey sakata haye. kyaa way film mein bilkul bhee team banaate hain?	cool.. tho konsa yeh beat karega? kya yeh film teamup hoga?
Yes in Batman chooses to save Supermans mother while Superman confonts Lex.	haan, batman superman kii maan koo bachaane kaa vikalp chunata haye jabaki superman lakes kaa saamana kartaa haye.	haan... isme tho batman ne superman ka mom ko bachana ke liye choose kiya lekin superman tho lex ko confonts
Oh wow! The pairing of Batman and Superman's mom is a really cool part of the story, heartwarming.	arey vaah! batman aur superman kii maan kii jodee vaastav mein kahani kaa ack achchha hissa haye, dill chhoo lene vaali haye.	oh wow! Batman aur Superman ke mom ki pairing really sabse cool part tha story ka, heartwarming.
I know but the film ends with sadly the death of Superman.	main jaanata huun lekin film dukhad roop seey superman kii mrityu key saath samaapt hoti haye.	I know but sadly fim ka end Superman ki death ke sath hota hai.
Oh wow! I am surprised by that, I thought they would keep their story line going for another movie or two.	arey vaah! main isase aashcharyachakit huun, maine socha thaa kii way apani kahani koo ack yaa dou filmon key liye jaari rakhenge.	oh wow! mujhe surprise hua isse, I thought wo log apni story line ko aage badhne denge aage ki ek do aur movie ke liye.
Dont worry the dirt on top of the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the Director.	chinta naa karein, taaboot key oopar kii gandagi seey nirdeshak ney ack achchi palak jhapkaai.	Don't worry coffin ke upar ki dhool ko hilte hue dikhaya director ne kisi badhiya wink ki tarah.
Haha! That's the closing shot?!	haaha! vaha samaapan shott haye?!	haha! wo to closing shot tha?!
I believe so it is in the last scene.	meraa maanana ​​haye kii yeh antim drishya mein haye.	I believe so ye last scene me ha na
Awesome! Take care.	bahut badhiya! apana dhyaan rakhna.	awesome! take care
Hello! Do you like superhero movies?	namaste! kyaa aapako superheiro filmein pasand hain?	Hello! kya tumhe superhero movies pasand hai?
yes. batman begins! I think this a great batman film. have you seen it?	haan. batman shuru hotaa haye! mujhe lagata haye kii yeh ack behtareen batman film haye. kyaa aapane ise dekhaa haye?	haan. Batman begins! Mujhe lagta hai wo ek badhiya batman film hai, kya tumne dekhi hai?
Yes, I have. Christian Bale is my favorite Batman so far.	haan merey paas haye. christian bell meraa abb taka kaa pasandida batman haye.	Haan maine dekhi hai. Christian Bale mera ab tak ka favorite Batman hai
Do you usually check the ratings of movies before you see them?	kyaa aap aamtaur parr filmein dekhane seey pahale unaki rating dekhate hain?	Kya tum usually movie dekhne se pahle uski ratings dekhte ho?
I usually do. but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not	main aamtaur parr kartaa huun. lekin rating kii khuraak yeh taya naheen karati kii main film dekhunga yaa naheen	Usually haan, but rating se ye determine nahi hota k main movie dekhunga ya nahi
The film has several great big name actors, which is another reason I like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone	film mein kaee badey naami kalakar hain, yahee ack aur kaaran haye kii mujhe yeh pasand haye aur main ise kewal abhinetaon key aadhar parr hii dekhunga	Is film me bahut bade bade actors bhi hai, jo ki ek aur reason hai aur actors dekh ke hi movie dekh lege
I agree, there are quite a few great actors in Batman Begins. I like Liam Neeson too, even though he is one of the villains.	main sahmat huun, batman begins mein kaee mahaan kalakar hain. mujhe liam neesan bhee pasand haye, bhale hii vaha khalnayakon mein seey ack haye.	Main agree karta hu,  kuch bahut badhiya actors hai Batman Begins me. Mujhe Liam Neeson bhi pasand hai, bhale hi wo ek villain hai
seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest. along with super heros and villans.  a good  rating does help me feel like I will not waste my time watching something awful	badey parde parr mahaan abhinetaon kii kshamata koo ack saath dekhane seey merrie ruchi nishchit roop seey badhati haye. super hiro aur khalnayak key saath.  ack achchi rating mujhe yeh mahsoos karane mein madad karati haye kii main kuchh bhayaanak dekhane mein apana samay barbad naheen karuungaa	Badhiya actors ka saath me badi screen me hone ka potential me definitely mera interest. Superheros aur villains k sath hi. Ek good rating se mujhe ye feel karne me asani hoti hai k kuch bekaar dekh k apna time waste nahi karra hai.
but the same time will not deter me from a film If i am just into the genre	lekin aggar main sirf isi shally mein huun tou samay mujhe film seey naheen rokega	But at the same time wo mujhe movie dekhne se rok nahi sakta jiske genre me main bahut interested hu.
I personally prefer good ratings. Even if a movie has many good actors, if it's rated poorly, I usually won't watch it in theaters.	main vyaktigat roop seey achchi rating pasand kartaa huun. bhale hii kissy film mein kaee achche kalakar houn, aggar usey kharab rating milati haye, tou main aamtaur parr usey cinemagharon mein naheen dekhunga.	mein good ratings ko prefer karthi.. agar movies mein kitne bhi ache actors hote tho bhi rated poorly hi dethe jo mein kabhi theaters mein nahi watch kartha
I'm not sure if I agree with the Metacritic Score of 70/100, though.	haalaanki, mujhe yakeen naheen haye kii main 70/100 key metacritic score seey sahmat huun.	mein itna sure nahi hein, metacritic score 70/100 diya
The 84% on Rotten Tomatoes seems more accurate.	rotten tomatose parr 84% adhik sateek lagata haye.	rotten tomatoes ne 84% ne diya jo accurate hein
I will generally have enough patience to wait for a film to be released on DVD/Video if the rating turn me off.	aggar rating mujhe nirash karati haye tou aam taur parr merey paas dvd/video parr film release honey kii prateeksha karane key liye paryaapt dhairya hoga.	mein tho patience se wait kartha aur DVD/ video me hi dekhta..
What did you think of the bat scene in the movie?	aapane film mein balle vaale drishya key baare mein kyaa socha?	tho aapko is movie mein bat scene ke baare mein kya sochthe?
I felt that scene shows the story of this film well, and is thought out.	mujhe lagaa kii vaha seane iss film kii kahani koo achche seey dikhaata haye aur socha-samajha haye.	muje laga, us scene is story ko showup kiya, jo thought out hein
I wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well, though.	haalaanki, mujhe ashcharya haye kii kyaa sookhe kuein key alawa chamgaadadon key liye koee behtar jagah thee.	muje lagtha hein ki bat keliya us dry well ke alava bhi aur kuch ache jhaga milega
batman as a child was good step by the filmm aker to show how his life started out	bachpan mein batman kaa kirdar nibhana film nirmaata dwara yeh dikhaane kaa achchha kadam thaa kii usake jeevan kii shuruat kaise hui	batman, bachon ko ache film hein. kyon ki unhe life ka startup milega
Because this movie is called Batman Begins, I agree that it was appropriate to show Bruce's beginnings.	kyonki iss film kaa naam batman begins haye, main sahmat huun kii broose kii shuruat koo dikhaana uchit thaa.	are is movie ko batman begins ka naam diya hein lekin muje lagtha isko bruce ka beginning dena chahiye
I think it's ironic that the mugger's name is Joe Chill, but he isn't  chill if he murders people.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh vidambana haye kii lutere kaa naam joe chill haye, lekin aggar vaha logon kii hatyaa kartaa haye tou vaha shaant naheen haye.	haan joe chill ke liye tho yeh ironic hein, kitna chill se voh people ko murder kartha
unlikely yes, I think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be.  but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to   the bats	asambhaavit haan, mujhe lagata haye kii way yeh dikhaane key liye ack rahasyamay shuruat karane jaa rahey they kii batman kaise banaa.  lekin phir bhee vaha kuchh rahasya chhodana chaahata haye kyonki usey abhee bhee chamgaadadon seey darr lagata haye	Shayad han, mujhe lagta hai ki wo log batman kaise bana uski mysterious shuruvat batane ja rahe the. par thodi mystery choodna chahta hu kyuki use abhi bhi bats se phobia ho jata hai
very ironic. mr chill is more of a bone  chilling murderer.	bahut vidambanapurna. mister chill ack haddiyan kampa dene vaalaa hatyara haye.	bahut ironic hai. mr chill bone chilling murderer hai.
He is also murdered too, so at least he gets what he deserves.	usaki bhee hatyaa curr dee jaati haye, isaliye cumm seey cumm usey vahee milata haye jiska vaha hakdar haye.	Isne bhi khun kiya hai, so jo woh deserve karta hai usko mil gaya.
he got whats coming to him. but  bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge	usey vaha mill gayaa joe usake paas aaa rhaa haye. lekin broose usaki hatyaa naheen curr paataa isaliye mujhe lagata haye kii vaha badala lena chaahata haye	usko pata chal gaya tha uske sath kya hone wala hai. par Bruce uska khun nahi karega isiliye muje lagta hai ki usme revenge ki bhavna rahegi
I think it helps to establish that Bruce will not directly murder anyone. Even when he burns down the League of Shadows, he doesn't directly kill Ra's al Ghul.	mujhe lagata haye kii isase yeh sthaapit karane mein madad milegi kii broose seedhe taur parr kissy kii hatyaa naheen karega. yahaan taka ​​kii jaba vaha leag off shados koo jalaa detaa haye, taba bhee vaha seedhe taur parr raa all ghul koo naheen maartaa haye.	Mujhe lagta hai ki Bruce kisika khun nahi karega aisa establish karna accha hoga. Woh jab League of Shadows ko jala deta hai tab bhi woh Ra's al Ghul ko directly nahi marega.
Injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder, in any case.	kissy bhee mamle mein anyaay koo hatyaa key kaaran key roop mein istemal naheen kiya jaanaa chaahiye.	Kisi bhi case me khun ka karan anyay nahi bataya ja sakta.
I feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows, and to purge his fear of bats. this key part I think is pretty lucky break for him. as he is doing jail time in a foreign country.	mujhe lagata haye kii vaha chhaaya leag kaa hissa banane aur chamgaadadon key prati apane darr koo door karane key liye bhagyashali haye. mujhe lagata haye kii yeh mahatvapurna hissa usake liye bahut bhagyashali break haye. kyonki vaha videsh mein jail kii sazaa kaat rhaa haye.	woh lucky hai ki woh League of Shadows ka part bana hai aur usne apne bats ke dar ko bhaga diya hai. mujhe lagta hai ki yah important part uske liye lucky break sabit hoga. kyuki woh foreign country ke jail me hai.
It is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing...	yeh ajib haye kii uska parivaar ack butler kaa kharch uthaa sakata thaa lekin vaha chori key aarop mein jail chalaa gayaa...	yah bilkul ajeeb baat hai ki iski family naukar afford kar shakti hai fir bhi wah jail me chori karne jata hai
I really like Gary Oldman as Gordon. He plays a good cop really well.	main vaastav mein gorden key roop mein gairi oldman koo pasand kartaa huun. vaha ack achche pulis vaale kii bhoomika bahut achche seey nibhaate hain.

Sometimes, Spielberg makes these movies that are not very adventure related... I love Spielbergs work if theyre going to be adventure movies.	kabhi-kabhi, spielberg aisee filmein banaate hain joe bahut adhik saahasik filmon seey sambandhit naheen hoti hain... aggar way saahasik filmein banane jaa rahee hain tou mujhe spielberg kaa kaam pasand haye.	kabhi kabhi, Spielberg ke movie utne adventure related nahin hote... mujhe Spielbergs ki work pasand hai agar woh adventure movies hon toh

HI	namaste	Hi
Zootopia have u see this movie	zootopia kyaa aapane yeh film dekhi haye?	Kya tumne zootopia movie dekha
hello	namaste	hello
Hi@	namaste@	namaste
Hi. Can you tell me the name of the movie?	namaste. kyaa aap mujhe film kaa naam bataa sakate hain?	namaste. kya aap  mujhe philam ka naam baata sakte hai
It's Mean Girls.	yeh matlabi ladakiyan hain.	eska matlab ladakiya hai.
Have you seen it?	kyaa aapane ise dekhaa haye?	kya tumne isko dekha hai?
No I have not. Is it about girls?	naheen, merey paas naheen haye. kyaa yeh ladkiyon key baare mein haye?	nahi mei nai. ye ladaki ke baare mei hai?
Yes. And those girls are mean	haan. aur voe ladakiyan matlabi hoti hain	haan aur wo girls kaafi mean hai
It's a 2004 film that is an American teen comedy film written by Tina Fey	yeh 2004 kii film haye joe teana phey dwara likhit ack americi kishore comedy film haye	Wo ek 2004 American teen comedy film hai jise Tina Fey ne write kiya hai
Do you know the rating of the movie?	kyaa aap film kii rating jaanate hain?	Tumhe us movie ki rating pata hai ?
What I know is that Rotten Tomatoes named it in its "Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies".	mujhe joe pataa haye vaha yeh haye kii rotten tomatose ney ise "sheersh 50 mahantam kishore comedies" mein naamit kiya haye.	Mujhe pata hai k Rotten Tomatoes ne use apni "Top 50 Greatest Teen Comedies" me dala hai
So it was received pretty well.	isaliye ise kaafee achchha response milaa.	To, kaafi well received movie hai
Is it something you could take a child to see?	kyaa yeh koee aisee cheez haye jise aap kissy bachche koo dikhaane leey jaa sakate hain?	Kya ye movie baccho ko dikha sakte hai?
I guess it depends on your style of parenting and how old they are. The movie does have sexual references and (I think) cursing.	mujhe lagata haye kii yeh aapke paalan-poshan kii shally aur unaki umr parr nirbhar kartaa haye. film mein yaun sandarbh aur (mujhe lagata haye) apshabd hain.	I guess wo tumhari parenting style pe depend karta hai aur ispe k wo kitne bade hai . Movie me sexual referencec aur mujhe lagta hai ki cursing bhi hai.
But that's to be expected in a teen comedy film.	lekin ack kishore comedy film mein isaki ummeed kii jaani chaahiye.	But teen comedy film me itna to expected hi hai.
Do you know if it won any major awards?	kyaa aap jaanate hain kii isane koee badaa puraskar jeetaa?	Kya tumhe pata hai agar usne koi major awards jeete?
It was praised as being "comic gold".	ise "comic gold" kahakar saraha gayaa.	Usko "comic gold" bolke praise kiya gaya tha.
That sounds pretty good. Do you know if Tina Fey has written any other movies?	yeh bahut achchha lagata haye. kyaa aap jaanate hain kii teana phey ney koee anya filmein likhi hain?	Acha woh kaafi accha hai. Tujhe pata hai kya Tina Feyne koi doosri movies likhi hai kya?
I'm not sure but she has been highly praised for this film. Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron was the main character.	mujhe yakeen naheen haye lekin iss film key liye unaki kaafee tarif hui haye. caddy heron key roop mein lindsey lohan mukhya paatr theen.	Mujhe thik se mallom nahi, par uski kaafi tareef hui hai is film mein. Lindsay lohan ne Cady heron ka main character nibhaya.
I don't want to get bored. Do you know how long the movie is?	main boor naheen honah chaahata. kyaa aap jaanate hain kii film kitni lambi haye?	Mujhe bore nahi hona. tujhe pataa hai kitni lambi chalti hai  movie?
The movie is pretty long but just a normal length.	film kaafee lambi haye lekin samanya lambai kii haye.	Movie toh lambi hai, but normal lenght ki hai.
