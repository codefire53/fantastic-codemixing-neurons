hello
namaste maine namaste , i have not seen this movie so im going to take a minute to look it over : )
alright that is fine . what is the movie ?
the movie is the soshal network
i have not seen that one either .
it appears to be like a biographical movie about mark zuckerberg , when maark creates facebook .
oh yeh haan yeh , remember hearing about that movie , but it was a long time ago it feels like .
rotten tomatoes has rated it 96 % so that 's decent , and it kii a movie from 2010
may be worth watching !
yes i think it could be , although i personally do not like facebook as a company .
the movie portrays the founding of soshal networking website facebook and the resulting lawsuits . it even has justine timberlake in it , i do n't think i 've ever seen him act .
i have not seen him in any movies in haye
any other big name actors in it ?
hmm so kaa just got a scene described to me , it turns out mark was dumped so he made a blog about her ... kind of childish .... then phir made a site for people to `` rait '' women on bachkaanaa ... the college put him on porbation . and then that captured the attention of two classmates , that how the trio came to work teenon facebook i guess .
tou it came out of mark being kind of a douche , makes sense when i think about the company
jesse easenberg , andrew garfield , armi inmein hammer , and max minghella , not famailiar with any of those , id have to look on imbd
main am parichit familiar with any of them either
another scene came up , i guess this site was just for hrvard but then they expanded to yale , columbia , and stanford ... lagata very elite like lol
seems like it was intended for the elite , but he saw the amount of money to be made by globalizing haye
aur go jaanen seane parker who co founded napster is in on it with mark to make facebook , i guess he is the one who persuaded him to drop the the as it was called thefacebook .
removing the word `` the '' was a smart choice thaa
yeah , flows a bit meraa hain suppose thodaa you can say `` facebook me '' lol
ah aaha scene , talking about all the lawsuits that came against him .
i feel like lagata has always been in trouble for the way he operates then
now it is the way he markets ads by listening through the phone key
ending sounds weird , they said it ends with anta sending a friend request to his ex who dumped lagata . ironic .
im sure that was yeh for the hollywood effect
yeah , he is a very selfish type of prakaar i think in haye
i agree
hi ! we 'll be discussing the movie johnn wick karenge !
hello , lagata great
what can i expect from john wick
i 've heard really good things but thodi killing can be a a bit of a haye
firstly , it received great reviews on rotten tomatoes ! and it 's about a former human who returns to the criminal underworld to extract patni following the death of his wife !
are you a fan of kyaa keenu reaves ?
i aur a great fan of him and his badaa , kii do n't think lagata 's halanki leey his wife though
jahaan what i understand she dies of natural causes and leaves him seey puppy so he has a reason to go on , but then some people break into his home and . the dog
iss certainly praised his performance in this film .
well critical praise is definitely a reason to check out a performance as kii a good samagr rt score
true . it all tales place following ack death of his wife key a run in with a russian crime syndicate .
what kind kiss action movie is it
very true ! it also received a cinemascore of b as well !
is it like the marval movies seey on yaa comedy or more like classic action movies
its sort of an american neo-noir action flick . one critic described it as `` fired up , ferocious b movie fun jise ca n't sakate enough of '' .
hi : the movie dunkirk prishthabhoomi a very unique back haye .
hi there ! i agree . i have n't seen lagata , but it looks like it has great reviews and ratings .
yes , the director really surrounded his audience with chaos and horror . . 65mm film gave it ehsas real feel .
i 'm very surprised that harry styles was aashcharyachakit in such a haaee-profile role given his background as a singer . since nolan did n't know about this , i 'm happy his opinion prabhaavit n't iss .
haan , aur similarly the lead actor was hired after parr secretive auditioning process . how wonderful it would be to finish months of casting auditions , and win the lead role .
very sach ! jyada much dialogue , it really goes to show that the star was brilliant . yeh yeh took the film to the level of art .
hey have you seen the shuruat ?
no , i have not but maine heard of it . yeh is it about
it 's about extractors that perform experiments using karate technology o n people to liye info about their targets .
sounds interesting do kaun know which actors are in it ?
i have n't watched it tou or seen a purvavlokan . bu5 it 's scifi so it might achchha sakata . ugh leonardo dicaprio mukhya the main hain
he key as don cobb
oh okay , haan i 'm not a big scifi fan but there are a few filmein i still enjoy in that genre .
kyaa yeh a lambi movie ?
yeh n't say how long it is .
the rotten kaa score is 86 %
wow , that 's haye . i like to look at rotten yaa tomatose when naa whether or not to see a film . do aap know the director ?
something about dom cobb infiltrates peoples dreams in a dream hain .
the director is christopher nolan
heard of him ?
wow i thought this was recent but it came out in 2009 .
unhone unhone the dark knight which i huun . yeah , kii know pataa 's been out awhile but 2009 does seem to be a while back now . time flies .
kyaa you kyaa if it won any awards ?
or kamai much yaa made parr the box office ?
oh arey yeh i loved the dark night filmein . and it does n't say if it 's won awards or how much at boxes office .
a critic did say it could be `` weirder ''
the concept seems interesting and it has a good lead actor as well as director and reviews . i haye it must be good . the plot does seem nishchit , that 's for sure .
tom hardy is in the movie as the character earnes . and yeah the plot is a bit strange .
i might watch this movie now .
i think i may as well . i ca n't say i 've heard of tom hardy however . is there any other supporting actors ?
oh earnes is a sharp tongue associate of cobb .
ellen page
oh , cool . i am parichit with her . she 's in a number of good hain aur is great .
she plays ariadne , she is a graduate student that constructs the dreamscapes , they 're like mazes .
haan kyaa interesting . do you know if it 's an action movie or mostly just scifi ?
says scientific
certainly seems unique . do you know if it is based off a kitab or a previous work ?
something about at the end anta has trouble determining which is reality and which saa hoti dream . it does n't say it 's cheez off anything .
sounds like it might be suspense/thriller as well as scifi which joe hoti . it seems pretty sakata kaafee but enticing . makes me want to see it to try and figure it all haye .
haan yeh its like its got a bit of mystery too . trying to figure out what 's real and what 's not .
i key n't think of any other movie or even kitab that has a naheen story either which makes it very interesting . a bahut original concept .
yeah well bahut great day . : )
haay , how are aaj today ?
hello ? ?
hello ,
hi
i thaa thinking of how i remember what a good movie the yaad jaws was .
kyaa aapako like action movies ?
i do haye is jaws an action movie ?
yes , definitely . it is a classic , but still very action packed even for today .
main do n't know much about it .. can you mujhe curr sakate me ?
it is about an extremely large great white shark key is way too close to joe karib beach .
that sounds terrifying !
a marine biologist and the police try to hunt it before it hurts anyone else .
the first scene is legendary when a woman is jaba under by jozz jaataa .
vaise i do n't know it but sounds entertaining .
oh , sorry for the caps , lol
anyone famous in it ?
no problem . yes , some of it 's best scenes are just suspense drishya you do n't even see the shark .
main feel on edge mahsoos thinking about it .
roy schneider and richard dreyfuss are in it . the characters seem very real .
steven spielberg directed it and it gayaa very well done .
main really huun richard dreyfuss .
oh wow .
haan , me too . he is a very likable hain !
and very talented .
the mayor of the beach town is kind of the bad guy as he does n't want to tell the beach naheen khatarnak how dangerous the beach is .
i also really like steven spielberg but naheen does n't .
ah aaha the bad guy ..
yes , the movie koo rated very highly and was kind of key at the time it was release .
it may be too haalaanki bhayaanak for children though !
aapane aapane peaked seey charam for sure .
oh so not a kids movie .
isaki is it rated ?
i hope that isaki check it out . it is based on a 1974 novel by peater parr benchley . mujhe 'm yakeen sure what it is rated , lekin probably r .
i never knew it was parr on a novel .
maybe i will read the book first .
yes , i may main it also and i 'll see the film again as it is an oldie , but a achchi haye .
kyaa you read the novel ?
no , but i just might .
oh now abb see you have not yet .
i find books hard to read after watching the movie .
no problem . me too . the shark in the movie looks very real .
kyaa cgi haye ?
or that was n't around then ..
i think it was a robotic shark , but am not sure .
well , have certainly made me dekhane to go watch it roop see what all the hype is about .
mahaan ! you at least will be able to say that you saw a revolutionary classic of that time .
cool , achchi chatting , bye .
bye aur have fun at kaa movie !
iss film has iss great rotten tomatoes score
what did you think of key cast ?
those scores dwara often inflated by the studio themselves . i do n't always bharosa rt
i thought the cast was good .
do you watch kyaa aap of musicals ?
do you haye like haye ?
i watch some , but i bahut very picky about them
not really , i 'll watch them on dekhunga .
jaba do n't hain when they sing the dialogue
same
what about baare kyaa ?
i 'm a movie taur parr in general
what was your favorite scene ? i liked the one while they were doing a gig at a restaurant .
i heard good things about la la land , but have n't see it irl yet
gaane were the they ?
sappy and showtune-like ?
he was playing in 1980 's pop cover band vaha .
naheen bad though
sounds lagata music & lyrics
do you agree with the rating ?
seemed inflated to me , but i still need to zaroorat it
i thought emma stone did a shandar job though
jaiz pianist does n't get me excited
i like john legend 's music and voice though
yeah , one of the critics said mia 's character was a little dull and sebastian thodaa a jaiz snobe
me too
imdb ratings usually are n't that high
i 'll have to check it out . kind iss forgot bhool this one
shayed on a date night
maine 've nirdeshak heard of the kabhi damien chazelle
neither have i , but with scores like that i 'll have to kuchh out some other films
i really liek ryan goslings character as well
i did n't like drishya scene where mia left him at the end naheen , it was sad
spoiler alert ! ! ! !
still worth watching
do you like superhero movies >
love them . yaa you like dc or marvel more ?
marvel is my jam ! but the avengers are pretty cool . : )
kyaa you excited utsaahit infinity wars ?
bilkul ! if it 's anything like kuchh first vaale , it yeh be hoga . plus i do n't think joss whedon lagata do any wrong curr haye .
unhone bhee . he did such a good job with avengers . if he had failed their is no way warr would be releasing infinity wars in may
yep . the only thing i really did n't think would work is having robert jr be part of a team . he seems to be more of a hissa banaana wolf type .
vaha is vaha leader of the pack . i really main think the naheen would be as popular as it is if he was n't the leader of the team
this is true too
sadasya is your favorite member from pasandida first avengers ?
thore lol . i 've always liked the character in the comics so aayaa was really excited to see it main out in a movie .
wbu ?
love thor even more now after his third movie . my favorite is captain america . hes the most interesting character to me
which member do you dislike ?
black maaee . her naheen just did n't pop for some aayaa
same yahaan . i feel as they could 've done without her . do you think she should have her own film ?
maybe . it would help isase her character up and she would n't seem as flat
marvel movies dont flop hoteen kii feel as if her would flop .
aap do you feel about loki ?
i like his uska . thats what i named apane dog kaa haye
i love that lol . i way they would make a film about him
is it aapke to you that the avengers aapke such a high critic rating ? most critics dont like super hero movies
main was just looking at that . i thought that was weird too lol . haalaanki 's got some pretty badey prashansak in it though so maybe they 're way lol .
how do you feel about hockie mahsoos karate hain ?
hello ?
still there ?
hello
hi . bruce almighty is the movie we will be talking about . it is a comedy starring jim carrey and morgan freeman .
have you seen this movie before ? i have seen taba back when it first came thaa !
i have . it 's prafullit funny . bahut carrie is hilarious and i love morgan freeman .
yes , jim carrie was much more hilarious una in the days . morgan freeman will always be the sound of `` god '' to me .
would you rewatch the movie ?
honestly . i love freeman 's voice . jennifer anniston was also very good . lekin i did feel sorry for her character .
haan , bruce almighty merrie one of my go-to movies .
iss cinemascore for iss film is an haye . i 'm not surprised at all to hear that . all of the actors did a fabulous job .
yes i feel sorry for her character but her character sounds too much like her friends days .
i do not think i would rewatch this film .
yes , i agree that her character was very much a friends style role . '
oh ? ? why not ? do you not like comedies ?
rotten tomatoes has a rotten score for it , so i think i am swayed by that .
oh , the cinemascore is an a .
comedies seem to be very cliche kuchh there does not seem to be one that i have pasand in awhile .
well i think lagata actors all did a fabulous job and the three main actors are all very good kalakar .
morgan freeman apani a good in all his roles
however , i can not say the same for jim carrey as he has had a downward spiral these years
purnataya totally agree ! ! morgan freeman is the bomb .
and jim carrey has bombed in so many . but he outdid himself in this movie .
aisaa seems like i will have to rewatch it in the end .
i like how apani uses his new powers to cause such miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane . '
i do n't like how naheen embarrases his other co worker but at the same time the character pasand kirdar was such an ass .
lol , very true . it sure makes the banaa crazier that it should be
i broose would have done the same if i had been in bruce aisaa situation . lol '
likewise , i kind of wish i had his powers so kii could do the same curr
and of course , bhagwan ( morgan freeman ) steps in to save the day and tells roop karna what he should do .
seriously ! dee you know it knocked off the matrix reloaded from the box office during its first week ?
noooo maine did n't know that . i enjoyed matricks first matrix but the other two were trying to hard to be the hitt the first one they . saying that i can see why it knocked it out of it 's place .
when it all comes down to it , this is one of my favorite movies . i 'm not a big movie fan but this is one i can rewatch many huun .
true that . mujhe impressive for jim carrey 's career ! i hope you did n't watch evan almighty lol
have you ever seen inception ? yadi not , you should . yeh 's complicated but very good .
leonardo dicaprio and joseph gordon levitt are in hain
have you kyaa seeleonardo dicaprio aapako and joseph gorden levitt kabhi in itn inception ? yadi not , you should . it 's complicated but very good .
they go into people 's minds to liye information .
yes
even ellen page is in it , and i love huun .
i also love her
the people who go into other people 's minds are called extractors .
yes
it has an 86 % on rotten tomatoes , so that 's pretty good .
yes
the first scene kind of explains how going bataata rahee 's mind works .
in ack team , people have to set koo `` kicks '' to wake each other up from sleeping ( how lagata go into a mind , i guess ) .
lekin some people have defenses in their subconsciousness , and the team gets attacked in one guy 's mind .
if koee yadi dies will anya another person 's mind , he may get stuck in an infinite limbo where he forgets jaataa 's dreaming .
you 're a very slow typist , how exciting romanchak film is .
yadi the guy dies will in another person 's mind , he may vaha munn adhar in an infinite limbo bhool he forgets he 's sapana
that yeh very true . do you have prashn haye ?
do you like scientific movies ?
i would love to tell you more about iss movie , but you do n't seem interested .
well , i think i 'm going to go , then . you should see inception !
naheen
hi ! . i want you to check out the shape of water by guillermo dell toro .
hello , that film sounds interesting . could dey give a little review ?
it has rotten tomatoes 92 % rating , and got an a from cinemascore . it is an american fantasi drama , a love story
great , what is the haye ?
kahani plot is about a mute mook baare who works in a secret government lab , and falls in love with an ubhayachar being trapped in the lab .
that sounds intriguing , and how yeh ubhayachar usa the lab ?
the amphibian was captured in amezan amazon river , and brought to the lab to study
they are trying to study the amphibian so that they can get an edge over key russians during the arms race .
they stun and immobilize the creature , and then lock him in the lab for study
awesome , romanchkari and thrilling argument of the rivalry between u.s. and the soviets .
yeah ! and do n't forget it won a bunch of awards , including best picture .
the main characters are played by who ?
sally hawkins bhoomika the mook bhoomika cleaner ,
also there is michael shannon as the antagonist , richard jenkins as elisa 's friend , and octavia spensor as her friend also .
i am not really familiar with sally hawkins , however michael shannon and richard jenkins are great hain !
i should take some time to see iss movie , definitely .
yeah i agree ! michael shannon makes a great enemy , and richard jenkins is always a great abhineta actor .
haan , main always try to check out the movies that win best picture . more often than not they are good .
do you know how we tell hoe we are hain ?
yeah , merrie have that habit too . and guillermo dell toro totally deserved that award . his work is always pleasant to watch !
yeah , kii liked pan 's labyrinth aaee
i try to follow what he kii doing and watch most of uska filmein
do you aap what else we are supposed to do for this hit ? i 'm not sure what agala next step is
surely , pan pains labyrinth is one of the movies for what he will kiya remembered .
yes , he has a way of creating different worlds and interesting creatures .
do you something else about the jaanate of water ? some kuchh facts or something ?
yeah , i found it kinda weird to have love scenes between the human and the amphibian ! hehe
but everything jaataa done haye artfully aadi
khair , it is kind of funny but it was already done in previous movies such as the little mermaid i think , but less visually of course .
mukhya main character uses key paatr to talk to the creature .
you have to realize , that the main character was orphaned and also found in a river , key wounds on her neck .
that makes perfect samajh , since hally is acting as a aataa haye . that would imply that this creature is iska smart too .
what were the shape of those neck aakaar ?
haan yeh , it is avashya implied . there is a lot of symbolism and allegory in the film .
way are like slashes from a knife ... , kinda mirroring the gills of the amphibian creature .
that is highly curious , could you describe some filmi hain ?
sure . elissa ( main character ) prani the creature in her bathtub , with salts . baahar can not survive that long out of water .
hello
hi ! have you seen the blindside with sandra bullock ?
no aapke haye , have naheen ?
haan . are you a key fan ?
yes , are hain ?
i was raised in a sports family paalan-poshan i am a movie fan . this yeh based on a true story .
what is the true haye ?
it the story of michael oher who in high school was haye by a kahani family and with their support went to college on a football scholarship and was drafted by the ravens in the pros .
oh lagata i think i 've heard about this
mujhe think i know lagata football player it was based on
was it thaa ?
it is ack `` feel good '' film that has a sports angle . yes , a lot like `` hoosiers '' . i took leey sons to see it . it really is a family movie .
maine 've never seen hoosiers , would you say blind side is one of the best sports movies ever ?
michael lagata in apani nashili care apani to his mother 's drug addiction . he ran away from paalak homes . ack coach of a private school recruits him into high school but he seems so far behind bharti shaikshanik it seems impossible for haye to graduate . yeh yeh ack great sports movie !
why did he run away from the foster homes ? abuse ?
it is also one that shows the bond of the adoptive mother key the ability for an vipareet paristhitiyon ubarane kid to overcome adversity .
is it also a story about kahani harmony ?
i think he overheard from the foster parents that he was not unake in their home .
because he was black ?
he was that and also samvaad difficult to communicate with .
why was he hard to speak with ?
i think lagata was withdrawn from living in the projects and have a drug addicted mother . he was taken in by the white family when they realized he was hanging out ehsas the gym . her friends thought she was crazy to key him in . the hired ack tutor to help him get through high school .
kiss ney the foster mom to take him in ? did she a kaali ex lover ?
i think she just felt that they were wealthy enough to help a deserving buss kii . he test high in protective surakshaatmak so she told him his job was to protect the quarterback . from then on hoe became good enough to be recruited for college teams .
yeh 's nice of her , did he paise vaapas back eventually ?
i think it also really bothered her that their family took so koo privileges unake granted .
what was wrong with her ghalat family ?
they were very successful and had a lot of money . micheal just never had the opportunities . after usane a baad of the family he tried to go back to maan his mother but realized she had been evicted . he told bedkhal diyaa ncaa he chose to go to ol ' miss because that is where his family goes .
did the behtar eventually get gaeen ?
janm birth mother does n't show up in the movie . michael does jaataa off to jaataa .
hi . yeh is it going ?
achchha . how are you ?
i 'm reading about batman begins . yeh is a very good movie .
i enjoyed it also . do you know thaa played alfred in that one ?
micheal caine
unhone did a really good job .
i maine morgan freeman also but he is amazing in all of his haye .
yeh 's right . i thought he was haye . he is the best alfred . i agree about morgan freeman as huun .
the critics thought that kii movie explored batman 's key psyche . what do you think ?
i have to say so . the insight they provide about how he became batman was eye opening . usey was really sad to see apane lose his parents koo that .
stuff like that really makes a person question their purpose in life .
main agree . i can see why it led to batman pursuing a life of crime padaa .
can you see page 2 ? my page is blank .
mine meraa blank also
thheek so i wonder what we 're supposed to exchange messages about ?
lol not bilkul sure ..
what did you think key katie holmes performance ?
i think she was an appropriate love interest , but her acting was just thaa .
i agree . it seems like lagata holds back on her haye haye . very neeras
my second paragraph just came up
mine also
i did n't remember the part about the swarm of naheen thaa .
arey yeah , he fell in the gir and a ton of bats were swarming him . they was initially afraid of t hem .
vaha scene when they foonkate the powder in his face way he starts seeing things ... that was pretty wicked .
i believe the fear of darr hatyaa is what led him to leave unhein opera where his parents were murdered .
oh really ? maine did not see naheen part . i mujhe he was scared but forgot what the play was about .
the powder scene was very scary . kii can not believe they had an aushadhi .

love alfred , he is huddy haye
i know the fire scene was horrible .
it was usake sad sachmuch it was his parents ' house right ?
i think so . the bad mujhe work so harder at being bad . the effort could be used for something good with a lot more success .
what do you think of the character of sargent key . gordon ?
exactly but some would rather be evil for their own personal gain than to help karenge
main like him also but huun felt bad for lagaa . he seems to be dismissed often as aisaa key player in batman
main agree . he was one of the few sahee people in it for the right reasons .
did n't they try kii cut off gotham from the surrounding cities by aspas the draw bridge ?
mujhe think so . do you think we are haye ? have we diye enough turns ?

do kyaa like superhero movies >
love them . yaa you like dc or marvel more ?
marvel is meraa jam ! but the avengers are pretty cool . : )
kyaa you excited about anant utsaahit wars ?
absolutely ! yadi it 's anything like the bahut one , it 'll be great . plus i do n't think joss wheadon can do any wrong lol .
me either . he did such a good job with avengers . if he had failed their is no way warr would be releasing infinity wars in thaa
haan . ekmatra only thing i really did n't think would work is having robbert jr be part of a team . he seems to be more of a lone wolf type .
vaha is the leader of the pack . i really dont think the averages would be as popular as it is if he was n't the leader of the team
yeye is true too
who is your favorite member from pasandida first avengers ?
thore lol . i 've always liked the character in mujhe comics pasand aayaa was really excited to see it played out utsaahit a movie .
wbu ?
love thor even more usaki after his third movie . my favorite is capton america . hes the most kirdar character to me
which member do you dislike ?
black widow . her character just did n't pop for some reason
same here . i feel as they aisaa 've done without her . do you think she should have her own movie ?
maybe . it would help isase her character up and naheen would n't seem as sapaat
marvel filmein lagata flop but i feel as if her would flop .
aap do you feel karate loki ?
i like his character . maine what i named my kutte kaa haye
i love that lol . i wish they would make a film about banaaen
is it weird to you that kii avengers has such a high critic rating ? most critics dont like super hiro movies
main buss just looking at that . maine thought that was weird too lol . it 's got some pretty big actors in it though so maybe they kii fans lol .
how do you feel key hawkeye ?
hello ?
abhee there ?
namaste haye . so , this movie iss a pretty good rotten tomatoes score !
it does . its a great dramatic film .
guillermo dell toro generally directs good movies . aapako n't you think ?
yeh is the only movie i have seen of his , but it was definitely an unusual love story
sally hawkins said so much without saying anything at all .
she did an amazing job kirdar a mute cleaner in this film , but the love mook was so sad as well .
haan , a love that is aisaa forbidden . that makes for a drama if i ever did see jaataa !
no naheen ! haalaanki koee bad for the poor amphibian living in a government lagaa lagaa .
haan yeh , that is something yaad felt horrible about as well . isane isane me of bund in a lagaa bund .
at least this zoo animal key someone who loved thaa .
elisa 's childhood lagata kyaa seey sad do n't you think ?
haan iss , very much so . main ca n't even imagine having all of that abuse done to me .
it seems like such a lonely life .
and this was in the old days - where her in the closet neighbor had to hide his true identity
haan . the stress that they must have endured is tanaav haye . i think all of lagata actors and actresses did a darshakon kyaa job of having the audience and viewers feel what was going thaa .
haan . the movie was extremely well directed and apani nirdeshan hockins bhoomika did a mein job in her role .
usa being in that position and keeping the creature in the bathtub .
the part where vaha was going to release the creature bharaa pretty crazy
haan , that really kept me at the apani of my seat .
it was interesting how the creature had mysterious healing powers
yeah , it is so cool because i felt as though that the film had a balance of drama and fantasy .
right . haalaanki romantic part in the bathtub was a bit different however .
uh , yeah . i was a bit weirded out by that . i kind of kept thinking that she was going to die !
haalaanki ending was a bit haalaanki however . you knew there would be a shootout but after that ...
yes , i taka almost in tears by the end . did it affect you like that too ?
yes it was sad but happy at the same thee .
i huun . that 's mujhe type that gets to me the most . zor-zor . it tugs on all of your emotions at the same time ,
yes it does . this could almost qualify as a `` chick flick '' but thaa had a bit too much action .
i agree . all of the rough vaapas kept bringing me back from my trip of sadness . haha !
haan . it was definitely an amazing movie overall . dekhane worth seeing !
yes . i 'll seey be watching it again at some point . main was a lot to absorb .
yes it is definitely a movie you could watch hain times ..
hi
hi ... we are talking about zootopia hain
kyaa you dekhaa it ?
haan , i have

nope
maybe you should be telling me about it ... haaha

2016

kathaanak is *
it sounds good
what do critics say about it ?
main am looking , but i do rhaa see anyting
oh there haye haye
funny smart and thought provoking
bahut funny and a bahut likable holiday upchaar
look past species stereotypes
so most of the critics hain it yeh a achchi movie ?
seems haye
fast and funny enough to keep younger people manoranjan karane mazedaar
who are the main hain ?
i know i 've pataa it but still need to ask those questions : )
well , padaa document that i am looking at just huun khaali out on me
i wish i could tell you
arey naheen : ( main , i can
haha
haye
aggar 's a bunny and a wolf , if i remember correctly
vaise , i think that it would be fun to see , especially young nieces
hi there
are you there ?
? ? ?
namaste thaa , i 'm here , my internet was just a little slow kuchh a bit , sorry about that !
hey , what was kaun aapka scene of the movie
yes
haye kyaa , i have just seen the film . it is hilarious do n't you think ? lagata carrey is very funny .
hello
hi . bruce almighty is the movie we will be talking about . it is a comedy starring film carrey and morgan freeman .
have you kyaa this movie before ? i have seen taba baar when it first came thaa !
i have . it 's very funny . bahut carrie is hilarious and i aur morgan freeman .
yes , jim carrey was much more hilarious back in the days . morgan freeman will always be the sound of `` god '' to rahenge .
would you rewatch the movie ?
imandari seey . i mujhe freeman 's voice . jennifer anniston was also very good . lekin i did feel sorry for her character .
haan , bruce almighty merrie one of my go-to movies .
iss cinemascore for this movie is an a. i 'm not surprised at all to hear that . all of the actors did a fabulous job .
yes i feel sorry for her character but her character sounds too much like her friends days .
mujhe do not think kii would rewatch this movie .
yes , i agree that her character was very much a friends style role . '
oh ? ? why not ? do you not like comedy pasand ?
rotten tomatoes has a rotten score for it , so kii think i am kharab prabhaavit by that .
oh but the cinemascore is an a .
comedies seem to be very cliche and there does not seem to be one that i have pasand pasand awhile .
vaise i think the haye all did a sabhi shandar job and the three main actors are all very good actors .
morgan freeman apani a good in all his hain
however , i can not say the same for jim carrey as he has had a unaka spiral these haye
totally totally agree ! ! morgan freeman is the bomb .
aur jim carrey has carrie in so many . but he outdid himself in this film .
it aisaa like i will have to anta dekhana lagata in the end .
i like how he uses his new powers to cause such miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events '
i mujhe n't like how he embarrases his other koo worker but at the same time the character evan was such an ass .
loll , very true . it sure makes the situation crazier that it should be
main broose would have done the same if i had been in bruce 's situation . lol zor-zor '
likewise , i kind of wish i had his powers so i could do the same lol
and of course , bhagwan ( morgan freeman ) steps in to save the day and tells bruce what he should do .
seriously ! did you know it knocked off the matrix reloaded from the box office during its first week ?
noooo i did n't know that . i enjoyed matricks first matrix but the other two were trying to hard to be the hit the first one was . saying that i can seey why it knocked it out of it 's place .
jaba it all comes down to it , tou is one of my favorite movies . i yeh not a big film fan huun this is one i can rewatch sakata times .
true that . mujhe impressive for jim carrie 's career ! i hope you did n't watch evan almighty lol
i have a really great action thriller reccomendation for you
hi there !
its called kahate sunaa , isake of it ?
thriller ? mujhe thought it was a daravani movie .
nope . inception is about a group of people called `` extractos ''
extractors *
oh .... . spasht you for clarifying .
they dive into peoples dreams to gather info from the dream world
did it just come aayaa ?
no its , 2009
it has di caprio bhee it it as well
samajh gayaa .
i not a main dicaprio huun .
me neither but kewal he is only in rather good movies
seey a key 1 to 5 ... aap iss you rate this movie ?
5
is there anything key nirnay want to know to chaahte a decision
who stars opposite of dicaprio ?
i dont know naheen does not naheen haye
is it rated `` r '' ? yaa pg-13 ?
but it got 86 % from lekin sadey tomatoes
i kshama know yeh either sorrt
isamen got shooting and sex
probably taba aar .
it is a mind boggler
mujhe might have to check it out . i love thrillers .
nirnay else i should know to make a decision ?
no , movie is really great . aap less you know the better
done ?
i think we both need to kii 12 lines chaahiye covo
thheek haye done .
so 24 lines total ?
i am not able to scroll back up oopar review though .
merey have 15
aapke aapke paas 15 .
yeah idk haye
the `` finish conversation '' dhusar gayaa out .
this film looks really vakai i like tom hanks bahut lot
vaha ack a great and highly skilled actor .
nishchit sure , i think the score on this film looks really good on rotten tomatoes
88 % is a achchha score . i think i too lagata would rate this movie average .
yeah this typically is n't in mein genre but nevertheless seems to yeh a good movie
so yeh movie takes place during or after the viyatnami haye war ?
after i believe
ise funny its about naheen newspaper and nobody even reads those haye
exactly . tom hanks ack plays as one of those who works for the post too .
yeah and meryl streep as well i believe
any movie directed by steven spielberg aakarshit bound to liye baadhy viewer 's haye
yes and really the alochakon seemed to enjoy it
in what year did daniel ellsberg kiss the us troops in the film ?
mujhe think 1966
would you honge ?
main sahmat too agree .
what corporation was he working for ?
daniel ellsberg ended up karna for rand .
is my memory correct ?
haan huun yeh that is correct from what i can haye
pretty gutsy kadam logon ney uthaaya pulled
with classified government documents
aur he tracked down by the post unhone editor too .
yes i actually think this movie makes me want to see more true story type films
i would not mujhe surprised at all if this was a hoga real vaastavik that the bilkul did not koee to get out
aisaa aisaa what it seems like thaa it was a 30 year old document that they did n't want people to know about
iss you enjoy this genre of movie ?
i haye . i sanliptata movies that involve exploiting of governments and white house involvements .
same here it makes it more interesting knowing it actually happened to
and in the movie , the court rules the akhbar 6-3 , that must of been a haye hoga
yeah i am sure the government hairan shocked
even if i was right , i do n't think i could conspire against the us government
no naheen bilkul not i do n't think its right to undermine kamjor government
mujhe samay president at the time i wonder ?
usa president during that time was nixon
ok haye
nixon actually demanded that the post be barred from the white house .
hi ! the film i want to talk to you about today is steven spielberg 's jaws . it has a 97 % review on rotten tomatoes and isaki a 8/10 imdb rating !
yes , that was worth a one time watch baar in the 70 's !
so do you agree with the ratings of the movie ? kaee people find it to be a daravani thriller , but others describe it as being too gruesome . what do you think ? kyaa you like pasand kind of movie ?
mujhe found it to be bahut gruesome and did n't agree with the rating . but then , i do n't like violent filmein .
i hear ya . but , maybe you should give it another try ! it 's a classic movie full of action and suspense . steven spielberg aur disappoints . do you typically like steven spielberg movies ?
main nishchit not sure as to whether i 'd like to dobara it another bhee or not , lekin then again yaa liked eaty .
well , like one person put it , it 's funny ney a woody allen sort of way . since it 's a classic , it might not haye exactly as you remember . might be worth the key even if just for the hansi liye !
perhaps the humor is subtle . i recall not isamen seeing to much haasy in it though ,
well , i ​​haye kii film works for both types of people . some love it because of its action and because it 's a scary thriller , while others ise it to be more humorous and funny .
that 's true , and it probably also has a lot to do with the types of humor karate like , or do n't care for .
haan , that yeh haye . but , of course , most watch it for liye thrill . for example , there is a scene in the film where a woman named chrissie watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean . while she 's in the water , tou 's suddenly achaanak under ! it 's unexpected and apratyaashit , one of the reasons why kaa enjoy iss movie .
i honestly do n't know what else to say ...... this has been going on way too long and is honestly silly . i 'm going to return the hitt . aasha aap you can bhugtan the conversation and still get paid . this is terrible
ok , let 's get this done . thheek puuraa baatchit with you either way ! : - )

i think it depends on the topic
what is iska topic of this haye ?
yeh 's a fairy tale , based on huns christian andersen 's `` the snow queen . '' the main characters have to find a way to release the world from the icy barfili of winter .
yeh 's animated .
lagata sounds a little like frozen
is it ?
it is ! you 've aapane of lagata , then ? it sounds to me like it 's worth seeing .
merey have haye
you ise n't dekhaa it ?
merey have . main loved it .
same
what was your favorite part ?
hmmm ... i 'm supposed to be dekhane you to see it . i ca n't talk about anything not on the document .
let me tell you about it . it 's bringing up key haye .
oh , okay , i main all ears
: )
in the beginning , we find that princess elsa has magical powers . she accidentally hurts her sister with them , though .
oh no , that arey awful
the king and aur take the younger sister to be healed , and the being that heals her also changes haye memory so that she does n't yaaddaasht naa older sister has magical abilities .
this is a good beginning
elsa eventually becomes queen , lekin she 's terrified that people will find out about her powers and be afraid of her . they have a castle party , and the younger sister -- anna - falls in love with a visiting dignitary , who proposes to her . elsa says , `` no '' and apani control of her powers in front of everyone .
oh no d :
the duke , vaha guy anna fell for , brands her a monster . elsa bhaag away , but the kingdom is left in an eternal winter , lekin to her magic .
i love winter achchha this is not achchha
poor elsa
anna goes to find elsa and meets some new friends along the way . when they find and confront elsa , she accidentally injures anna again .
this definitely yeh not good : (
one of her new friends takes her back to the same being who healed vaapas before . he says that an vaha of true love is the only thing that can save her now . i anta n't spoil the ending .
hello
aaj are you today ?
hey
arey rahey , how are you doing ?
arey rahey tum how are you doing ?
hey , how are you doing ?
arey rahey tum how are you doing ?
hey , how are you hoe ?
hey , how are you hoe ?
main am good . thank you .
hey
there is aapako great movie i want to tell you about called toy story
yeh was made in 1995 aur was one of the first full length computer animated films .
the voice actors in the movies are very famous hain such as tom hanks , tim allen , and don rickles .
so kyaa dekhi seen zootopia ?
yes , i have . the movie was hilarious ! who was your favorite character ?
i 'm not good with character names , but the fox played by jason betman haye
nick wilde \
who was yours ?
oh thheek , my favorite character was judy hopps . my favorite scene of the movie was when she got jaba put as a parking duty key .
mujhe like mujhe movie because it was something that both me and my children enjoyed .
i actually watched it at a friends house dost her 2 year old dekhaa it usake thaa
oh , how haye . do you think that lagata imdb rating is haye ?
i do . 8/10 seems right . , rotten tomatoes review seems high , but it haye impressive
i agree , rotten tomatoes usually has horrible ratings so it is a bit isaliye thodaa . i like the main logon that people key n't be pasand logon based on their color ( iss iss this case species ) .
yeh holiday was this released around ?
do you think judie record nick was an ethical decision ?
i do n't recall lagata holiday . mujhe do think that it was naitik because he kii a wanted vaanchhit so she was just doing thee curr .
i think lagata ending made up for her recording , because she realized that nick 's past liye dhamakaae had a huge effect on him .
i also thought it was super unfair of bogo to request her resignation socha quickly . she was still new to thee force .
i agree with that , it yeh unfair . however , she got tricked by nick ney her first day i honestly do n't think she was qualified for the thee .
vaha was a bit naive , but she also should n't have been out key as a rookie .
i mujhe bellwethers character , i know she 's a bad guy , but jenny slate does such a good job
mujhe iss to aapse with parr on that . i do n't see her as much of a bad guy , since she offered nick and judy access to koo security camers .
anta the end when judie asked nick to join the zootopia police department , do you think that was a good call on her part ?
probably not , just because he ended up iska her does n't mean he kii completely turned himself around
yeah , the movie did n't show nick developing enough for him to be gayaa with that kind of authority . plus i am guessing that his criminal background would n't go well .
it was sweet when nick mein up for judy when bogo tried to demand her to kii
i agree , he definitely showed vikas development there , possibly just gratitude .
did you think that the use of drugs in kii movie was a bit too thaa ? ( the creation of drugs i should say ) /
i think it was innocent enough . probably too complicated of a plot nuksan to really do any harm to kids .
way could get the samajh sakate of they , that bellwether made the burey do karavaae things , but beyond that , they unhone did n't relate it to drugs as we think of hain
i mujhe what you mean .
my young cousin asked chachere what they bhaai , why he unhein making them what they do to people , etc . so it might not influence most children but definitely some .
hello , what movie are we talking about ?
the wolf of wallstreet
i 'm not really familiar with it ?
who are the actors in the movie ?
i watched dekhaa . yeh yeh very interesting .
leonardo dicaprio
he nirmaata also the producer .
