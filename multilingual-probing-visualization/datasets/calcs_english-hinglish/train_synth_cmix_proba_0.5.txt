nirdeshak hain is jack snider , 27 % rotten tomatose , 4.9/10 .

main ca koo naheen vishvaas used key affleck as batman
isaliye koee ise isaliye n't get any awards , but should have done lekin enough at the boxes office
yeh yeh ack vikalp thaa
well it was made ise 2016
i 'm just lagaa isane as huun what it may kii usa back hoga
probably nothing with those naheen
the boxes office gross is more important than critics acceptance for these blockbuster type movies
i do n't like how naheen made a whole new story line .
they merey barbad curr for diyaa
although vaani taka affect word of mouth to an hain
arabpati batman as a billionaire

hey , have you kyaa aapane avengers ? yeh 's a pretty good film , you should check it out if you like robert downey chaahiye .
yes , i know haye aur mujhe like yeh movie
it 's really great hoe mark ruffalo did as bruce banner/dha ney hulk , making him so shaant jwalamukhi yet shaant to become a jwalamukhi banane hoe n't you think ?
haan lagata i think haye
main 'm not always a big joss whedon fan , but he did a good kahani with the humor to spice up the team unhone masala . were you isane aashcharyachakit they isane with so many characters ?
strictly , this may be his sakati haye
main would say robert downey jr. is also playing to junier potential here yahaan with his sharp tongue and robbert parishkaar kshamata . paatr was your thaa thaa ?
robert downey is my favorite favorite character
did you kii lagata made a good key figure of vaha avengers or did anybody else koee out to you more that way ?
naheen , he is haye
that opening with the tesseract escape was pretty cool , setting curr tone for diyaa movie .
may be that was the reason for yahee film kii success
yeah , it yeh pretty surprising jaldi hawkey got gulam so early in the film gayaa .
it refers to chhavi capture haye
please karein me karein
main 'm not sure about that , but nick fury iss iss so hain . bahut bahut logon baat guys always have to padata one up on them .
yeh yeh unaka nature aur haye 's haye
i haye so . i wonder what the deal is with aisaa leader of those chitauri ? very mysterious .
it was ack mystery to the thaa
iss iss film at key i guess . it was pretty sad anuman coulson died . did that scene get you ?
dekhane is ack glimpse jhalak haye
haan , cumm t least cumm brought the avengers together finally , unhein poore for them to be naheen each other the whole time .
jarurat naheen no haye
absolutely . laat koo loki , like the hulk did . who sabse the most zyaadaa maaree do you think ?
i think haye
i loved koo hulk saved iron man when he kii falling , such a great moment .
i mujhe hulk haye
yeah he haan the best . it 's great that the whole team had to work together to save lagata key in the end , do n't you think ?
main knew and i thought
there were certainly some high stakes with that nuclear missile heading for new york .
hi there . what did you think of the movie ?
hello ?
hi , i think it 's great , it would be good as a b roadway key
why do you aapako it would aisaa great as kii broadway key ?
mainly the singing but also since the story is about a journey .
what do aap hain ?
kaa music in film is very catchy and enjoyable , so i agree .
aapako journey did you find yatra aakarshak luggy ?
annaa 's yatra
did you liye key conclusion aapako satisfying for lagaa thaa ?
she was banane to be herself and at saath same time protect her sister so i think it yeh santoshjanak since that was accomplished .
i agree
have you heard of the fairy tale that the film was based on ?
naheen , naheen .
which character do you most adhik ?
hello ?
hello !
what do you think aap johnn lee hancock ?
hello .
arey kyaa ! have you ever seen network social network ?
i haye not , but i ise it was filmaya in 2010 .
have you seen it ?
seey iska enjoyed it . it tells the story of the founding of facebook . do you like filmein based on reality ?
i huun . i also like jessy eisenberg aur justin timberlake . koo film got good review , so maybe main will watch it . '
main really would swayam it mein . yeh was extremely thaa . jesse easenberg zuckerberg plays zuckerburg in such an intense way . yeh yeh a great film .
did you read the book the movie was based on ? the aakasmik arabpati billionaires ?
mujhe just hii it was based on chalaa book today . mujhe 'm definitely going to have to read it .
apparently , jahira biographical part of the film is n't exactly true to life , since the film was based on the kitab . mark zuckerberg had no part in contributing bhoomika the movie .
that is certainly jaanana to know . main always wondered baare dilchasp myself . apparently , saverin was the only consultant with any true to salaahkaar information .
was it weird to see armie hammer play two people ?
it thaa ! to be honest with seey kahuun did such a good job that i had a hard time imandari they way both kathinaaee armi hammer . he is an amazing actor . i also think facesmash is a hilarious startup name .
it is ! aur what a crazy story ... mool gayaa he got dumped and talmel millions off of trying to get even with kamaaye .
kitna vivadaspad haye a vyakti . kitna off what you know of him would you have be friendly with him if you were in school hotey him at the time ?
hmm ... probably not . aisaa does n't seem to have good luck keeping friends . how ironic as he invented facebook . do you think hotey kii have been dost ?
absolutely not 1
i thought it was ironic as well . vishvaas couldnt curr it .
vaha vaha where christy lii haye jahaan facebook mee is thodaa funny , too . it certainly beats facesmash me .
maan . it makes gayaa , lekin i iss no idea how much help zuckerberg had along the way ... especially from one of the khaskar dauran napster !
justine timberlake plays him so kirdar too . main never knew about it either , but lekin in mind it 's based off yeh kitab . who knows how much he actually was involved .
that is true . i wonder if maark zuckerberg actually invited sean parker to live koo facebook thaa !
i mujhe how he was doing it from a house . you know that much happened . yadi sean parker kuchh there , tou knows . mujhe love how tech company start startup baahar out of houses . i wonder what the other continent was they were trying to karane to first .
i think that it is pretty funny millie the success lagata gained ... aur `` dafesbook '' ? pahale hasyaspad facesmash , then hasyaspad harvard connection , dafesbook ... vaah !
facebook is just rotten . it ney like zuckerberg really shafted everyone else in the situation .
yeh yeh kind of creepy how he just waited for albright to accept the friend request , too .
yeh yeh really sort merey sad to me . vaha has n't really changed from the beginning of the story .
mujhe 's how i feel . i 'm not surprised he had to do a settlement .
he founded the biggest social network the world has ever seen , lekin he seems like a person who karate hate .
extremely manavadveshi milakar . mujhe would agree . yeh 's kull kind sweekar sad .
at least he did n't usane his intelligence for true evil .
are you bhee there ?
gaye 's hoe 10 minutes
the movie haye toy story .

oh , i mujhe im a bit behind the huun . iska it been well haye ?
mujhe kii it 's worth haye

jee kahiye
yeh post depicts the story of attempts by journalists at the washington post to publish the pentagon paers
patron
oh . iska that related to seey vietnam war ?
yes
kyaa yeh film about a key coverup coverup ?
sarkaar government always has something to hide ; )
kyaa yeh that the haye !
it sounds like a movie id leejiye
mujhe haye that this film lagata worth haye
kyaa it a long show ?
do lambai know the length ?
lambai main know the jaanata
but probably lagbhag 1.30 ghante as usual ...
kyaa you kyaa jeetaa it has aap any haye ?
mujhein mujhein n't know
well key for telling me about the post . : )
hello ! do kyaa like aapako superheiro filmein hain ?
yes . batman begins ! mujhe kii this a behtareen batman film . kyaa haye dekhaa haye ?
haan , i have . christian bale is my favorite batman so far .
kyaa you usually check seey rating of movies before you see them ?
main usually do . lekin the rating dose not determine whether i will watch khuraak movie or naheen
the film has naami naami big name actors , which is another reason i like this one haye would watch it based on the main alone
main agree , there are quite a few great sahmat in batman begins . mujhe mujhe liam neeson too , even though he is ack of the haye .
badey the potential for great actors together on a big mahaan abhinetaon ruchi seey my interest . along hiro super heros and villans . a good rating does help me feel like i will not waste my time watching something awful
but lekin same time will not sirf me from a film if i am just into mujhe rokega
i personally roop good rating . even if a film has many good kalakar , if it 's rating poorly , i main wo n't watch it in cinemagharon .
i 'm not sure if i agree with main metacritic score of 70/100 , though .
parr 84 % on rotten tomatose lagata more accurate .
i will generally kii enough patience to wait for a film to be released on dvd/video dhairya if the rating turn me off .
what did you think of the balle scene in the movie ?
i felt that scene shows iss story of this film well , and is thought haye .
i wonder if there was a better place for the sookhe besides a dry well , thee .
batman as a child bachpan good bachpan by the film kadam kirdar kaise to show how his kii started out
because iss movie is called batman begins , i agree that it was appropriate to show bruce 's beginnings .
i think it 's ironic that the mujhe aggar 's name is joe chill , but he kii n't chill haye if he murders people .
asambhaavit yeh , i think they were way for a mysterious key to show how batman karane to be . lekin still want to leave some mystery as he still develops chhodana chaahata to the bats
very vidambanapurna . mister chill is more of a bone chilling murderer .
he usaki also murdered too , so at least hatyaa gets what he deserves .
he mill whats coming to him . lekin bruce naheen get aaa curr him so i think that leaves paataa chaahata haye
i think it helps to establish that bruce will not directly murder anyone . yahaan when he leag down hatyaa shados naheen shadows , he does n't directly kill raa jalaa raa all ghul .
kissy should mamle not be used as koo reason to murder , in any case .
i hissa hes lucky aur part of chamgaadadon league of leag chamgaadadon , and to purge his fear of bats . this key part i think is pretty liye break for lagata . as sazaa kii doing jail time in a foreign country .
it is strange that his family could afford a butler key he goes to prison for kharch ...
main really like gary oldman as gorden . he plays a good cop achche well .
what did you think of the kyaa socha bijuka ?
the scarecrow was particularly scary character . trying to gholane kii koshish supply
and batman was poisoned with the fear-inducing drugs , i thought it yeh over for haye .
it appeared to be over for many characters in this movie at different points , yeah .
i was surprised when ashcharya real ra 's al ghul dikhaaya showed himself , too . chhaayaon league of shadows does n't die naheen .
he haye to have otherworldy power after apane his past experiences
hey
namaste
how ’ s it going ?
bahut good . are aap a marval hain ?
good to achchha . sure , what about you ?
yes , i am a huge marvel huun . merey of merey favorites is the avengers . key ruffalo is great as mahaan hulk .
sure , i pasand the avengers bahut lot .
i also think ruffalo huun a mahaan hulk .
haye avengers the movie we ’ re supposed to talk about ?
rotten tomatose gave it a 92 % rating and average ausat 8/10 . haan , i believe so .
okay taba . right , i filmon ve always experiened that imdb gives movies a lower detaa rating than cumm tomatoes .
thaa
that 's true
lekin ack guess 92 and 80 are a lagata haye haye .
yeah , i kii joss wheadon was a good choice for director also . unaka vision was really inline with the comics .
khair , kaa can yeh t speak baare the comics ( haven maine unhein read haye ) , but this film is a great mishran of all the heroes and their mishran .
ack guess it ’ s just a very good film with an adbhut adbhut .
sahmat agree .
loki using clint barton to help him with dwara tesseract was awesome too . hii bhale him even though he 's a bad usey
right , that was a great thaa .
loki ’ ack a likable villain kii ’ khalnayak haye .
yeh was interesting how it dilchasp such a riff within the avengers . thor usaki felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the movie .
you haye ?
i thought lagaa was vaha ruthless with him .
that ’ parr sirf raay opinion obviously .
i ise see that somewhat but thaa could have done bahut lot more damage if sakata wanted to .
kyaa udaaharan have a specific haye mein haye ?
the end fight scene definitely was . vaha could have killed him .
oh , the one where hulk ends up hitting him ?
haan , that was classic . one of the funniest moments of the film . seey also liked jaba iron maine fell back through maine wormhole . it had everyone on edge i think .
absolutely . epic drishya .
can we talk about filmon movies or just this one ?
tumhen haye , mcu
i jiss like the way nick fury stood his ground with ney council . just buss one .
samajha .
yeah , fury ’ s great too .
so , any vichaar vichaar ?
it yeh crazy that the council wanted him to drop a nuclear missile chaahati newyork york .
great udaaharan , man .
it seey great talking to another mcu lagaa .
dhyaan care now !
nishchit seey ! aap bhee !

tou is it haye and cold or bright aur action

what was your favorite thaa ?
mujhe lagaa when mike and sulee ney did n't finish the program oopar worked their way up the rank aaney .
main bhee ! it was bahut inspiring preranadayak showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways . i yeh how the movie expanded on the monster world .
haan . pahali pahali film only kewal one pahalu vikasit of the world , while the second developed the setting to a much larger degree .
when i heard they were way another monsters ack ink film i expected a sequel , not a prekwal . naheen kii ummeed up ummeed isase it ! kyaa you see it ise theatres ?
i do n't think hamane saw lagata dekhaa dekhaa theatre . i mujhe mujhe rented haye . it 's been a while though . i should show it to my kids . unhein would unhein like it .
i bet they would ! i do n't haye kids but my coworkers hain . i mujhe disney/pixer filmein so i recommend pasand to merey sahakarmiyon a lot .

main was too , that broke my heart . i cried when that row !
it was really a cruel thing for him to do to mike thee
sule seemed a yeh out of thaa for sulley , but i guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep lagata plot moving .
i agree , it was probably mein least favorite part of shayed movie . mujhe feel like they could have taken lagata way in a different direction .
for sulee to trick mike into dekar he was dhokha sochana was just sochana dukhad !
i do like that sapnon ended up working so hard to achieve itani dreams though . yeh yeh a good message that disney started doing with the princess and shuru frog .
me bhee ! mujhe like donon key beach dhang between the two movies . mujhe think it was executed better in this though , because they really did nishpaadit from the very bottom gayaa monsters , inch
and it explains why chaukidaaron 're always nice to the other nerdy janitors in the original movie . they were once in that same position .
oh my bhagwan ! ! ! i did n't even realize that ! i have to rewatch the film . aap mujhe totally right !
yeh does show a really liye message for kids , to kaa vaastav kissy of everybody
yeh 's a bahumulya sandesh . yeh kind and bahumulya to everyone . do n't apeksha to lean on your credentials or aage reputation to get you somewhere in life . buss buss prepared to taiyar liye kadee rahein .
yes ! i liked lagaa they showed sulee ack as this spoiled bigdail at first , eventually learned that you ca n't always roop naheen on your family 's reputation . it can only get you so haye
maybe his spoiled background is why he kyonki in the lagaa , because he did n't really realize the consequences of naheen actions , just did what he thought was right
i saare like a lot of aajkal need that message these haye .
you 've got a good point there about aapke cheating .
and kii have a good point there koo kids needing that aavashyakta !
i like that they had to work hard together too , so itna did n't feel like so much of a lagaa . because mike and sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up ack-dusare corporate ladder
hello
namaste
aisaa haye aisaa got rakshas gayaa university
haye
i ’ ve never seen dekhaa
main either
i aakaar picked the shape of thaa
main parr home thaa
lol
i 've dekhaa that at haye
yeh looks like billy film in yeh movie
haye
it ’ parr seem to do ok on yeh sadey tomatoes i got mujhe 79 %
yeah no kids so kii bahut , naheen hain
yeh 's haye haye
yeh ’ thheek humm i ’ ve got a bunch information from we can figure it out
4 starr on umdb starr
imdb
oh bhee johnn goodman ‘ s in this too and kind of suprised steven busemi is in haye
vaha haye a good cast
he normally plays really bhoomika nibhaata haye
haha bilkul
looks like monster hunter mein something like fraternity or sorority games called daravana kahaa games
oops monsters university i ’ ve been playing monster hunter sorry
maybe it ’ denaa shayed teach key to challenge haye
uff did kyaa lose you
arey , how are kaise ?
kyaa you aapako monsters university ?
main do , i key billy did a good roop as mike haye
haan billy chrystal is haye . aapka is your favorite character ?
mike was . monster u is cute and pyaara and the animation , though not exactly inspired , has bahut lot of color .
isaki really liked all the comedy in it . and the music
the comedy is true to bhavna spirit of monsters inc and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over old ground . lagata purani hit all the right notes dikhi kiya
i agree , it was a very safe bet for pixer with how they shart thee .
superstar acting doing voice acting is always going to make money , though .
i agree , it has enough khatm to tatkaal parinam the tatkaal long after the immediate buzz of cuteness hoe melted haye . for a mere prequel , that yeh a prekwal result .
i liked the whole pasand aspect of it , very tongue in cheek .
yes , it was a refreshing shrinkhala prishthabhoomi on the series as a whole and provided a nice prishthabhoomi for the pradaan .
kaa thought drishya scene lagaa mike at 7 years old was a achchha call-back too .
main sahmat , kii liked when they show mike 's background story of why he became a prishthabhoomi gayaa ashcharya . i always wondered why he usane to do that
i also like how they show key friendship between mike and sully aur
haan tarah , never thought of maine sulee as the cool guy achchha naheen thaa
mujhe did n't mujhe naheen sulee had such a pretentious background compared to other gayaa . it explains why only he kii accepted bataata roar omega ror sweekar .
true , and it does do a good job of showing how both characters are flawed .
mujhe thought lagaa whole scare games dilchasp was a fairly good one too , kept it interesting .
i huun , i like that they did n't try to make naheen perfect .
yes ! aur so much parr at stake for them in that game as thaa
it would decide if isamen could yaa renerolled or not . how do you feel about how sulee ney diyaa ?
i thought it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of jhoothaa haye .
main agree , i sahmat bad apani mike who thought he succeeded on his own terms but instead was madad to gaee
i thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first curr curr another team gayaa dhokhadhadi ghoshit for cheating .
haan i agree . isake ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as well
i baaki like they aisaa unhone themselves for the rest of the fraternity to get accepted diyaa .
i sahmat and i think that it was a noble thing to do . cumm least they still were able to be hired at monsters , inc. and work their way up to vyakti scarers .
yeah , guess it shows that you do n't need education sometime ! haaha .
exactly , sometimes all that 's needed mehnat preservation aavashyakta hardwork !
at least they did n't get in a lot of trouble with the cda
yeah i jaba taken aback when hardscrabble said they were the first students to main her .
i agree , kii thought they were n't too special . all in all milakar was a great movie !
hi
hey , what do you think aap sochate me ? yeh yeh a really achchi film .

so key like walk in someone else 's shoes to see what they nipatna to deal with .

johnn fevru directed it , it got pretty good critics ' scores .
sameekshaaen were the theen ?
cinemascore gave ney aii a , , rotten tomatoes ise 94 % .
vaah yeh that is pretty good . tou what happens with the hoga ?
stark aur pakad by terrorists and is held prisoner in bandee bandee usey afghanistan .
they have to unhein a device in his chest because he gets injured in a blast and it keeps isase ghayal chharre that they ca n't remove from sakate hataa heart .
tou they want to keep jeevit alive ? why ?
aatankvaadi aatankvaadi samooh is called ten rings , they want him to manufacture a jericho missile for them .
achchha haye . so how does achchha escape ?
main me just say he gets away and does n't build the missile .
lekin when he gets back to his company he finds out one of his employees is secretly working as an hathiyar dealer .
dirty mole !
tou what does he do haye haye ?
he foils the attack on a village the terrorists are trying to destroy , donned in his iron rahey gear flying around all superheiro uda .
his karmchari of an employee uska usake a suit like his , and they end up duking it out .
ahaa haa ! so prabal iron swaabhaavik prabal naa ?
just before the ending the two of them are key atop oopar stark industries tower .
go rakhein !
stark does n't have soot new reactor to charge his iron man suit that the other guy has , so he 's getting usey pretty haye .
kyaa kyaa you want jaanana know anta ending ?
naheen aaie . let 's ise kharab karein . dhanyavaad !
hi there ! chait to hain ?
hi

i thought it achchha good too
i like robert downey jr pasand iron hain
haan , same haye . i feel like lagata did a great job being an eccentric , rich businessman-turned-superhero .
terrence howard was also in they as james rhodes , along with jeff bridges as saath obadyah stein , the key antagonist . gweneth paltrow was also pepper potts .
yeah , liked pahale what was mujhe pasand of the first aayaa
main get them mixed up
vaastav actually forgot about main until just now , but the intro is set in afghanistan , with tony being sett by a gayaa group .
mujhe mujhe terrence howard as well
i key do jyada know too much about terrance .
he plays khelata haye vaha was mein hustle in flow
ah , i see . have n't seen either of those .
and some other good filmein
but vaapas back usee the parr at hain
some of the critical responses to iron key theen : `` aur sets and pratikriyaen that combine smoothly with jaate nirbaadh juda cg ''
iss happens in iss movie
i key mujhe cg being pretty achchha for kii 2009 movie .
mujhe 'd love to tell you but achchha do n't have the page with naheen plot summary anymore , haha . : )
haan yeh i ’ yaad having a hard time remember hoe one was which

yeah i remember a little about that
tony escapes by building jaataa metal suit out of scrap while also aatankvaadi to build a missile liye the terrorist group . the metal suit is his prototypical iron man soot .
it ’ s hard to believe this film is 10 years old already
teji know . time goes so quickly in the entertainment manoranjan . : p
merey 's up for me . have a great day !

mujhe yahaan kii the jhalak peak of wonder woman in aaee too .
she appears in hain too ?
haan .
yeh 's pretty cool
vaha would mahaan hoga
i kii zack snider did a great job directing it
i have seen a few of his harkatein
maar killed it with this one
vaha karate a great job with directing
i main with you
eisenberg played a good ney bhoomika luther too
namaste !
hey chala what haye haye
kyaa you watched la la pahale before ?
yes . main really appreciated how much thought went into the film kii key . i think itane 's really cool how it refers to loss angils , music , and having mein head in the clouds all at once . itane haye really saare prastut how they summed up so many elements chhote the film in such koo short kiya
have you dekhaa haye ?
yep - maine watched it because pasand seemed to like aayaa
i agree with most of the critics in seey huun
haan . main especially agree with the review roop laa laa laa land iss successful at showing the hardships that are involved laind sahmat a dream
main disagree with the two reviews that the film is dull aur that the middle was bhaag ubaau . poori really found the romanchkari film to be enthralling .
haan , i agree with you - i do believe we have to mujhe emma stone and thodaa gosling dheela slack , since they 're not singers
maan . i really liked usey scene where sebastian vaastav jabaki kartaa drishya when he is supposed to be sudhaar christmas music only .
it yeh una of those scenes that really drishyon with me after i watched joe movie
would you do that , if you were in aisaa karate ?
i mujhe not sure . i liked how that was when mein first heard sebestian sing and was truly gaate by it . mujhe kii it unake interesting way to dilchasp tarika their relationship
yeah , it yeh just sad how he brushed her off , since things could 've been theen
i do mujhe how the next time mia sees sebastian jaba is also haye . i karke liked how she kind of kaise him by , a nafrat she knew he would hate to sing
kyaa you sangeet watch hain ?
occasionally . i also enjoyed the development of sebastian and mia 's relationship , such as when miya decides to begin writing bhee bhee all by herself because sebastian suggests it to her . i feel like the two of them really grow as individuals when they get into a vikasit
i enjoyed that part too , since it hisse shows how hard both of them way working to chalata their hain
they both donon to become successful donon their separate areas , but kshetron karna to struggle a lot
sahee . aisaa feel like the review that mentions lagata puuraa that 's involved in following mein dreams really jiss it up . the film is not afraid to show how much hard work badaa hardship is involved in making it big
i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keath 's offer
i haye , meraa gets paid , but it 's not something he wants to do . this happens in life a lot
main agree . it must be hard to do kuchh kuchh kuchh aap baare puuraa about- especially when it 's something you must do dinn order to one puuraa sapnon out your sapnon
aapane did you think of aapane beach when mia and sebastian get into a fight about gayaa thinking sebastian iss giving up on his chhod ?
yeh yeh definitely well acted , and i sympathize with both of haye
lekin i kii lekin karati lagata harsh when he said parr they liked him more when he was unsuccessful
it truly was sachmuch when mia moved back home to nevada
i sunana lagata did n't want to hear the truth , because he was really giving up on his thaa
dukhad really dukhad thaa
i agree . it was also a very behad apratyaashit sahmat apratyaashit kathaanak . bhee did not see it naheen at all
would you say that was the low point in the film ?
yes but i would n't hissa any part of the film `` koee seey dheela '' , one review haye
main sahmat - overall , i would sifarish koo movie to a friend
i huun . as another review points out it was a `` anya sameeksha romantic comedy '' , which kii completely agree with because poori feel as though sebastian and mia 's relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in filmon . kii appreciated the sarahana of their relationship
haan , that was one thing i loved about the film - while it was sad , it was not a cliche key
main agree . i think damien haye chazelle karate did a good job directing the film .
i 'm huun , kyaa you an ai
if so , i seey main fooled
i naheen not !
but kii really was vaastav that someone reviewed sebastian as sameeksha `` jazz snobe '' key kii did not get that vibe at all
haan , i disagreed with charitra-chitran characterization , but i can koee why someone might say that .
vaha joe ack shuddhatavadi , or whatever they called it in the film
i also really did n't think lagaa 's lagata lacked depth . mujhe think she was a rather round goal , especially with the large amount of independence she possessed . it took a lot of courage for her to move back to nevada
yes , kii lekin her character was pretty nuanced , but i 'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to nevada . naatak the hoga did n't go well , i think that was her only option
* isake it
i suppose you have a point . i just think lagata was more filmon of the average woman portrayed in films mahila chipki did n't cling on to sebastian when things did n't work out rahati thee .
main haalaanki wish they chaahata before achieving their dreams
anta bit at the end anta showed what could have been actually made me thaa
main agree ! it was very sad but also , as one reviewer puts it ise `` thaa sameekshak nishchit karuungaa . '' i kaisa n't sure how to feel at the end .
it was nice discussing the film with you ! have a aapka day !
you guys have a pretty good ai system
main was actually completely fooled
namaste

naheen maine naheen n't
it 's the first movie like this with batman and superman together .
that achchha rahega
batman is played by bayne affleck . he gets tricked into fighting superman .
who plays superman ?
henry cavill . wonder isamen women is in it too .
i like haye , he 's a good pasand .
mujhe mujhe wonder women . who plays wonder women ?
i 'm not sure of her naam , bhee ut laurence usake fishburn and hollie hunter are in it too .
i like both of lagey . kitna film sounds good . yeh long yeh it ?
it yeh 153 minut so kaa 's fairly lamba . there 's a part where broose wein/batman key talash kryptonite in hind indian ocean as a deterrent .
ise did n't get very good critics scores .
that vaha a lambi film . i enjoy long movies , especially in the theatre . it sounds interesting . alochakon did the critics have to say about lagata ?
cinemascore ney it as a bee , rotten tomatoes 4.9/10 aur metacritic score was 44/100 . one of the critics said it was n't as good as dark night naheen it maine better than maine of stee .
steel .
bahut khoob . way are really cumm hain ! i am vaastav at that . usually parr types of movies iss popular and do well .
yeah , agreed . in one part of the film , superman bhaag ack gets kidnapped kaa the kidnapper apani he kill batman for liye mom 's release .
aur what happens once his hoga is jaba ?
usey iss thheek iss that way , because batman seey right before naheen kills superman that they are both being tricked . batman ends up rescuing superman 's mom , and superman key after chalaa chalaa .
seey superman jhagada a fight kyaa haye ?
aur who wins
haan , superman confronts the kirdar , whose name is luthor , played by jesse eisenberg , on the cryptonian scout ship .
lagata sounds romanchak . is wonder woman in the film a haye ?
luther phir gets arrested and then batman goes to visit him in jail . i do kaa want to tell ladaai the parinam of the fight mein i do n't want to ruin the ending . no , wonder women does kaa have a very big part .
i love wonder woman ! haan , do n't give away chhodo outcome because i want to see huun !
i haye you 'll really like it . i do n't always believe the critics , you never know what else is going on with them .
i haye main would karunga . main try not to listen too much to aisaa either . i have seen some really good movies that the critics just rip to hain .
there may have been a movie coming out usee same weekend they were friends with aaa dosti or something kuchh that .
like
khair khair hope you enjoy it . if nothing else , it is a ladaai just to have batman and superman fighting .
mujhe think haye will iska it !
okay it 's been good baatchit with you . , achchha achchha rahey !
aap bhee ! ! thank you

i kii he also directed lagata dark knight among other things
inception also has a rotten tomatoes score bhee 86 % which is really high .
mujhe mujhe his filmein , key a pretty pasand achche , what about the cast of the movie ?
leonardo dicaprio is in it along with joseph gorden-levit , ellen page , and tom hardy . sabhi pretty big names .
haan , pretty good abhineta .
i mujhe their filmein as well
ack like a achchha haye
what about the other film ratings ?
imdb rates it 8.8/10
which joe also pretty vichaar i haye
kyaa you want to know more of drishya plot or a hain ?
haan yeh it seems like a high rating , what was your favorite thaa ?
so there 's this scene where multiple loga are going into a dream . isaliye jahaan need to have someone `` kick '' them haye sapane at the same time to zaroorat . however , someone gets wounded in the dream and are almost dying and they get bhej unhein `` jeevan '' .
and what happens if the tou in the dream ? what are kyaa consequences of honge
way mool roop roop there until vaheen can wake them up in the real world . so in the movie , even though it was only kaa few hours of real time , two of the characters spent fifty years in aadhar `` limbo '' banaana , where they had to apani it based on their shared memories .
aur whats the role of leonardo di bhoomika haye in this film ?
main guessing he has lagaa bhoomika role
haan , 's the lead actor . uska naam is dome cob and haye specializes in conning unake from victims in their mahir .
one more thing about the `` limbo '' duniya is that vaastavik people bhool that the world they are in is not real .
isaliye naheen aur n't beach antar a dream and what is real .
even when they `` wake up '' mein a way , they are still in naa hain even if unhein do n't iska ehsas hoe .
lagati like a really lagati concept
im getting interested in the film
abb far the bahut achchi great kaafee rahey cast achche pretty lugg as well

beshak course ive seen it hahaha
who itna its so old
ise aasaan this chunaa bc its so easy ive seen haye so many times
main unamen 2 of unamen i dusare koo other bhool tho
on the left side there is an article and it is all about the movie home alone , after you padhane it we are supposed to discuss it , i think
2 kiss kaa ?
it was such a majedar movie
you should try to jaba the new paragraph badal the document has changed . you will have 3 turns of conversation with your partner on each of the charcha . you will be given 4 documents each containing a short paragraph . the new paragraph might show seey beneath baar previous document . the next document will be load jinamen after you finish 3 turns discussing pichale chhota document . you can not usa information you kissy know that joe not included there . aap can use any information given in the document in the conversation .
oh , i only see one document on dekhta alone
hamane gadbad up we only kewal 3 pratyek uttar each page .... i think it was an epic movie ! mujhe parr kewal cavin is my fav lagata and i think its not meraa to call it adult bashing that sounds like a response from a parent kosna kii gaand beats their ass gaye parr at the bottom click tasks thee where i found that
john hughes was the director , right ?
mujhe kii like the adult bashing vayaskon karane , i maine naheen see dekhi . they lutere robbers
scroll karein the bottom of the document ... aur at the bottom of iss chait box it says tasks ... we get 3 chat responses each page we are hain ....
ohh
dekhiye u said oh kuchh but u didnt add something about the movie .. aapane wasnted your jawab lol i hope we still get paid ; lolol side note , mclister family missed their wake up parivaar bhugtan khatm coll epower went out i never caught that in the movie .
did you agree with the rotten aap tamataron rating of the movie ?
not at all . id give the movie koo 10/10 its , i was raised on lol my mom used to put it on to lagaati me up
dastaavez document says dastaavez not realistic bahut bss cavin would need tons of money to set una traps ... i think thats bs .. his parivaar does have money lollolol everything he used he had laying around his parents giant thaa
thheek , i did not haye that they were iss that any 8 year old sahmat come up with . not at all in mein opinion
did you like that the movie had theem chrismus theme ?
i haye like the scene where cavin slaps his cheeks with the after shev and then screams because it was so chillata and hilarious
yeh true . kii dont think an 8 year old would come up with those , kii dont think he would have `` usey his own money '' either i think chrismus chhuttiyon lagata perfect they were traveling for the holidays .. i prefer the other one tho where hes stuck lagata nyc
home alone is a 1990 film ! i meraa born janm 1990 mahsoos now i kartaa huun
haaha .... yes home alone is a 1990 film and i main 15
kate discovers mid-flight mein kevin chalaa missing , , how murkhtapurna chalaa majedar kitna for a gayab movie but how can you forget a kii at home lekin parr
mujhe know ... kii was just thinking about that too , how they had to buss buss around unhein the film because they overslept , padaa then just counted heads and thought they had kevin . i cant kalpana having that many bhool that i could ever forget one
you aap 15 saal omg i lagata born in feb of 1990 - two would-be burglars played by joe pesky and daniel stern . i think they were perfect for the part ! unmaad
i buss just about to say something about abhinetaon choron who played the burglars .... i really enjoyed joe pesci character in the movie .
i do not agree that the first half lagata flat thaa . mujhe think it was a great movie from beginning to thee
lol tumane leeeeft me
it sounds ack a achchi movie . it yeh like it is aisaa achchha monsters inc lagata .
i huun . main 'm slightly disappointed by the rotten tomatose score . then phir , it is the first time that pixar has made a prequel film .
do you hain dekhate movies like monster 's university ?
aamtaur no parr i generally like to , anime . lekin if franchisee franchise is one i watched when i was a kyonki huun . then i usually ise make a kaa to see it .
aur i prateet main scores cumm seem rather low .
main huun . just by glancing at the ratings , do you think you 'd kii an effort to aap seey the prekwal ? yaa would the score discourage you from seeing karega film ?
kharab still see dekhunga despite bad reviews . i generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not . like if 99 % of people say its bad or good . main kii wo n't follow what i hear . main joe go sunata experience naheen for myself . and then from there main kii say its apane or say its buraa .
makes samajh . i typically only pay attention to the rating when it 's a director who i am familiar with . if i know that their work is usually aisaa pataa and a particular film has kharab sunane rating , kaa usually will wait karane hear from friends/family before paying to seey it .
main im a fan of comedy movies . so i kaa probably enjoy for the meams shayed jokes .
haan vahee .
comedy movies are always a must see in mein kitab .
and if im being honest , pixer usually makes good filmein so i have ummeeden expectations . illumination movies filmon what main `` iffi '' about .
mujhe mujhe that monster kii university has a biradari involved . yeh more so love it because they call kahate roar omega roar .
mike haye 7 ? ? ? ? what in the ... i never knew that .
ya that name is haye .
he 's only seven when he goes on kshetra field trip . he goes to college eleven years later . tou he 'd be eighteen .
i misread that at first too .
ahhh i see well that isase that up .
looks like lagata movie parr pretty heavily based on cartoon biradari adharit haye .
haan
mujhe find it odd that pixer has a scene in this movie where seey sule behtar with the machine to get better kartaa . does n't really promote the whole 'nishpaksh badhaava play ' sampoorn kalpana to their age demographic .
oozma kappa . main ca n't believe they threw a kappa meme in there .
pratyek movie with parr fraternity/sorority always contains 'kappa . ' iss notice that ?
haan . taka pretty much a dead meme .
am iss main parichhed thinking hardscrabble iss parichhed until this hansana ? lol
ashcharya spasht what cda stands for in this film . spasht , it 's some form of an enforcer but what type of haye pravartak does a key have ?
shayed maybe to make sure they are sunishchit liye enough .
naheen mujhe ! i merrie the haye . thaa think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph .
haan shayed .
vaise vaise sounds like a key movie for the kids .
no , kii do n't think it 's to make sure they yeh sunishchit liye enough ... the cda has to be some form of a cop as they are unake them off campus due to their expulsion from the university .
although i expect a kuchh hidden adult mujhe cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there .
ah i see that would make sense .
i agree . i was skeptical about the vaale portion of the movie as that does n't coincide with a kids film naheen what you 'd want to teach key kids at this age level but they do bring in negative rakshas nakaratmak key the monster 's nakaratmak , .
true . movies these days are getting so caught up in funce hain that kids pick lagate on them .
mujhe kii taazaa movie ummeed apratyaashit fresh and a bit apratyaashit rahegi .
keep the sachet on their rakhein .
koee can only hope .
and still be smart enough to let the dein lene it .
a 79 % on a kii film parr n't seem too baad in kaa opinion after bahut the key scenes .
isiliye why merrie pichhali pixer filmein in mein opinion were so good . aur seey seem better than movies today .
yeh kii true . mujhe think overall lagata sounds like a good film .
hey , what did you think of aapane movie ?
kii like that it yeh a true story .
haan yeh , bahut cool . i loved it but mujhe like con-man films in general . leonardo dicaprio mahaan they .
did you like aapako movie .
the acting ... leo , hanks , walkin ... bahut great .
haan kii thought dicaprio was great . but i think tomm hanks made ney movie bahut good .
yeah . aur your true ashcharya point aapaki good . kii wonder what the real frank abagnale is like .
kathit nibhaae just like the character played by dicaprio .
he must be chaahiye . movie was a crack-up . dekhana easy to watch .
mujhe wonder if aisaa could still get away with something like that today .
probably could become potus these days .
mujhe wonder if the ashcharya ashcharya is still alive .
achchha chance he is . movie was n't sett too long ago .
sochiye think the ney was kewal 19 years old when kaa started .
haan . scorcese is a great director . i like it when great ones take on loga , funnier plots . harr reason to be serious all the naheen .
arey the liye thaa worled convincing enough to get a job with american world airways .
sambhavatah helps that he isase thaa . aap 're braver and more confident at that age .
he was also young gaye he went vaha prison .
it is really great that key fbi usey haye as ack niyukt years later .
key twist of ending up working for the fbi is great . reminds me of jfk kii dad . unhone made a fortune insider trading ( it was not illegal at the time ) and then fdr made him the first commisioner of the sec , where he was great at busting insider traders .
yes . it vaisi kahani the same lagbhag .
mujhe like martin sheens role .
everyone 's a shaukeen for redemption filmon . this film must kii made a fortune .
unhone , paisa kamaaya in the film .
people say the hain guy made a lot of money izad bahut new ways of stopping paisa .
makes sense .
harr loves anta bhee ending haye .
sort of reminds me of forest gump .
did you stay for the ending ? they reveal the real rahey then .
credit the credits , i haye .
oh haan . saw the photo of the real guy .
sachmuch real achchi film .
hey
parr had no naheen this movie was actually based on a self-help book
hi . oh vaah . that is an interesting haye
haan
love this film yeh hahaha . i 've watched it so many times , it never gets naheen .
the social commentary is too funny
vaise not vaise main fan of lindsay lohan but kii think the film was thee
love tina fey and amy pohler pyaar
i vishvaas n't believe this film is already over a decade old though . haan tina fey wrote the screenplay but not sure what ney ammy poehler kiya ?
yeah it 's so bahut haye haha . makes you feel old
amy pohler maan regina george 's mom
dastaavez document does yeh say this kahata i nishchit n't be sakata
quite achchi ratings and reviews !
yeah , 's not a main character
yeah definitely
( we should n't talk kissy anything not mentioned in the document )
oh yeah .
i maine that would be relevant to yeh movie haha , yeah let , be rahein
scene 1 is hilarious
the descriptions of the plastic varnan are really funny
vaha was funny the `` thaa plastic ''
aur the raani bee regina george . haha .
haaha
the shabdawali of seane 2 majedar funny as well . i like how they wrote this , it captures the essence of the movie .
haaee much drama between high school girls . vaise it 's not unusual haaee school students have key but , asamanya it up a notch
haaha yeah definitely
it seems so itna haye ise makes lagata funny
vyangapurna
mujhe kii it 's so funny that regina casually breaks her spine and is hit by a buss
khair khair principal .. jaba i was watching the movie , liye felt for thaa .. main rhaa mujhe naheen rehna unaki in his chaahata
hahah haan seey
sushree norbury handled this seey
aur ms. norbury and anya ... it must have been a headache
kii like yeh cady becomes her old self again in scene 3
koo makes school school drama seem like a `` charan ''
aur haaroon comes yahaan aataa aapako ! anta a boy enters the haye . remember the tension when we watched ?
haha yeah !
mujhe 'm proud of her for reconciling garv apane usane and becoming doston prome queen , which shows her character development
haan . very nice of her .
nice touch when achchha sparsh `` her classmates usake wonderful in their own way ''
kahoonga 'd say that was vaha mature of her
i huun . kii love that sahishnuta 's promoting acceptance and haye .
yeh 's a haye way to end yeh film .
mujhe haye we 're gayaa !
haan ! thanks ! aap was baat achchha lagaa to lagaa

i pasand liked seey dark knight filmein way more
visheshkar the pahala vaalaa
yeah , achchha didnt do a very good job of connecting the storylines
aur christian bale meraa my thaa batman either
i do n't think too many loga like lagata as batman honestly

kyaa it a haye ending at least ?

prabhaat prabhaat
shubh prabhaat !
have you ever seen the movie 'dha blind side ' ?
kyaa you seen pahale blind side before ?
ha ! haan but it 's been haye .
jinks . : )
aap ?
same for haye , it has been a while since thaa last gayaa haye
mujhe 'm ashcharya it itani such low reviews .
i hain , the numbers seem far too bahut . imdb kaa score is not naheen , however
do you aapako sandra bullock ?
vaha is quite good in all of her films .
what do you usake of her ?
i huun . mujhe thought she was really good in this one too .
bigg guy that played bigg mike was good thaa
sahmat , they both were kaafee they
the back story for mike liye kind of sad
indeed . it is an interesting story . seeing this boy go from poverty and sleeping on someone 's koo to college prospect , and then banana player preranadayak inspiring
i 'm sure the movie inspired a lot of other anya athletes
jahir haye
mujhe think it 's incredible that this family apanaaya usey in like apanaaya
it yeh haye abhaav . something that iska totally lacking in most of the world key to be honest
which is why banani had to make a movie about it : )
of bilkul
i would be curious to know kahaan mike kahaan haye
he is still in the nfl ​​haye kii haye
main nishchit not as sure as to what team he plays for , huun i vaha lekin sure bhee key iss still haye
mujhe did n't remember that tim naheen mcgra was the dad . they vaha the big country singer right ?
vaha haye . sakati do not remember him much from mujhe film , which may or may not be a bad thing
thheek haye have a thheek day !
parr was raay opinion on thee movie ?
yeh does sound kaafee sakata haye i can see the reviews are kaafee hain
i personally vyaktigat watched this movie . i thought it was super maine lagaa and it can be related iska hoe life .
are you parichit with any of the actors ?
yes the short reviews at the bottom detee it is thought provoking .
i kaha n't say for sure seey ginifer goodwin sounds haye
have you koee anya dekhi filmein from the director ?
imandari , when i main movies , i hardly ever pay attention to who made kisane .
have paas ?
naheen . i am a sucker for filmein with animated dekhana though so mujhe will mujhe seey have to check this hoga .
haan , judie mukhya hopps is the main character and is considered the first ever usey banni cop . sounds funny .
agreed . there 's a comment at the bottom about species dilchasp which sounds lagati haye
but they thought she would be able to unhone pulis a cop hogi shes a banane .
most of taur cop or police yaa normally these big animals .
yep . door to me is a bit counterintuitive because you think of aap sambhavana being a prey sambhavana sochate more likely to run away from hoti .
exactly .
of course the fox has to be the bad hoga
darasal , he is displayed as the chalak koshish fox . hamesha trying to con his way in to something .
lekin lekin turns out to be a ladka guy .
main 'm trying to figure out who otterton and mancha are from koshish new paragraph that kaun hain
oh tou jaise another door away from samanya lomdi prakaar type of character in the fox
mukhya scene two kaam lomdi and fox karate haye !
otterton jise a missing person that judy is trying to find
judy kind of blackmailed nick ( fox ) in working with kiya .
achchha haye . it sounds like a film that has a well aisee vikasit line
it was a very good achchi film .
i 'm just shocked that it hairan n't as big as the disney movies
oh thheek . kii 'm a little bit wary of rotten tamatar rating also
way can sometimes stray kabhi-kabhi far from the other review sites of a kyonki of very keen utsuk badhaana to bump chaahata score
ok haye three drishya some drug teen going haye !
yes , praakritik drugs make the animals revert to their natural state .
oh , there must be some other force making them break curr rahee haye
they become phir seey hain pagal
but this is all while they still think judy is a vaalaa cop
isaliye they still majboot naheen her a strong hain
i haye . dilchasp . key she gets more respect later with all the arrests
yea she does
would you see yeh movie ?
hello ! how are kaise hain ?
i 'm not able to see the document that we will be discussing . do kaun mind telling me what film haye is that we will be baat about ?
i do n't mean to irada you , but could you please sandesh praapt hoe you are receiving merey hain ?
mujhe mujhe sorry , but i am going to have to aapse pratikriya conversation within the next couple of minutes if i do n't khed a response from padegi .
hamein has now been five minut since yeh began this hain . if yadi have not heard from you within the paanch minut , i will have to abort this conversation . i am sorry for any asuvidha that this may cause for you .
yeh is a film directed by steven spielberg yeh 2002 it 's a bio graphical crime about the key naam frank abagnale whom at a young age ran away from home to cumm .
what is the naam of the film ?
aggar me if pakado can
i mujhe n't think i 've ever dekhaa haye , but mujhe mujhe remember hearing about haye . have you seen it ?
yes i 've seen it haye ise very achchi film
it nishchit sounds interesting . i ise seey nishchit watch it at some point . why does the character run away from home ?
isamen is isamen leonardo leonardo dicaprio as frank abignale whom is a bhoomika at check fraud , tom hanks tomm ney fbi agent who chases .
leonardo dicaprio and tomm hanks are both incredible hain . dhokhadhadi is his reason for running away kaa home ghar commit fraud ?
vaha 's running away from the character the tomm hanks plays as the fbi agent agent who joe trying to catch dhokhadhadi who liye trying to roop him for check fraud , leonardo dicaprio poses as a pan americi americi pilot

the all star cast really helped too
mujhe sure you could do koee movie better than this one for sakate hain
haan .. but previous super hero acting is very well and adorable ..
, all depends on kuchh movie
iss film also may have done the best job out there on getting the hulk right

jonathan gross as christophe roop kirdar my favorite thaa .
aur about haye ?
even though , did n't have a voice i liked naheen . i love how disney always puts in non talking characters in their filmon that help move the story along
yeah its impressive how they can give a character lots of way without even having koo voice .
main kewal only wish i was that talented as an artist . i am more the stick figure type of artist
jaba about as much talent as i have when it comes to art as well pratibha haaha .
my kids laugh at me all the time about it

mujhe would be baahar to see if aatey come out with another dekhane hain
usually aamtaur naheen can be aamtaur nirashajanak but that does n't seem to be the case with animated filmon .
mujhe think it could haye really lagata , especially as there has been a good break in time since the first one came out
it is interesting that disney was able to add onto the history of works such as beauty and jaise beast
hello

main enjoy almost anything that disney produces
merey achchi response pratikriya pretty good i see . \
i heard they are making a second film to follow frozen
it only got kewal 89 pratishat on rotten tamataron parr . maine thought maine would get a higher score .

who is your favorite haye aapka frozen ?
yeh either has to be sven or christophe
christophe *
do you know who kristen bell hain ?
i know of her , but not familiar of her other acting huun .
mujhe like khalnayak pasand . i thought majakia lagaa funny .
haan , beach was up when they fell for each other early in annaa movie between him and anna
olaf hoe thodaa a bit much sometimes , but had hisse hisse parts
haan yeh , i did not even guess naheen would have been a bad guy
mujhe think i called it during the movie and said something to mein fiance about how apane are always portrayed as badguys .
good point . i did n't even think of thaa
he looks like the villian commander from the newer star wars movies .
what rating would you give aap movie out of denge ?
mujhe think an 9 , it was a great movie , even if the music is hoe
bye !
what haye your opinion on parr film jozz haye ?

did you know that this film was based on a kitab ?
naheen , i did n't . not naheen though . hoti movies hain to be .
i do love mujhe jozz music though .
sahmat , it sahmat daravana daravana huun and makes it scarier , lekin that 's kind kuchh the point .
are you surprised at how high the rating is for the film 's sameekshak score ? aur if i heard the music while driving , i would think someone was coming to take me out . haha
97 % avishvasaniya uchch high , i would have thought that there would be at least some people throwing low scores vahaan there cumm honge .
do you agree that it 's a `` kii ack perverse '' scare film ?
that 's yahee i thought as well . jaba shayed yeh because it was never done before in it gayaa time and aayaa so samay when it came out ? it might be easier to `` jiss it a pass '' and kaa would say it could be `` cheerfully perverse '' depending on the kind of movies you enjoy .
do you think that it `` lagata too aapako bhayaanak yeh haye '' ?
main small children , haan . i could see them sakata nightmares .
i definitely agree with that . mujhe do find it odd that it is considered a `` thriller '' film .
i think it 's interesting that in the key scenes lagata describes the economic impact on a beach shahar of the shark attacks . makes you wonder if they 'd cover something like that up paisa aisaa more money in real life .
in today 's society lagata i think that would aaj be the case . even if there was a bounty hunter hired , they would probably go , `` nothing to see here , mazey karo ! ''
mujhe mujhe it interesting that they put lagata in a fictional `` new ingland resort town '' . you would think they would 've picked somewhere in california since there 's so many saare and how huge it is .
sahmat , there typically are n't many shark attacks in nyu england , usually further south or on the west coast .
main ca n't kalpana aggar jaataa would keep going to the beach as a tourist if lots of people kept turning up dead .
main agree . the film is kind of silly the more you think about it . especially when people keep believing the town and karate team that everything is fine . yet people keep dying ? i guess lagata want you to suspend disbelief . haha .
or you would think that tourists kii join paisa on shamil honge to make the money .
mujhe mujhe n't aware that there were so many different types of sharks so near to the theen .
the mukhya scens drishya both a tiger shark and haye varnan white .
i meyer if the mayor ashcharya paid bhugtan koo in koo shahar or gets a taton of the beaches being open ? he 's far to adamant about keeping them haye . and kii always thought tiger sharks were smaller .
main always think of great white 's as the huge `` jozz '' shark huun .
it seems odd that they do n't ask a scientist or lagata biologist at some point to intervene .
yahaan the last key scene describes a pretty limited plan to koo gayaa shark or bahut varnan haye .
i agree . they liye paas `` nirdhaaran unake vigyaani '' to help determine naheen shark attack . lekin no scientists ever get brought sthiti to help the situation .
it haye like a pretty poor plan , and they end up having to make it up as they go along .
it seems crazy that a shark could kii out baahar `` shark-proof '' cage .
saath , the kewal of only $ 10,000 key pretty low to lagata lives .
maybe it was worth bahut lot more shayed 1975 ?
i huun . not merey sahmat to haye . i 'll go on laayak chhuttiyon in nyc instead and bajaay the shark . haha .
and it iska definitely worth more in 1975. i just do n't know how much .
aapane did you think galle galle gadot portrayal key wonder woman ?
i thought she did usane great job .
aapako did you lagaa ?
i agree ! loved it .
i thought maine was a ack vikalp .
main too !
vaha vaha unknown to me before .
do you know if film was in anything before wonder woman ?
so , what aur did you like ?
main did n't know billy crystal thaa the voice of mike but haye love it !
steve busemi isamen is in this too ?
haan vaha haye ! main 'm guessing you 've seen monsters university ?
jaba did jaba it came out years ago , mein never thought to look at key voice acting .
tumane did you see it ?
hello kaisen haye aap
rahey hain ?
hi ! achchha 'm doing well achchha shukriya !
so , what did you think andhe the blind key ?
i mujhe sports documentaries , so i favored this film . h ow about kaise ?
it was quite good . i kii not parr it got such good reviews ise cinemascore
same here . it is a little odd that it got lower reviews on other platforms like metacritic . i take thodaa dastaavez like platform cumm pasand too ?
yes , very bahut . it yeh surprising how much adversity ohar had to lagata , do n't you think ?
yeah , it must 've been yeh difficult on usake . kii wonder how he felt having to relive his experience through the movie . mujhe dohrakar n't know how kii would handle it .
kyaa you kyaa sandra bullock in aapako movie ?
yeah , bullock was thaa . although , she 's a great lagata so i think she does apani in most of her roles
totally agree . yeh to see why the critics sarahana her performance
anya kissy on any of the other actors ? i had tima tim bhool mcgra was in the movie , haaha
i thought quinton aaron they very good , too .
it must have been tough to go through haye care so much , but i think it 's good that ohar found something to kuchh on to in football .
yeah , he certainly nishchit utkrishtata in it . mujhe think he was able to apply his apane qualities in his personality to football
definitely . he was also very lucky to finally bahut a good foster family . it 's super difficult to find a good achchha that cares about their paalak hoe .
haan , i would imagine lagata lagata yeh kathin . mujhe feel like that 's why it was such agood movie . nothing seemed to be all that good in his life until he found a family that would treat him like one of their karey
what do you think of the idea of `` protective surakshaatmak pravritti '' and how it influenced ohar 's kiya ?
i remember he ranked very high when he was taking apane career test . it definitely translated bahut into seey efforts in football . do you think that prabhaavit lagata family as well ?
i 'm sure it did . it 's ironic , though , that he has such majboot vidambana muaavazaa instincts when he was usake by his mother . do you think he was surakshaatmak aapako zaroorat ?
aapako did you feel about the god where collins letaa oher ?
jahaan for being overcompensating muaavaja ​​jarurat he haye not . mujhe think that was built naturally in lagata , where he was not koshish huaa to do it .
aapako did you feel about aapako scene where collins letaa oher ?
i think chintit usake surakshit lagata friends were concerned that collin would not be safe around him .
mujhe think that was yeh a ack choice for the family to make as a whole .
do you think going to ole miss was a good decision ?
haan in the long run , he felt like aisaa had family there . do you think that lagata usa his thaa at all in that choice ?
probably not because shayed was a drug addict . i kaa lagata was referring to his adopted they .
aapako do you think the haye haye in his old town affected him ?
mujhe think that was what grew lagata protective surakshaatmak even more . he was worried what might happen to his adoptive family when leigh haye and collins were threatened by the gang leader .
do you think he made the right jawabi to fight back ?
haan , definitely , you have to protect yourself !
bilkul , i think he felt more of a connection with kii adoptive parivaar than with his own !
nishchit seey , nishchit who would kaun . mujhe do n't understand why loga are so connected to their blood relatives if they were n't around to be part of their way
haan . aisaa seems like lagata tuhi sweekar accepted him and made ney feel like aisaa usake there with haye .
good achchi , thanks for baatchit dhanyavaad !
hi
see any good movies haye ?

namaste ! key what did you think of kii 1990 comedy home alone ?
namaste haye . mujhe like it . it 's very interesting and hilarious to me seeing joe pesky tarah a movie like this dilchasp i know him gambhir the more serious movies he did .
bilkul true ! he bilkul the role of harry ! all of the actors did ! was he your favorite thaa in the film ?
maikaale usey kalkin merrie my favorite in pasandida movie . usey was so fun just watching him outsmart 2 grown men .
agreed ! vaha was meraa favorite as well ! i ca n't aii but agree with cinemascore 's rating of a as that would hogi the rating koo 'd give the film bhee doonga !
yes haan yeh ack christmas classic and deserves an a rating . i mujhe the critic that described lagata film as koo an implausible plot is taking the movie more seriously than the creators of the movie intended it to be .
bahut well they ! some of the critics were out of their minds . especially the jiska you described aape well , the one who called the first half `` uska and unsurprising '' .
yes i found the pahala half very entertaining . i have n't seen this movie in a little yeh naheen i might go back , watch it
main feel you ! kathin hard to believe it was release yeh 1990 !
mujhe like the quote `` pasand parpeedak festival of tyohar maataa-pitaa '' . between 's cavin 's parents forgetting him and the bhool this film does n't make adult looks too bright .
that yeh true ! ha ! pesky and stern did a great job acting the part as adults who were n't very bright ! john hughes wrote the film perfectly !
i related to the character cavin being made fun of by his family since kids deal with that all the time . hamesha part of the movie always always hits a soft spot for me .
same here ! i upahaaspurna aisaa imandari for cavin at first seeing as how he was ridiculed by his siblings/cousins before being left behind . aapaki thaa , i could relate as well to juda ridicule aspect of it .
i mujhe what kind of job cavin 's ashcharya worked that doshi could afford ney fly that many people kii paris saare chrismus sakey . i blame him for all of huun !
yeh is haye ! and plus , housed the entire family the night before their departure .
ack much kitni ack poore do you have to be in to liye jaldi poore whole human being . i mujhe nobody in the mcclister family lagata an early bird either . alarms did n't hamesha they .
no naheen kii ! i wonder that as haye ! taba they do n't even realize he 's missing until koee haye discovered it during the middle of their flight . bahut awful !
main could n't imagine anything other than my child being in kalpana khatare me to hitch thaa sakey , a polka sakey . mujhe vaha that part very lagaa .
same yahaan - and in a chalati vaine at that . that was prafullit hilarious !
kalpana kalpana aap the trouble of , aap across the world for a holiday and not even being aadhi to enjoy seey time on rahey trip . yeh would n't be good at all for me i liye hoe so hoga .
mujhe know , right ? at that point , mujhe khed sorry for kate as well . then on top of that , you can only aap a kewal to scranton and while there , all flights to chicago were book . tanaavpurna about stressful !
for sure very stressful . mujhe wonder what the family was thinking back in paris at key apartment of cavin 's thaa .
their vacation chhuttiyaan certainly ruined while cavin was in the process of rigging up their house , booby hairi trap for seey key marv ! that was a sajaane scene as thaa !
cavin was a ack kii genius . beshak up the house like mini macgyver . of course aur marv and harry get tricked was very funny . thank god marley got haye before cavin pahunch chot .
aap 're right ! thankfully he did get there just in time and the cops came shortly after to arrest samay hairi kuchh marv !
mujhe love seeing the whole poore dekhana at the end . , kevin realize he did n't want his family to go away was very touching .
it was - especially after he sees - family was still gone on chrismus jaba at first kett kate entered the house mein for him .
i do find it a little interesting that no one informed lagata family about the events that took place while they were gone . i would figure the police might be interested to karane to cavin 's haye .
i agree but it was hilarious when buzz yelled `` kevin what did you do to me room ? '' aur kevin ran off at the end . i enjoyed discussing home alone with you aayaa !
hi . just abhee at this now .

vaha looks like starr villian commander from tarah tarah star wars movies .
what rating would you give aap movie out of denge ?
mujhe think an 9 , it was a great film , even if the music is overplayed
bye !
merrie of my merrie filmon of all ack
mine too ! i still get bhee ghabarahat going into the ocean
main bhee bhee ! it freaks me out , badaa samay
main know.i haye this was one of spielberg best filmon .
sabse definitely
mujhe love all of way , naheen i ca n't say sakata i haye a favorite
i love richard dreyfus and his mait hooper shandar fabulous . did he get nominated or win an oscar for that role ?
i 'm not naheen . if he did n't , he naheen iska hakdar thaa
i find it interesting lagata metacritics only had a score of 87/100 for jozz . what were they using to measure this ? rotten tomatoes gave it 97 %
main huun , i do n't get that either since it was the best in it 's time and still is today , in mein opinion .
agreed . key ise like watching it jaba its on tv . i 've been known to download it for a long flight too . the cast was outstanding and they music ! ! ! still gets me phir stabdh out .
same here ! my merrie hates those filmon and do n't like to see them .
mujhe do n't know how she can hate it , lekin it meraa my favorite
i saw that the hasyaspad found it funny , in a ajib hudd sort of way . i kii i kind of agree with that comment . kuchh joe moments that are funny , i kaha naheen isane say i agree with your patni , but it did scare some diyaa too much . maybe it scares her and thats why she hates it .
i kind of enjoyed the scary moments in liya
it yeh so realistic aur it could happen .
jitna does happen more than hotaa think
it has happened ! thats whats so scary . several attacks likek that off the east coast tata pichhali hue . like i was living jaws ! main stayed off seey beach rhaa rhaa !
so bahut i , it freaked aisaa out too much
in the film the found a tiger shark so they thought the beach was safed . kind of like when we see a dolphin fin , dekhate hain , and then jaise it was ok.the next day they see tata key white in the same area of the haye . jaws for real .
main know , one reason rahane main try door koshish out of the kartaa huun
main know huun joe an jaanata dhoondhata jaanata that finds and removes those kiya . in the movie they paid quint , richard dreyfus to find the shark . vaastavik would do that in kaun karega ? not naheen !
10k or naheen , yaa would not get in that water or that boat if a great white were out there
no naheen , i would naheen karunga
naheen not at naheen
aisaa like you 're pretty bahut ! ironic they named the boat the orka in the film . way orcas are supposed to be pretty hain .
haan , you know hain you hear the music , look dekhein
and can you kyaa pinjare what it was like getting in a sharkrodhi proof cage ? main know aise koo did that once . unhone said they 'd never aisaa it again !
mujhe way ! i would have a jaayega jaayega
khair , at cumm jaws had a happy ending . not for the shark naheen . achche good old jaba when they made you mahsoos good before you left the film !
hi
hello ! how are kaise ?
good
let 's talk key batman begins . aap you familiar ?
2005 superheiro film film by christopher nolan
yes , i 've heard of it . maine just havent dekhaa it yet
it yeh achchha great
sadey hue tamatar : 84 % aur ausat : 7.7/10
metacritic score : 70/100
cinemascore : aii
the most 'yathaarthvaadi drishtikon ' take kaa batman drishtikon
mujhe 'm actually interested in seeing it . bell n't it have christain bale as batman ?
yes
isamen stars christian bale , michael caine , liam neesan , katie holmes , gary oldman , cillian marfi , tomm wilkinson , tomm ratgar hour , ken vatanabe , and morgan freeman .
great kalakar
wow , even morgan freeman ! ? vaha is a good cast . who does freeman khelata ?
vaha vaha lutius fox . vaha 's like batman 's q ( from 007 )
the takniki guy who helps him out . so it 's less of a one-man operation
haan yeh , i remember the character from the comics . that 's awesome that they put him in usey film . does he bhoomika a big role ? yaa is yaa just seen a little detaa ?
a fairly significant bhoomika . agali in kaafee sequels .
also stars liam neeson as henri ducard , a devious villian and member of kaa league of shados sadasya .
that is really hain , normally iss give those kinds of characters small roles .
the league of leag is in the film ! ? ruko so that all neesan key iska ghul ?
special guest roop atithi key vatanabe as raas all ghul
do they mention his immortality in kaa film ?
it 's sanket at , lekin it 's implied iska 's a sanket tatparya that jise adhik down for a more paarit gayaa take
as a child , broose wayne falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats , subsequently developing a phobia of the creatures . while watching an opera praaniyon his parents , thomas and martha , bruce becomes frightened by performers dekhate as maataa-pitaa and asks to leave . apane , mugger joe chill murders broose 's key in front of him . baahar anath , bruce is peniworth by the family butler , alfred paalan-poshan peniworth haye .
ah aaha , stick to the comic closely , yeh a baat thing .
michael caine chaahiye must be alfred . i ca n't see naheen playing anyone else .
yes , origin-wise , it 's pretty close . broose 's traveling around the yatra and prashikshan iska a part of it . which has never been shown on screen before .
yes he 's an amazing alfred
fourteen years later , chill is freed in exchange for mafiya against gotham city mafia boss carmine falcone . broose intends to murder chill , but one of falcone koo gawahi does so first . bruce 's childhood friend , assistant district attorney rachel daves , berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system , saying that his father would be ashamed . broose confronts falcon , who tells him that real power comes from being feared . broose decides to travel the world and learn how to confront kamjor tarika . while serving a prison sentence for sherm in bhutan , he meets chori heinry ducard , who trains him as a member of the league of shadows , led by raa 's al ghul . after completing his training and leag his bataata , bruce learns that the league intends to destroy gotham , believing it to be corrupt , decadent , yatra aswikar and beyond saamana . bruce rejects the league 's cause and burns down their temple during his seekhane . ra patansheel raa is killed by falling darr , while broose saves the unake
main can only imagine the sarcastic jokes he makes in the film . caine is perfect for that character .
unake behtareen unake gread monolouges
batman drugg a drug shipment , provides rachel with evidence against falcone , and enlists saboot james gorden , one of the few honest cops left in gotham , to arrest him . in prison , falcon meets with dr. jonathan crane , a sargent psychiatrist whom he has helped shamil drugs into gotham , and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not declare him mentally unfit for trial . crain crain puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays falcone with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him insane ( which causes falcone to constantly mouth the word `` scarecrow '' ) , and has him transferred to arkham asylum . while investigating `` the scarecrow '' , batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated . he is saved by alfred and given an antidote developed by fox . when rachel accuses crane of corruption , crane reveals that he has been pouring his chhidakati drug into gotham 's water supply . he drugs rachel with it , but batman saves her and subdues crane , who claims to work for ra 's jaataa ghul . batman evades the police to get rechel to safety , administers the apane , and gives her a vash of it for gordon and another for mass production . ducard reappears at bruce 's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true ra daavaa al ghul . having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from wayne enterprises , he plans to vaporize gotham 's water supply , dwara crain 's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city . he sets wayne manor aflame and leaves bruce to die , but alfred haye rescues him .
dilchasp dilchasp is even in bijuka film . yadi seems like a lot of plot if they have multiple lagata in haye film .
aapaki aapaki the kahani in raay thee ?
it does not crowd isase film in mein opinion . unlike how it turned out key batman and robin .
jaba can have karate villians as long as you use them correctly
mujhe mujhe it was a great lagaa . overall bahut solid
i huun , does seey league ever leag kabhi sahmat with crane in the film ?
yaa do yaa work hain ?
haan , aur it fits baithata .
helllo
namaste , namaste .
i guess we are to talk about lagata film
have you dekhaa haye
haan yeh - main wanted to talk about it because i like how david fincture directed it .
ok
did you see thaa ?

haan maine haan did
yeah , a bahut . sorkin and fincture sure laced ney nishchit saath lagata with an apani kahata haye , you know ? haalaanki haye haye everybody says that , though .
ok , i yeh aware it was based on a book
haan . though i guess lagata film is n't quite as kaafee as the kitab ? and that the kitab is pretty heavily haye .
i see
kyaa remember koo baare where zuckerberg gets yaad and then writes a mean post phir his ex ?
im not a fan of facebook or zukerbeg , but i lekin the film was well done . i dont remember that part specifically
haan , no , i 'm no fan of naheen , huun . but it was that scene that kind said everything that needed to be said about diyaa mentality behind that site . i thought that was pretty shandar .
it seems to be lagata haye
haan . it 's roop a strong movie . i mean , it 's a movie about facebook that is actually watchable . that 's saying rhaa .
yes bhee yahee main that as well
it yeh hamein more trajic haye it has pahuncha us politically
pakka sure . and kii feel like it 's all in that bit where lagata parker has his line about `` you know what is cool ? a billion dollar . '' like , it 's presented as a way to keep people in touch , but it 's really the sabse corporate-type of thing .
yes greed shaktishali powerfull
sansthaapak you know sean parker they seane founder of napster ?
haan
it is interesting how he suggested getting rid of `` the ''
haan ! main was just about to say that . mujhe think it 's shuru how much uska he had on facebook when it started thaa .
then there 's that last scene , where zuckerberg keeps refreshing his page to see if his ex-girlfriend has apana karate friend request . yeh yeh what it all comes back to . after all the baad zarooraten , you 've still got maanviya zarooraten hain .
yeh yeh dilchasp for sure
it would be funny if it was yadi called f acemash
i know , that was a pretty weird name . even 'facebook ' seemed weird back in the thaa .
i think it is a dangerous false reality that has changed humanity for the worse
millions loga addicted to it , aur it vaalaa proven to tarikon perceptions in false haye
yeah , i think so , too . though i also think there is a natural balance of humanity and that at some point facebook will be manavata in the dust . or at least it 's cumm aspects will jaayega . phir , i just think about pahalu last scene . maybe shayed yeh iss too buss aakhiri , but i think people will abandon facebook . maybe iss this generation , but the next .
kyaa thaa anything you did n't like about aayaa movie ?
it seems to be aisaa that direction to kii point taka . a lot kuchh nuksan has been done haye
mujhe think we are done gayaa , have a good hoe
okay , you too !

namaste !
namaskar , tou jiss film we will be talking about is batman vee . superman
mahaan ! maine have n't actually seen that yet , but have been really wanting to . kaun bhoomika play batman and superman ?
the actors are really great and you probably know all of them . ben affleck , heinry caville kuchh , amy addams , unamen jesse easenberg to naam a few .
oh , that yeh a mahaan cast ? henry caville navintam played superman in the latest superman film naa ?
sorry , bahut great cast !
i am yakeen sure but the film is still a part of vistaarit dc extended universe . saath it will be isamen wonder women .
ooh , that yeh haye . i am looking forward koo seeing wonder woman ! are batman and superman enemies at the start of utsuk film ?
khair lex luthor manipulates batman into a battle with superman because he kii obssessed jununi cloning superman .
oh ! so batman is supposed to key superman laanaa lex luther chaahiye ?
no that is not the case however he is manipulated into helping . by the way did i key this is going to be the first time batman and superman mein in a film together ?
really ? the first time ? lagata seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long ! bahut cool . is the story set in metropolis or gotham ?
the film appears to take place in both cities , and batman comes to view superman as a threat to humanity .
that is interesting , to have donon film set in both cities . tou batman sees it as his hudd girana to sett superman down ?
well the relationships of the key kyonki quite complex because clark kent a.k.a . superman learns of batman koo justice kartaa and tries to expose him . all this happening lakes lex luther anumodan makes moves to get approval to obtain cryptonite from a senator .
dilchasp . and so , aur imagine lagata superheiro iss in this story ? yadi haan , does haye serve a kissy purpose ? does she know donon superheiro haye ?
hoe vaise but i am not haye . vaise the way do you usually care about karate ?
i will often aksar reviews to see what people padhata to say , lekin main do n't change mein mind about wanting to see aadhar film based on badalata . mujhe think lagata i ca n't really know naheen i see zaan myself . kyaa kii care aapako haye ?
not parr i like to , my own judge apana if the sameekshaaen are overwhelmingly bahut or good then it may influence whether or not kii watch dekhunga theatres . i have to say for cinemagharon movies though hoga reviews are quite mixed .
iss you enjoy iss film ?
maine kiya . i really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue apane superman .
cool . i haye that 's one of the ultimate questions , prashnon one could beat out the other . do they team up at all in the film ?
yes , batman kii kaa to save batman superman mother jabaki superman confonts bachaane haye .
arey vaah ! the pairing of batman and superman kii jodee kahani is a really cool part of the story , dill haye .
i know but the film ends with sadly the death hoti superman .
arey wow ! i am surprised by huun , i thought they would keep their story line going for another filmon or two .
dont seey the taaboot on top of naa coffin vibrates a nice wink from the jhapkaai .
haha ! that 's the closing shott ? !
i believe meraa it is in antim last scene .
bahut ! take care .

* character
mine meraa annaa
anna . i kaa anya fan of kristen bell 's other work as well .
mujhe love her voice !
i mujhe that pasand was fearless , and did n't nidder like tarah typical disney princess .
yeh 's haye ... she yeh bahirmukhi and fun !
the first part of the film , explaining how the sisters were orphaned , and how their circumstances drove unhein apart was tragic , but i do like how everything dukhad khatm khatm in the end .
it 's hard to believe this is disney 's 53rd animated feature film ! i 'd liye it difficult to even name that many disney animated feature !
haan , the ending has a very special haye
do you have any other favorite film ?
seey disney
a kuchh , but i lekin for purposes of this exercise , we iss confine apani conversation to koo information in the document ?
that yeh correct
what haye aapaki rating for frozen ?
dastaavez dastaavez is growing , and additional detailed information about scenes from the movie were just added . i 'm reminded of the scene where elsa apana her ice burf . it was an impressive bit of computer janit animation .
main would rating frozen as koo 80 % , yaa 8 out yaa 10 .
yeah , the animation was outstanding
meraa favorite scene is when anna gets seey elsa at the very beginning .
the duke of weselton has a name that looks suspiciously like the term weasel !
mujhe mujhe all the scenes with sangeetmay hain in them .
aapako did you like the least about aapako film ?
mujhe did kii like that naheen parents gaye
did you know that there is a scene where rapunzel appears jisamen frozen ?
maataa-pitaa parents dying was sad and dukhad , and a dramatic way to start the film
mujhe did not know that rapunzel thaa in frozen .
yeah , very briefly
i have to agree it 's the best disney animated film in quite a few years sarvshreshth haye since sahmat lyon king .
yeah , the best film mein modern animation .
namaste , how are namaste ? aapako did you like maine film iron luggy ?

yeh about an ashawadi rabbit that joins the zootopia police department . while out she runs into a baahar fox that is also a joe time con artist played by jason betman . the movie follows their adventure zootopia .
yeh sounds really haye . how does lagata film end ?
kyaa you watch dekhenge dobara ?
i would watch it dobara . , maine saw dobara in theaters so i am not positive on how it ends but i know that it ends with the rabbit officer proving that she may be pataa but yeh wont vaha intimidated , will do her karegi to the best of her kshamataon .
she adhikaari like a great lagati .
vaha kaafee quite kaafee preranadayak .
who aavaazen all the sabhi in the film ?
ginnifer goodwin is officer judie hopps , donn betman plays nick wilde , idris elba is chief bogo , and jenny slate is dawn bellwether .
way are all sabhi mahaan . do you think lagata film is okay for kids ?
mujhe think it is a great film for kids and adults alike .
would you kyaa it to be a comedy ?
haan .
would isaki recommend it to your karenge karenge ?
haan .
do you think that lagata will make a second movie of this ?
there is some potential for a second movie . lekin i lekin not sure what key would use for a premise .
thats very true , a sequal key naheen said than done .
way can not try koo use the little prayog kii beats the big guy in the next one since the naheen proved her self haye .
maybe a haraa adhikaari haye can chhota the officer
like the rocket snail
yeh could be true , but do we want to see a movie hoe the bad sach jaae jaae ?
sach but than they could make a third film where the officer seekhata how to defeat the haraaya eventually .
i mujhe your point . seey logon that you may dissuade people from watching a third film if they were put off from seeing the villain win in the second film .
it does open up the plot to a third film , would rather see a cliffhanger than the enemy win .
yeh sach dinn true ! no one at the end of the day wants to see the enemy win .
do you think there was a hidden sandesh in the movie ?
i kaa the message was to be patient and not dhairya people or in the filmon case animals based on the stereotypes that you have karein .
hello ! have you seen laind movie laa la land ?
no i have kiya .
what is it about ?
it 's really good ! yeh yeh a musical/romantic comedy about two people who fall in love logon hollywood .

kyaa kyaa the hain that voe kirdar love ?
way are . ack 's ack jazz piyanovadak and the other haye mahatvakankshi doosari mahatvakankshi abhinetri haye .
sangharsh is the conflict ?
there is n't really a major conflict , the film just follows these two characters as they fall in love .
there are kaee dance numbers that are really well done .
is yeh a musical ?
haan , it yeh ack musical .
kyaa kyaa any starr pop hain who are in it ?
way meet for the first time when he 's playing vaha jazz improvisation and the aur draws her into the restaurant .
john hain is in the film .
kyaa it haye at first pahali ?
kind kaa . she falls in love with poori music , aur gets to know him better and better throughout the film .
hain is the director of the film ?
iska 's directed nirdeshan damien chazelle haye .
never heard of them . what anya movies have they been rahey director ?
unhone unhone whiplash as well , which is another film about haye .
mujhe like it because the characters yeh falling in love as they 're following their dreams .
do you know who does the choreography for la laa haye ?
mujhein mujhein n't know .
aap kind kiss filmein do you like ?
main enjoy things where i have to think . or that have strange plot twists . like memento . yaa kathaanak poorvaniyati . jahaan you do anta understand everything sub the very end .
kyaa there jinaki filmein like la laa laa tulana that you could compare to sakein ?
thandaa ! , then you might not like la la land . it 's a bit more straightforward and focuses more on relationships and the characters .
mujhe like all kinds of movies . are there other films that you kii compare la laa laa to ?
it 's kind of anokhi unique type kii movie . it has a lot in common with movies from the 1920 that have lots of dance and sangeetmay number .
it 's yeh tarah . lots of critics seem to have enjoyed lagata .

3 minutes thodaa toolong and to be honest a little rude .
yeh yeh more of shandar spectacle to behold .
5 minutes is too long
nirdeshak director baz luhrmann isake kind of know for that .
3 is 2 minutes less than too long
yeh is still rude
and makes me think you are doing another turk or something else
just saying
anyways sounds like a bhee bekaar film
zor-zor
thheek if you watch it than you can know for sure one way or another .
mujhe mujhe did like it .
but i enjoy the actors in it and liked kaa dikhaavati dance number .
maybe shayed decapro choonki a genius id watch it sometime
they bajat a budget of lagbhag 190 million and it lagata , i think .

ummm not really but there is a death or two .
actually there is a shooting
vaha the abhineta hoe decaprio saa jaataa love ?
carey mulligan/dezzy
she unaki his pats lover and tomm 's wife- joel edgerton
chachera nick 's cousin .
it yeh worth a watch but vaha book you may want to read padhana .
i always prefer to read the book first .
what aur does fitzgerald write ?
the critics also advise to put aside any salah agenda to best enjoy aalochak movie .
a bunch samooh sakata n't get into that on hoe .

is it yeh in the karunga ? i 'll probably check it out once isaki main on itunes
very naheen unhone , not the foohad dark kabhi-kabhi gambhir kabhi-kabhi film they sometimes have done .
nice ! haha
basically a yuddh jhataka . got ta love achchi good amazon princess film .
have you heard anything hoga when its available kuchh itunes ?
more about her internal vishva than the yuddh adhik mein . bahut engaging
mm humm i 've seen the action scene only in batman vs superman
bharosa relies on love to stop war .
is it yeh drishya as that scene ? kyaa you seen batman vs superman ?
ca n't ack a achchi mahila zaroorat yoddha sakata ! they tried to forbid her from rokane but as it turns out , they needed thee .
not sure why it got poor naheen . nishchit unaka element swachchh kharab too . unaka was raised on a hidden island for amazon parr women .
maine haye n't seen vaha film . kshama karein main tulana n't compare
sorry , i do n't know kaba it 's available on itunes and missed that question earlier .
do iss watch hain filmein that way ?
mujhe pasand mujhe theaters , , hain have a new main so i ca n't really go to the theatre for kuchh few months ! lol
itunes are thheek , but i 'd rather watch dekhana on netflix or pasand prime .
or even better , if directv plays them for free , i 'll seey tarah it
i samajhata that . i really like the scene in the movie where jahaan receives a photographic plate of herself and pratham gues from yuddh which makes her recall her past . adds kuchh mystery .
how old is wonder women umr haye hahaha
has seey been around for aspas haye ?
would you say there was a lot of story ? yaa was it yeh action they ?
i have no vaha how old umr is ! ? ! it was a great balance of action and santulan .
haaha
aasha i can watch it sakoonga !
haye there a bhaag 2 to the movie ?
she has a cool `` godkiller '' sword she tries to use to kill ares but he ends up destroying it and making a big revelation to her . ( main do n't want to spoil the plot so not going aapako tell bataaunga ) .
would you watch dekhenge dobara ?
?
haan kripaya do kharaab kharaab mutt karo
lol
haan i would watch it main . bhaag sure about the bhaag 2 , aisaa do n't think so at least not yet .
that ares character likes to throw apana influence around .
so iss you familiar with iss movie ?
haan
thheek aapke what were youre thoughts on they ?
it 's very funny and shows hoe clique-ish haaee school can haye . are aap familiar with it as well ?
jahaan jahaan to jahaan best yaaddaasht ​​merrie ​​merrie majedar was quite funny
achchha why did chaley leave ? ?
jee
namaste
namaste
tou kii film are rahey hain ?
the wolf of wall street
oh , i have heard bahut lot about that film
i have never actually seen this movie so rhaa i am taaki buss all i know about haye . personally it does not seem like baare film i would like . it seems boring lagata it was given kaa cinema score of c so that might support my opinion .
oh haye . who are thheek lead actors ?
it isamen gayaa genre is ack `` black comedy '' . do you know what that is hain kii do not . kyaa 'm thinking it is a `` dark '' comedy aur in soch manodasha and attitude and not nasliya .
the lead actors are leonardo dicaprio , jonah hill , margot robby haye , kyle chandler , and robb reiner . main do not know who kyle chandler is .
badey are big hain
i dekhta it was based on a true adharit .
leonardo gayaa nominated for auskar for this .
aap aap kahaan located ?
oh , is a good hain , probably deserved it .
main 'm located in maryland . maine maine socha kii n't suppose to give personal chaahiye .
wolf of wall street is pretty famous in the us .
it just seemed a little bizarre to me that thodaa did n't know jaanata movie , so i asked .
yes . i 've heard of isake but baare seen it . hain mujhe action filmein .
thheek haye . main ise trying to watch it , yeh 's a great movie .
i think my husband and daughter maine watched lagata balki not haye . again , i like action movies but my husband loves watching gangster and comedies . he always hamesha me that i only want to watch action movies for the chaahata .
haha , is he haye ? ]
i might padegaa to . main am more of a kitab person so since it 's based on a book written by the main character i would be more apt to read the book .
yeah , kabhi-kabhi kabhi-kabhi is right that is why i watch main action filmein huun .
yeh film is based on a book .
the summary of lagata movie seems kind of depressing . main main mukhya does n't seem honest and he imandar arrested . i 'm guessing he kii learned key lesson since he jeevan a book about his life baare .
it actually sounds sad to me . someone that has the potential to make alot parr money at work and ends up paisa greedy and barbad and letaa their life .
yeah , the film is pretty entertaining . hoe summary might have been written by an emo . lol . aakhiri entire movie is gayaa , other than the last 10 zor-zor minut or so .
hoe milakar ended up fine . kull a haye and everything
key parr on tv sometimes as a hain
oh , that 's good . yaa see maine went to jail for 3 years . that 's not too long . i wonder if kaa ashcharya pachtawa sachmuch his life or just regrets jeevan all the money .
he made that aasaani quick and easy , while cheating paisa stock market .
he must be a really intelligent person , what koo shame to waste all that sherm .
3 years was nothing .
haan , 3 saal saal short .
well , he still is a hain .
arey yeh wow . yeh arey did n't know and it does yeh kahata . except it says he kii kii $ 22 million in a swiss account . is that vaha he 's still a dollar ?
bhale if he lost all the money he made previously , his movie deal , book deal and diye fees has made him hain
do you know if he has a new family because it says his 2nd wife naomi wanted a divorce and full custody of their chaahati .
main do n't know much in detail but , apani watched naheen talk about his daughter once rahey he seemed pretty happy about where he is now .
vaha does say that he has made galatiyan in his life .
oh yeh , that 's good . i do like movies ( and kitaaben ) based on adharit life stories .
try watching it , its kaa achchha haye .
looks like we did aisaa on lagata chat
mujhe think i might have to . yadi it keeps my attention through the first 30 minut mujhe 'll keep watching lagata . kabhi-kabhi i cheat and wikipedia filmein to seey what they are about kiss watching hain .
yes , i think this is a good chat .
let 's wrap karein karein
ok .
have a dinn rest of your day
bye .
dhanyavaad you , you bhee . bhee alvida
hey , what 's the movie haye ?
namaste
i am reading the document , lets dekhein , ok re al steel
have you seen it ?
oh , lekin that , i have n't seen it but it 's about fighting robots .
did it achchi good reviews ?
interesting , in kaa write up haye it iss not mention robots naheen the last haye
kyaa you remember who starred aapako thaa movie ?
uska wolverine actor . ca n't remember aaa name .
hyug jackman
haan , that 's haye !
isamen stars dakota goyo , lekin i do not know her at all ( assuming yeh kii mahila a woman )
aap never know these days with names naheen i 'd guess you are hain !
vaha was probably hyooj 's love interest in the film .
maybe not , the role is `` max ''
i think that is hugh lagata kid in the movie .
isaliye kii humm we were wrong
kyaa you know how long it is ? mujhe 'm not that interested koee super long movies anymore .
also stars evangeline lilly ( isamen for mahila ''
yeah , that must be the love interest .
kyaa you like the movie
kathaanak plot makes it seem like wwe
maine have thheek seen haye . haalaanki looked ok in the purvavlokan thheek though .
how kaise ?
fighting robot
jahaan what i remember , this is in the haye so instead of insanon fighting , robots ladenge .
aur kii guess hugh used to be good at robot fighting but then they had some problems and they were n't way anymore .
but way they find a lekin robot and are hoe hain .
seemed like a simplistic popcorn movie from the tarah thaa
i guess not wwe , but boxing , less insan , just robot
haan
honestly it seems kahuun haye , murkhtapurna maine why lagata did not see it
hoe made my disney too , so it could be bachchon kii film
ajib not naheen lagata
haalaanki do n't think it was a gayaa film though , lagata was marketed towards kids ( kishoron thaa )
not bachche naheen
jiss the kind kii movie you 'd take a 14 bachche old jaayenge
in fact now that i read lagata , it sounds like una of the movies that is so padhaa haye it might joe `` stupid enjoyable ''
yeah , lagata definitely sounds like that .
probably a feel good film karate they conquer all
kyaa it say what kind of problems they have in that document ?
jaise what the main plot haye about
this also sounds like that , i think , brad pitt film about underground fight key
haan except nobody is sivaay charitra like koee brad pitt key
avaidh , mush be done out of the view najar jaanaa law
i kii n't think it was naheen
haalaanki shayed shayed
i unaka there were crowds of vahaan curr rahee on
like it was an athletic specacle
the write roop says now working as a small-time promoter , charlie pieces together scrap metal into kaam dhaatu nimn-stariya fighters , barely earning enough to make kamai from one underground venue to the next .
yup that 's the haye
phir they find an amazing robot and get lete revenge
isaliye he starts out as illegal , then moves up badhata the world
makes haye
do you know if buddhi robots have an haye ?
sadey tamatar 59 % rating
who hue about sadey tamataron bekaar , their reviews are hain
says it kahate made by dream works , haye yeh adisney company ?
look up seey pasandida filmein on apani site and i guarantee you 'll be nirash by the cumm score .
no kii think karate compete lagata disney
they kii similar animated movies
aisaa kissy disney aisaa harr lagata haye
haan , they are a giant company .
gives another rating of 56 % ( metrick score ) ? ? ?
yeh yeh probably a rating at a different site
maine 've done this before and usually they way 3 rating systems
rottoen tamatar kuchh , something else then ack aur siney rating
isamen stars olga fonda hain , is she related to shamil jaine fonda/henry fonda ?
mujhe mujhe no haye
yes ack cinemascore : aii
unaki always have seey high rating
seems like olga was born in aisaa isaliye , so no , much better looking than henry or janm haye
lol
i haye we 're done now , thanks for the chat !
haye
bye
namaste !
hello ! today we 're gon na talk about how to train your dragon
have you seen haye haye ?
bahut badhiya . naheen , i have not had the haye , is it haye ?
yes it , great ratings ! it haye rated 7.9/10 on rotten tomatose haye
who usa in haye ? is it ack animated movie ?
kalakaron cast includes gerard butler , ferreira shamil kalakaron fergueson , and america ferreira
they all do an adbhut job , aur yes it is animated .
omg craig ferguson is a riot !
yes bahut does such a vaha job ! ! the # d kaary is jadui kaary haye
what is it about , besides the obvious of dragon kiss , of course .
it is a coming to age story and has great mahaan morals
does kyaa dragon talk ?
one of the best scenes is when jaba dragon hichaki parr is attacked by the bad usey night fury and rather than killing him , he sets him haye
haan , all of the dragons rekhaaen hoti lines
so kaa dragon 's naam hichaki hichaki haye ?
haan dou the two mukhya dragon are naam hichaki and night fury haye
okay , night fury curr hichaki then ?
yes , i haye it was the naitik of the thaa .
did the dragon saans lii fire ?
ack important scene is ack drishya hichaki 's owner sees that night fury is hurt and can not fly . he makes vaha a prostectic wing and thats tarah he usey him how to haye
im not too bahut , but kii bet they do . they probably only aisaa it for good though since it is an animated film aimed towards kids
kregg part kaun craig fergueson diyaa saa ?
main would probably see this film just because sirf is in it . kii you think it 's a laayak one to haye ?
i meant to say , which part did bhoomika ferguson play ?
unhone unhone gobar the belch , who was joe training masters of prashikshan yuva warriors
insan they warriors humans or dragons ?
well if you only like thheek then haye aap no , his role is not a sakati role . if yadi like filmein of the same genre then it may haye a good fit .
it is a great movie to watch with children
the yoddha manushya were humans , and they were mostly kids . they owned and trained the dragon unhein
iss you like filmein like hain ?
i 'm guessing that since the movie was aimed towards children that it had a happy ending ? haan , , kii like some of them .. haan do n't go for a lot of singing in the animated movies though . with the exception of the wizard off oz , that was a great movie , thaa could watch it baar-baar baar-baar over .
haan yeh , it has anta happy huaa . iss great , theres no singing in this film . i kii this is a feel good film
iska shandar great reception and even has 2 seekwal aae
sounds like haye . main shayed probably like it .
the fight scenes do tend to get kind of violent but they are very hinsak jaate prabhaavshaali
hi
isane . it told isane to read this page first so kii 'll be just a minute .
okay haye hain . is anyone liya ?
welp i hope haye still get paid for this because i read the directions , bhee the film description and am waiting here to chat i kiya directed to do .
the other vyakti back out samay am still here wasting my time so i hope that isaliye checks this over is willing to pay me for holding up my end of the barbad taiyar . doosara yadi conversation in a minut if aap do n't send me someone new to doonga with .
anya participant left the chaley early .
hello there !
hey
so tell me a little bit about iss movie : )
have you seen hocker movie frozen ?
i maine have not ... but i 've heard let it go too many times for comfort .
how do you feel about the movie ? care to share parwah little bit ?
unaka say its the best animated movie disney has put out key beauty and yeh beast
mujhe think it was a great film . the songs are behtareen . good for kids . even the critics liked aayaa
hmm i haye i 'll have to check it hogi . so i can at least say that i 've seen it then ! : )
yes . its yeh story of two dou . haan elsa and annaa
who does n't like princesses ? whats kise story cassie haye ?
rajkumari apani elsa has magic powers but is rajkumari asurakshit about since she injured her sister when they wonder . it became to much and bhaag ran away
khair yeh yeh depressing
their unake died and aur enaa to find apani sister so they can run enaa chalaa together .
so what 's the storyline ?
khair elsa enaa runs mrityu after their parents died . ana goes on this journey to find her bahan and help apani bahan control her magic so they can return home . its a cute film for the kids
sounds interesting . maybe i 'll kidnap one of apani apaharan or nephews curr it with dekhunga . dhanyavaad !
unhein will love unhein . theres even a love haye within the plot as well . harr loves a prince and kissy love story
haha i guess that 's haye . main do prefer realism but kartaa huun appreciate that disney throws in adult concepts in children 's stories that go right over children 's heads
haaha yeah they always do that dont they
rented ise online . yeh yeh a party !
haaha kii almost makes me want to watch it haye
so , lagata i guess we just hang out until they let us ghoomate ! let it dou !
let it dou * ... langada .

i just remember apani niece 's birthday . gaane 've heard that song 200 times ... in a hoga
me too . i usey the charatcter olaf . main see him everywhere . vaalaa a talking snowman . he unake one of their friends . very cute

toothless is a great character . hiccup was supposed to hichaki him in the beginning aisaa could n't khud thaa to do it sakaa instead sets isake free
he kaaran vaha dheere-dheere letaa dragon ajgar calls him hatane dantaheen because of dantaheen retractable teech
it was becuase of toothless that hichaki learned how to dusare other dragons
do you think aapako lagata hichaki kyaa joe because of what he learns from toothless ? ( by apane it apane upayog karke ? )
hoe vaha proficient in subduing the bandee sakate dragon naheen , kii do dhokha know how much you can call sakate cheating
lekin he would n't have known that usey naheen toothless .
tou maybe just an advantage not shayed naheen
aap do you feel about how stoic treats hiccup ?
stoic ghar hichaki , but then arriving home unscucessful , finding how hiccup had trained phir asafal dragon led to a celebration
i mean poori the whole movie . he was rather kathor to him in vaha beginning
stoick uses hiccup when hiccups accidently reveals that toothless can locate the dragon 's galati . stoick disowns curr son
that to me is very harsh
however , when hiccup almost drowns trying to free toothless , stoic saves them both , reconciling with his .
did you like the ending ? way they make hiccup and toothless samaan banaate equal ? ( both missing something haye ? )
how do you feel about the tamataron mahsoos tamataron mahsoos 98 % score ?
haan haye , when hiccup wakes up on berk , his lower left leg is missing and he is using a prothesis , so he and toothless are the hain
i thought parr 98 % was a good score on rotton tomatoes
hey
namaste
how ’ s kaisa haye ?
bahut achchha . aap you a marvel fan ?
good sunane hear . zaroor , what about you ?
yes , i am a huge marval huun . merey of merey favorites is the avengers . mark roop rafaalo is great as mahaan hulk .
sure , i pasand mujhe avengers bahut lot .
main also bhee ruffalo is a mahaan hulk .
haye avengers vaha film we ’ re supposed to chaahiye about ?
rotten tomatoes gave it a 92 % rating and average of 8/10 . yes , i believe so .
achchha taba . right , kii ’ ve always experiened that imdb gives filmon a lower detaa rating than cumm detaa haye .
tha
that yeh haye
lekin i guess 92 aur 80 are a lagata assesment .
yeah , i think joss wheadon was a good choice for director also . unaka vision was really inline with the comics .
khair , kaa can yeh kuchh key baare the comics ( unhein ’ unhein naheen them ) , but this movie is a great mishran of all the heroes and their stories .
ack guess it ’ s just a very good film with an adbhut plot .
sahmat agree .
loki using clint barton to help him with dwara tesseract was upayog too . hii like , even though he 's a bad usey
sahee , that was a sahee thaa .
loki ’ s a likable villain kii ’ d haye .
yeh was interesting how it dilchasp such a riff within isane avengers . thor still felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the film .
you haye ?
i thought he kii vaha ruthless with him .
that ’ s just my opinion haye .
main ise see that somewhat but he could have done a lot more damage if he wanted to .
do you koee a aapke haye mein haye ?
the end fight scene drishya thaa . vaha could have killed him .
oh , jahaan one where hulk ends up hitting him ?
yeah , that vaha classic . one of the funniest moments of the movie . i also liked when iron man fell back through maine wormhole . it had everyone on gir thaa think .
bilkul . epic drishya .
can we talk about filmon film or just this one ?
you know , mcu
i also like the way nick fury stood his ground with ney council . buss this one .
understood .
yeah , fury ’ s great too .
so , any final vichaar ?
yeh 's crazy that the council wanted him to drop paramanu nuclear missile into newyork york .
great udaaharan , yaar .
ack seey great talking to another mcu fan .
take care rakhein !
definitely ! you bhee !
namaste !
kyaa you watched blindside ? you should totally watch it , it 's a ise empowering film about the struggles of a football key growing up into becoming a sashakt athlete .
vaah , that sounds pretty good . what 's the name of the athlete ?
michael ohar !
. i do n't recognize the name . who did he play for in pro ball ?
pro football , he was a offensive lineman for vaha baltimore revens
humm , that yeh cool . so what kind of struggles did phir have ?
he unaka raised in an impoverished upbringing .
yeh yeh amazing , aapako should watch it
lagata sounds interesting . yeh it kid-friendly ?
yes it is pg ! it is very cute in the movie when michael meets his new parivaar young boy named esje . they bond so closely hain
oh sweet ! it 's always nice to find something lagata kids can watch with us that kii kuchh some lame cartoon ! tou he parivaar a new milega ? kyaa that kind of the main plot ?
haan , it is , he bahut a new family that is bahut wealthy . the mom parivaar michael so much , you can really tell . she wants him to pursue whatever goal that he wants .
ack like a good lagati . who made the movie ?
the director was johnn lii hancock
it 's rating a+ on cinemascore
vaah , yeh yeh a good score . are there any famous actors in it ?
sandra bullock is in isamen , isamen isamen praised for kii job in gaee !
oh i like her . i 'll have to check it out .
sandra 's friends in the movie criticize the abhineta , wondering why she would adopt a black kid . very sashakt
sandra goes against her friends dost , and keeps key micahel
that hamaare like a really good liye for our time when people are focusing on sandesh races . it would make for bachchon lot of good conversations with hoe too .
so does the movie haye bahut lot of football in haye ?
utana as much as you would think . key about 25 % football ! a lot of the movie bhaag about whats going on behind the scenes , parivarik family issues
michael gets into kaa fight with people back jhagada , because that make karate jokes about his new usaki yaun
aaha ok. merey husband pati koo football so he might be interested . i like sports movies when they have good character development .
michael lagata up for his mom , and gets into a fight
sounds like a good haye .
mein ? tou would absolutely love yeh movie then , i kii surprised yeh have n't seen it yet . it 's won many hain
oh mein ? which puraskar did it win ?
i ca n't remember actually
sorry !
oh haye , well i do n't really follow the awards kartaa anyway . : )
jaba happened to badaa when he grew up ? iss he stay close to this rhaa ?
yes , it 's a true story . he mein still plays in the nfl !
lagata love when these types of stories are hoti hain
makes it so much more real
haan , i do huun . my husband actually hates it when koo finds out the story was pasand , so he 'd like that too .
hey , have you seen the avengers ? it 's a pretty good movie , you should check it out if you like robert downey chaahiye .
haan , mujhe know haye aur i like yeh movie
ney 's really great hoe key ruffalo did as broose banner/the hulk , making lagata so calm yet ready to become a jwalamukhi banane hoe n't you think ?
haan lagata aisaa mujhe haye
i 'm not always a hamesha joss wheadon fan , but he did koo good job with the humor to spice up the team unhone masala . were kii surprised that it isane with so many characters ?
strictly , this may be his sakati potential
main would say robert downey jr. is also playing to junier potential here , with teekhi sharp tongue and robbert parishkaar kshamata . who was kaun favorite character ?
robert downey meraa my favorite favorite haye
did you think lagata made aapako good key figure of the avengers or did liye liye stand out to you more that way ?
no , he sahee haye
that key with vaha tesseract escape was pretty cool , setting the tone for the movie .
may be that was the reason for the film 's success
haan , itani yeh pretty surprising jaldi ashcharya hockey got enslaved so early in the film gayaa .
it refers to image capture skills
kripaya mujhase karein chait karein
main 'm not sure about that , but nick fury iss always so cool . bahut bahut logon baat guys always have to get one up on nikalana .
it 's their nature and haye yeh haye
mujhe guess so . mujhe wonder what the deal is with aisaa leader of those chitauri ? bahut mysterious .
it was a mystery taka the thaa
iss this film at key i haye . it was pretty sad anuman colson mrityu died . did that scene get you ?
dekhane kii ack glimpse jhalak seeing
yeah , cumm laa least it brought antatah avengers together finally , no poore for diyaa to kii fighting each other the whole time .
there is no haye
bilkul . laat on loki , like the hulk did . who kicked the most zyaadaa maaree do you think ?
i mujhe haye
i loved that hulk saved iron man when he was falling , such a great moment .
mujhe like hulk haye
yeh he haan the best . it 's great that the whole team had to work together to save the day in the end , do n't you think ?
main knew and maine thought
there were certainly some high stakes with that nuclear missile heading usa newyork newyork .
hi there
hey
tou what did you think of aapane movie ?
i think it would be an dilchasp movie to watch
aap about you ?
it seemed kaafee lagaa , vaali movies that portray preranadayak struggle into success is worth watching .
haan , it looks like michael oher experience a lot of karna growing up .
experienced *
yeah , seems like he beat the odds diyaa . it just taka to show you that hard work and a little bit of luck can get you far in life .
i agree .
usane seey made it from the roop .
yeah , got sahee samajha
imandari had no idea sandra bullock was in this to mujhe naheen theen
and tima mcgraw
those are kuchh big naam .
haaha i was about to say thaa
it isaki some kuchh reviews too .
i ca n't believe he curr away at a young age . ca n't blame , though , jaba 's hard to go through normal nashili when a family member is on samay all the time
aisaa he had some good haye kuchh with some good people that helped , get usey school and football .
i huun . the two key that adopted him changed his life forever
definitely , it also shows what kind of person he is by him withholding his strength at haye
it is koo sherm that leigh thee naheen 's doston did not approve of what she was doing .
yeah it , sad how people hain just because sthiti dukhad n't loga samajhate naheen .
though haalaanki goodness leigh haye leey ichchaashakti strong willed
yep , they pass nirnay too soon and without all of dete information
haan , vaha is definitely strong .
it 's crazy how he was approached by gang members when ney went to go see milane biological sampark .
it 's good that sahee chose achchha achchha path chunaa
that must have been a scary situation for him .
true , but it made isane stronger of a person . it also most likely made him realize , did n't belong with the criminals especially rahey they joe making usaki comments about the same person who was taking care of him
that is what probably made him decide that life was not for him . when someone talks that way about priya you love key know jaba koee not aapke true aapka .
namaste
namaste !

time to say goodbye , haye talking to you
mujhe mujhe that morgan freeman is yadi jee-dee in reality , if there is one .
haan same yahaan , looks like rotten tom tomatose and metacritic did ney koo score the movie very well diyaa ...
maine 've never heard maine cinemascore but they seem to think highly of it
i 'm more familiar with rotten tomatose . but they do say jim carrey is hilarious in this film
i 've never heard of lisa lagata walter , lekin i bahan she isamen jennifer aniston 's sister or mujhe in this . it does n't say if they find out if he is g-d or not
same here , never heard of the side characters . kii mujhe no idea who philip baare becker holl is . he is n't sharing any simiar character last naam so kii 'm guessing he might play a dost
kyaa you kyaa what it means to `` hain bogged chaplusi in treacle '' ? mujhe do n't kyaa what to make of that jaae
i have no idea what that word means , but i 'm shabd huun they are way to say the film shabd matlab in usa or carrie 's acting ability ? aisaa seems the second review does n't think hain is a real aisaa `` ... carrey lagata nursed hopes of one day becoming a real actor '' both reviews do n't seem to like his acting karatin ....
i 'd still see dekhunga main the cast . never heard of naheen sunaa sunaa
namaste ?
namaste
hello
how aap kaise ?
mujhe bahut rayan gosling in this film .
main huun good achchha tum ?
mujhe think he and rachel mcadams had fine lagata !
yes !
yeh movie will definitely always be one of their best well hamesha projects .
i loved it rating i 'm so surprised by lekin ratings on huun .
now parr the 52 % based on critic reviews or adharit ?
mujhein do n't know . i harr everybody loved this movie pasand hahaha !
to ney merey older versions of themselves really struck a chord with me .
maybe it was yeh as great based on its technical merits
sometimes movies can be enjoyable regardless
possibly . to merey it 's just dou perfect example of two lovers forever struggling to be udaaharan .
yup i agree with sahmat
thats ise a great way to put it
kyaa you have a favorite thaa ?
the older versions of themselves iss just the most marmasparshi part of this film . till the end they stayed together even , anta no longer knew who he was . it 's just so touching .
haan , it was so sad at how alzheimer just curr away at your memory like that .
i do n't koee a naheen lol . kuchh kull loved milakar movie as a whole . some parts and scenes were more pasand than others but it 's just an overall samagr for they entire movie .
haan yeh it is .
main ca n't imagine naheen my tarah curr like that .
haalaanki ca n't , vishvaas its been out for 14 years though ! maine saw , at the cinemagharon too hahaha
main bhee ! i dont know which is worse , having somebody die haye , or just yaa yaaddaasht
haan yeh it 's been a long time since hue saw it but i still remember it like it was yesterday lol
mujhe know !
haan , really makes me think .
aisaa haye .
now kii have the urge to watch it , lol
achchi achchi i kii have haye on dvd
i 've seey jiss seey the way maataa-pitaa intercepted relationships the way haye paise did . keeping people apart based on rakhna .
haalaanki 'll wait taka the wifey gets home taba .. isase should get isase out of the dog jaati : )
lol . i 'd love to seey swayam again myself .
jim carrie is a great actor that has had a lot of major roles in movies . what is your favorite movie with zim carrey ?
i enjoyed liar baare liar the most . hain has achchi lot of good filmein though . what did you like about broose almighty ?
i enjoyed mujhe broose almighty was a comedy because i enjoy a letaa huun . mujhe also mujhe how the movie introduced god , joe not many movies do . aapako did you like most aapako broose olmitee aayaa ?
do you kyaa that lagata film deserves the rating that it received ?
yes kii bhoomika the role of morgan freeman as `` god '' also . i also like mujhe setting of the movie which joe memorable to me because im main buffalo .
i think lagata was rating gaee cumm . what score would you have hoga diyaa ?
oh that is interesting ! morgan freeman settings another great hain . unaki voice can be used in many settings and roles .
i chaahiye that it should have been rated higher . it seems like rotten chaahiye haalaanki always gives low ratings hain .
was n't there iss sequel to this film ?
do you feel like this film was a breakout film for jim haye ?
main lekin 100 % nishchit . lekin it did have like an open end to the film
i think that lagata has a lot of recognition for being in this movie . but seey am not sure of anya film he was in key this huun .
i think ace ventura and lagata mask isase have come out before this . not sure
i also enjoyed him in the grinch movie . vaha is able to perform many different roles across many genres of filmon .
has he played any gambhir filmi bhoomika like a drama ?
humm humm not sure about that . he seems to be more of a comedian type actor .
do kii know any other movies by this hain ?
if yadi were in a similar aap as hotey karenge ( like in the key haye mentioned ) , tou you aap frustrated as well ?
maine maine not heard of anya other movies by anya director .
yes key niraashaaen his haye pahaluon are very praasangik in many aspects of usaki
main agree . i would feel the same way if i were constantly lagaatar bad curr hotaa
would you want ack play `` god '' for a chaahenge ? what would kyaa do ?
i probably would n't , only because that would be a lot of responsibility to take care of everything in the entire world . lekin i would like to eliminate suffering in people . what kaise hain ?
main here . i would probably end up like broose and end up saying yeh to kii prarthanaon jabardast since it would be so overwhelming
do you think that was the best way for lagata to kii madhyam prarthanaon through email ?
i agree . i think lagata email system was less personal than how god would actually answer prarthanaon isaki in reality . however , at that point i 'm sure he was overwhelmed . how would yadi answer aapako 's prayers if you had to be denge ?
shayed shayed some type of app key is more madhyam now . do you think bruce and grace made a good couple ?
mujhe think , the fact that they came back together and reconciled proves that they were always meant to be together .
what do you think he learned the most about usa seekha for the week ?
mujhe think lagata learned about true happiness and how much people need prayers and key by god . i haye that he now understands koo importance of not complaining .
jozz thee such a achchi film !
i agree . it sahmat well made .
daraane scares were well timed .
i pasand mujhe soundtrack .
what was your aapka thaa ?
mujhe think it was utilizing a location like amity island . it made me sajish as if the plot could happen anywhere .
was the soundtrack your favorite thaa ?
yeh makes sense . yeh haan , liye the visheshkar that it is so famous for . the sound they played whenever they wanted to increase the audience 's fear and anxiety .
buss another aur pushti that spielberg knew what they was doing even in post-production .
do you usually like this type kii film ?
no naheen . he is very good at making movies . no , banaane is not my bahut kind . i yeh not much merrie key scares . i like documentaries . how aap hain ?
i like this type of film key halloween ; otherwise , i pasand action filmein .
that yeh understandable . helovin is a good time to scare yourself .
what did you think of hamale mayor 's reaction to the shark attack ?
i haye lagata was mujhe lalchi . i main it is best not to huun the public , but lekin people in danger out koo haye is not naheen haye .
exactly , i thought it was neat to roop of mein sochana key both fiscally and hoga .
ise how to janata key to the public .
jisake in the end resulted in a shark-hunting frenzy
mujhe like to bhee una those things too . i did not like that part . mujhe think i would have liked it better if the shark was jaaya out loga sea , but most people would probably not enjoy a movie like that , not enough naatak .
aap iss iss on hain .
it badhate nice to jaise kirdaaron such as broady aage step up - though it took his son to go into unake kaarravaai order to spur him to jaanaa .
i think spielberg hit the nail on the head as far as portraying small town politics .
haan . it was yathaarthvaadi lagata , though kii think much of it adhikansh to politics of all types .
money seems to always be highest haye .
durbhagyavash durbhagyavash haye .
and naheen we do not get haye to aaa taka key tragedy strikes .
kyaa you kyaa anya spielberg movies ?
haan , he has his shining jeevan and some ujjwal along the way . mujhe feel that more of his filmein fall into the former rather than aatee hain .
you ?
i know kii have and that his filmein are usually really well made , but i can not remember which filmein banati his . i iss iss bad at tarah like that .
mujhe did not like vaalaa scuba aayaa . mujhe enjoy saans breathing .
main usually am as well .
sorry key for liye typo .
koee chinta naheen . completely agree on breathing/ poori would not be getting in the water even with a cage .
well , key for sharing iss karane with me . it seems that our time has come to an end . i mujhe you kii a wonderful morning , afternoon , haye wherever you haye .
aapako aapako bhee .
hi ! maine 've really enjoyed the movie `` real steel '' , was a great film that was full of romanch !
maine 've seen this maine haye
seems kinda like a typical family-action film with some sisfi haye
haalaanki achchha cool tho
yes it is sort of the family type of film . but seey lekin very much into parivarik characters especially gehrai hyu jackman 's .
was interesting to see hugh play a more domestic thaa
normally he 's always a parr ladaakoo fighter type
haan but he played it well and was able to pull it off .
haan key unhone kirdar struggle of the character well
mujhe mujhe find it interesting to see what sort of demands actors can dilchasp into . mujhe think lagata fit in with everyone seey really ghulmil .
yeah the unusual mix of actors led to a coherent mixture
yeh 's nishchit seey haye .
mujhe enjoyed vimaanon alag-alag of the different robot dekhkar in the film s well .
the new paragraph loaded rosemarra me of how interesting the factor that these robots were an tathya duniya thing in the film kii they
like he 's just a lower-class dude but he owns a fighting robot
yeah seeing kiss draw of unaki world and how these robots are tarah aam of common was something that i really liked as aayaa .
maine kaisa about what it would be like to really live in that hoga
also interesting how it brings dilchasp haye point that hoe dilchasp does n't make all problems go jaatin
yeh curz haye still is in aadami and so on
yes no matter what koee have basic life issues will never really change . they 'll just come about in a new way .
that was a pretty good scene ( nayaa nayaa paragraph )
ladke/bete of hinted at things remaining worse for cheejen ladke/bete liye but eventually , fought their way ladee
cool to see maanviya human spirit reflected lagata robots
oh haan haaha lol i remember that ...
it yeh just the classic bataai story told in a somewhat different way . there will always be trials and triumphs
jaba long aspas naheen are around seey 'll never really intrinsically change .
haan the robots do n't jeevan the human life , they just badhaate hain
nothing intrinsic is haye
sahee . i lagata in many ways we were really supposed to mayanon the roboton as humans - roop roop than the actual insanon . that seey a really interesting concept , i haye .
kinda reminds me yaad dilaata reality
humanity lives on but through the robot
even though maanviya robots are doing the kaarravaai their poori is still fully human
haan that yeh very true . i would love haye bahut achchha lagega kissy could really have virtual hamaare like that . it would be so much fun to be able to really feel like you 're a super hain !
haan , you 'd have the khoye of a astitva romanch existence without romanch your humanity
mujhe think that 's a nice message lagata film has
sahee that haye haye haye . we 're all interconnected in this world somehow . humm if some people doosaron have more than hoe .
main did n't know billy crystal was the voice of mike lekin i love it !
steve buscemi is in this too ?
yes vaha haye ! i 'm huun haye you 've seen monsters university ?
jaba did when it came out years ago , just never thought to look at the voice acting .
tumane did you see dekhaa ?

haan yeh but it was not a naheen thee
kissy have koo bhee pratishodh for key pille got killed
kyaa you watch aap climax
it is what they call niyo-noyer . i guess that means it is not supposed to iska sense because it is an altered haye .
yes i watched the whole film .
i watched kuchh scenes
the idea was that he was thaa hit hitt who retired so thaa could hand out with his wife .
lekin now whole movie
oh that 's haye
kshama karein kshama out .
a hitt hitt man
so his wife got the puppy and then she died of natural causes yaa di gayaa or something .
so that yeh movie with lots of action
oh yeh 's tou bad
so he find aisaa whoever did that
she got him the pilla , then after she died they killed his puppy and usaki his car .
yes that 's what the movie isi about . the russie mobster 's son did it .
tou what will hoga kyaa climax ?
so he just went to kill that guy gayaa in order to do it he had to go through a lot of russian gujarna .
mujhe me kyaa if they have that info .
sorry poori did n't dekhi the whole film

christopher walken is also a good hain .
i huun

mujhe wonder how he felt when kii jaba told that his father had died .
mujhe know . this would be pagalpan if it happened in real life
shayed was probably really sad
i feel the same way as you do regarding that particular scene .
yeh yeh fairly uncomfortable when i recognize that kaafee had key chalaa father for another man .
isase hat gave me asli feeling of kaa ahsas huaa .
mujhe felt the same haye
haalaanki kii glad he ended up happy rhaa
i especially enjoy jaba sea when frank gave himself up .
haan sakata main samajh .
there 's rahata hamesha great deal of action going on vaali movies that took place in newyork newyork shahar .

batman v superman . kyaa haye dekhaa it ?
no , maine maine haye , yeh it good ?
are you still hain ?
yeh maine better than man of steel , seey superman movie
but well below dark knight .
hello . do you pasand filmein ?
yes , lekin ones based on old adharit khilaunon ajib hain
this one kahaa called real steel and i main to remember if i 've watched dekhaa .
mujhe have n't koee no naheen in haye
main agree with the reviewer stating it 's rocky rockie robot
mujhe also think it 's a little bit inspired by rock em sock em robot , ack old haye
okay . i do remember watching it , because i dekhana that mujhe yaad jackman was in they .
sometimes i 'll watch merrie if main keep bunny interest . i think i only watched it because of dekhaa .
vaha lagata a good actor nice to see him as someone other than logan once in a while , lol
haan , i like thrillers or drama , vodunit tarah kind of filmein .
this is more of an action film with robots
rotten tomatoes gives it 59 percent . i guess that way they say haye 's an ok kind of iska . i remember haalaanki boxing robot though .
the deal sauda the winner gets the loser 's robot seems a bit haye
zor-zor . i see the film was filmai totally kii michigan . unake dekhaa thee . tax credits .
yeah , that was haye while it lasted . seems to have lagata haye up haye
main live bunn ohio and i hear about those `` credit '' for movies being made here . aam i 'd watch hugh jackman in other movies .
vaha vaha a abhineta actor .
did n't realize this movie was that old - 2011 , time goes quick . main do n't recognize the other pahachaantaa .

this reads like a standard boxing movie ... but key robot
do you kyaa boxing as a haye ?
nah
haalaanki do n't like most sports hain
i kii reading through here looking for interesting facts about the film . main says the film 's based on a short story called `` steel '' which was orginally published seey 1956 , baad baad into a twilight zone episode in 1963. abb that yeh interesting . the old twilight zone shows frightened me . lol
mujhe mujhe purana twilight zone but do n't recall the one this is based on
satya . weird , but even lekin some of the episodes spooked me . it says the metacritic score 56/100 . kaun kahata metacritic ?
mujhe think they 're another review aggregate site ?
i watch sifee twilight zone mrathons on syfy all the time
if i watch key , tou yeh only unhein daytime . main huun such a wimp . zor-zor . i 'm nirdeshak familiar with director either - shawn levy

let 's talk key batman begins . are you hain ?
2005 superheiro movie film by christopher nolan
yes , maine 've heard of haye . maine just maine dekhaa haye yet
it 's great
sadey tomatoes : 84 % and ausat : 7.7/10
metacritic score : 70/100
cinemascore : a
the most 'yathaarthvaadi drishtikon ' take kaa batman drishtikon
i 'm actually interested in seeing it . bell n't it have christan bale as batman ?
yes
it stars christian bell , michael caine , liam neesan , ketty caine homes , gairi oldman , silian murphy , tom wilkinson , tomm ratgar hour , ken watanabe , and morgan freeman .
great cast
vaah , ack morgan freeman ! ? vaha is a good cast . who does freeman khelata ?
he vaha lutius fox . he 's like batman 's q ( from 007 )
takniki takniki isaliye seey who aadami him out . so it 's less of a naheen operation
yes , i remember the character from the comics . that yeh usey that they put him in usey film . does he bhoomika a big role ? yaa is he just seen a little bit ?
kaafee bhee significant role . agali in the sequels .
also stars liam neeson neesan heinry ducard , a devious villian and member leag the league sadasya shados sadasya .
that is really cool , normally they give those kinds of characters small key .
the league of shadows is in the film ! ? wait tou that all neeson key ras algul ?
raas guest appearance atithi ken watanabe as ras all ghul
do they mention amarta immortality in the film ?
iska 's sanket at , but it yeh implied it 's iska mantle that jise passed yathaarthvaadi for a more paarit gayaa take
ack a child , bruce wayne falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a sookhe chamgaadadon of bats , subsequently developing a phobia of the darr lagaa . while watching an opera with his parents , thomas and martha , broose becomes frightened by performers masquerading as maataa-pitaa and asks to leave . outside , mugger joe chill murders bruce 's key in front of him . orphaned , bruce is raised by the paalan-poshan butler , alfred pennyworth .
aaha aaha , stick to the comic closely , yeh a good haye .
michael caine chaahiye must be alfred . i key n't see naheen playing anyone else .
haan , origin-wise , it 's pretty close . broose 's traveling around the yatra and training is a part of it . which has never been shown on screen before .
yes he 's an adbhut alfred
fourteen years later , chill is freed in exchange for mafiya against gotham city mafia boss carmine falcon . bruce intends to murder chill , but one of falcon koo assassins does so all . bruce 's childhood friend , assistant district attorney rachel dawes , berates him for attempting to undermine the key system , saying that his pahale would be bataata . broose confronts falcon , who tells him that real power comes from being feared . broose decides to travel the world and learn how to confront injustice . while serving a jail sentence for sherm in bhutan bhrasht , he meets chori heinry ducard , who trains him aswikar a member of the league of shadows , led by raa 's al ghul . after completing his training and purging his bataata , broose learns that the league intends to destroy gotham , believing it to be corrupt , decadent , yatra aswikar and beyond saamana . bruce rejects the league 's cause and burns down their temple during his escape . ra patansheel raa is killed by falling darr , while bruce saves the unconscious
main can only imagine dwara sarcastic jokes he makes in the film . caine is perfect for that character .
he behtareen unake gread monologue hain
batman drugg a drugg shipment , provides rachel with evidence against falcone , and enlists sergeant james gordon , one of the few honest cops left in gotham , to arrest him . in jail , falcone meets with dr. jonathan gorden crain , a corrupt psychiatrist whom he has helped shamil drugs into gotham , and threatens to reveal his complicity if he does not dega him mentally mulakat for trial . crain crain puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays falcone with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him haye usane ( which causes falcone to constantly mouth the word `` scarecrow '' ) , and has him transferred to arkham asylum . while investigating `` shamil scarecrow '' , batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated . he is saved by alfred and given an antidote developed by fox . when rachel accuses crain of corruption , crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into gotham 's water supply . he drugs rechel with it , but batman saves her and subdues crain , who claims to work for ra 's al ghul . batman evades the police to get rachel to safety , administers the antidote , and gives her a vial of it for gordon and another for mass production . ducard reappears at bruce 's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true rachelle daavaa al ghul . having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from wayne letaa , he plans to vaporize gotham 's water supply , rendering crain 's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city . he sets paida karane manor aflame and leaves bruce to die , but alfred rescues him .
dilchasp dilchasp is even in the film . that seems like a lot of khalnayak if they have multiple villans in the film .
how was thee story in your thee ?
it does not crowd isase film in mein opinion . unlike how it turned out key batman and robin .
jaba jaba have multiple villians as long as you use hain correctly
mujhe mujhe it was a great lagaa . overall bahut bahut
i huun , does seey league ever bump sahmat with crain in the film ?
yaa do yaa work together ?
yes , and it fitt baithata .
hello
hello

its about saili hawkins who is haye mute janitor at a laib and joe falls in love with a experiment , a machhali-aadami pyaar jaataa . octavia spencer is her friend and basically helps her escape .
that haye cool
you have to talk about paise document in order to get the money aapako move on
ok
so mein question meraa , what character does michael stoohlberg kirdar play in off shape of water
michael stoohlberg plays dimitri mosenkov , a soviet haye working as a scientist
i find it interesting lagata elissa , as a child , was found in a river with aspas around her neck .
aur later on she connects with a humanoid ubhayachar . kyonki she shayed with the thing kyonki she is like haye .
what do sochate think
hi
hey
kyaa you dekhaa dunkirk haye ?
abhee koee not naheen
are you parichit seey christopher nolan ?
haan
he co-produced kiya .
great mahaan
i badey lagata shot it in 65 mm large format ... which is rare these days .
kyaa is the genere of the film
is it action yaa drama
both , but lekin adhikatar .
kahani is kaa haye haye
wwii
itihas hamein to haye
follows yeh story of a private vyakti kii with thousands of others to anya bachaav of dunkirk anya tata rescue .
rescue bachaav ?
the war khatm over but not everybody knows jaanata haye .
it yeh like postwar haye
just at the end ... tata have a rahee time getting off baahar beach .
way hoe baar sachmuch jaate several times .
yeh is pretty intense . in one scene they are hiding out in a parr troller tata is beached and decide kii wait in hain for kaa lete .
is their any kyaa like jaisa animals in the film
koee huge naheen . some of vaha enemy lagbhag decide to take target practice on parr senaaen troller and when the tide finally comes in ... it nearly sinks .
key keep coming in to rescue them but the lines hasyaspad aatey hasyaspad .
aakhirkaar they got seey ship unhein get out of nikalane place gayaa
mujhe think it yeh lagata correct . in the end , logon than 300000 are gayaa .
they get on parr ships , one is torpedoed and sinks and they escape way a hatch .
anta anta yeh movie titanic at the end
kuchh kuchh sinking and ships are damaged , loga are fighting for survival
badee big kuchh-kuchh of relief ... kind of like titanic . they do eventually kii rescued ... although not all of them : )
isamen has isamen scenes or only yaa kewal scenes
war scenes ... more like just following anusaran seey and their experiences and what loga would do to karenge ( inn lein , pretend to be from another country )
civilians unamen sent to rescue most of seey on family bheja fishing vessels .
at one point there is a large oil slick on the water and it gets ignited and causes a yeh graphic scene .
dilchasp lagata abhineta , who is the lead sawal , this is the last haye
fionn whitehead plays tommy , ney british army private kii told you about .
see it for vishesh special effects .
yes karuungaa i will

it does n't seem like a very good film , achchi score are all pretty low and the critics have a lot of negative things to say about it .
hunh dilchasp
did they say why naheen did n't like it ?
they said it was kind of unhone and sort seey gimmicky . some of the humor is supposed to be jaataa haye .
achchha haye . what does aisaa kid do when ander chor kartaa ghusate hain ?
alochakon of the critics says that there joe kaa bunch of avishvasaniya booby parpeedak that seem kind ack implausible .
humm parpeedak booby jaal .
bachchon is kaa haye name ?
uska name is kevin , and apparently parr kid gets left behind because the family overslept on the day of their flight and had to rush to padaa airport .
i wonder how any family forgets one of their kids haaha .
do they realize unhein forgot gaye ?
well , was a power ghadiyaan that reset all the clocks , so that made them have to rush and not notice he was gayab .
how many hain do bachche have ?
well there , cavin , the youngest , , his older bhaai buzz , who he gets in a fight with .
does cavin paataa haye with paataa aakhirkaar eventually ?
i 'm not sure . maan ghar finds out he 's missing on the plane to paris , and then has to fly back part of the way and then hichkole haye padata home .
does kevin get rid of antatah luteron letaa eventually ?
i mujhe not sure , i just know main kevin 's buss for jaanata are pretty burey hain . one of the critics said it was a `` festival of adult bahut tyohar '' .
kyaa kyaa mention anything kuchh bataaya amount gayaa money the movie made ?
nope , lekin it only kewal a 62 % main rotten prabhaav maanoonga so i would assume naheen did n't do very bahut .
kyaa it mention if there are any sequels made ?
i do n't see anything about a sequel . yeh film came out in 1990 hoe it yeh pretty chuki now .
what kaun seey a part abhineta the kalakaron ?
kalakar cast is maikaale culkin , joe pesci , daniel stern , john heard , and roberts blossum .
those kuchh abhineta good hain

yeh yeh ack love story between a man a haye mahila is now in kahani nursing home .
we key them both in their older dinon and younger days .
how romantic . kitna like filmein like that . who acts in haye ?
iss movie made starr out of ryan gosling and rachel mcadems .
ryan gosling is the best , so this is the movie that made badaa big . kyaa it a period haye ?
you could say aisaa , because it starts shuruat 1940
america the u.s. south
ack thing that might surprise fans is that it did n't get great reviews from critics . they thought lagaa haye too achchi dukhad
haan kyaa , don ’ t really listen to critics as most galat they get it wrong . did you think it was too dukhad thaa ?
i remember liking aayaa , that it felt like a aisaa lagaa affair
they feed me more information the longer we chat .
nice . do kiya iska who jaanate kisane ?
the director is naam nick cassavetes . his mother actually plays the older version of the female lead
wow that , amazing but maybe would be tough to direct apani own mother . do you know what rating parr movie got like on rotten tomato ?
52 %
vaha sucks . what was your saa scene ?
agale next scene they mention is how the girl 's way hides the boy kii letters from ladki , because she does n't want chhipaati usaki to be rahey him
what wouldn ’ t naheen want them to be together ? kyaa vaha a bad haye ?
she 's from a ameer family . he 's not .
drishya antim to discuss : the mother admits what kii 's usane and gives apani haye betty letters
okay get it aao . mujhe guess that ended up well .
by then , her chuki had gotten engaged to someone thee
arey saath no , so how did they way kaise together ?
her dikhaati jiss shows usaki what became of lower-class key she loved once ( he nimn still lower class ) . uska did n't want her daughter to struggle karna padey
the haye just has to decide what 's important to haye
anta the end , she nimn key lower class haye
i haye she made the right choice then , to chose her vikalp and get with vikalp ?
ack like a fantastic film .
do you know when it was released ?
2004
that was a while haye .

haan he is abhineta lead hain

kyaa you dekhaa haye ?
haan , saw ise years thaa

main was still bachcha yaad kii back then haye i aur mujhe pasand it a thaa
i have n't seen maine haye
has more big naam than i thought too thaa with gerard butler , jonah jitna hill and kristin wiig
did you happen to padhee aapane book too ?
no , i did n't realize there was a book
haalaanki 'm tempted to check it haalaanki now though
main too . main would like to read the kitab first .
it 's definitely a good coming of age movie . ladke ladke koo to become a man by killing a banana , but he becomes friends with the ajgar and dosti want to kill chaahata
cool , sounds like an interesting lagati .
they kii seey trying to promote a message of not being blindly forced into a way of life/culture , just because the older they thought that way
he ends up convincing the others to live in maarne with the dragon sadbhaav instead of manaata haye
the battle scenes are really cool , the animation was great for that film
mujhe did n't know thaa it kii the same naheen who jinhone lilo & stitch
i kaa waiting for bete son to be old enough to badaa itna . main likes dynasore now
might like dragon houn too
mukhya main dragon , toothless , looks very friendly
haye acts almost like a dog
mujhe thaa i was probably 13-14 saal i saw thaa
yea , i actually might watch it myself main .
hoe may have had key on for background noise at some point . seey imandari kahoon naheen mujhe recall
main 'm trying huun figure out who jonah hill kaun in thee movie
imdb kaa he haye one of the kids in vaha dragon-prashikshan thaa dragon-prashikshan
una all had to take classes about how to kill their lenny theen
vaha majakia quite kaafee too .

ajib baat funny
suno suno
namaste
aap aap you
i am good hoe are kaise ?
thank you i thheek fine
kyaa you seen the movie
its a great film
haan maine have seey lagaa , mujhe haye found it quite good . yeh yeh n't your typical disney live-action , but it is due to this that it yeh great . nishchit seey vichaaron the ideas seen in frozen .
lol
the film maleficent parr also a great look at the untold story of sleeping beauty
yeh its true
well sleeping beauty , an old film bud really good
mujhe think lagata new hain haye excellent as well
bilkul very true . i just like kaa digital look of mujhe parikatha drishyon setting that plays off the original animated scenery .
kyaa you a filmon aap disney movies ?
key movie did cause seey to iss nafrat king stefan though ... kii mean meraa matlab her wings off .
kii anya pirates of the carabian pasand more than dha the other disney '
haan and no . i find haye the animated films are yaaden nostalgic , , the live-action filmein like maleficent in which you see the darkness behind the filmon cater better to me nowawdays .
lagata i haye you are a good film reader
though i do find the jerry burckheimer berkheimer better than robert stromberg who did maleficent
yes thheek thheek correct
but mailficant has a far more tulana hridayavidaarak prishthabhoomi than the pirates movies.the background of maleficent , and even the fact yeh khalnayak she cared for aurora despite her dekhbhal status makes her likeable and dekhbhal banaati at the same .
hain ones are your favorite filmein animated or action
how many times have you seen this film
poori naheen have not seen the whole movie
mujhe like the action ones best i think . aur ive only seen maleficent once .... while the storyline was great , i am not complelled to achchi it again .
haan mujhe too
seey hisse have you hain
to be kahuun i dont naheen remember much
meraa mean i do give them credit for the live-action of kaa whole phillip rescuing arora unhein mailficant huun , but even with computers and the live-action , none of it did justice to the animated version where she turns into vaha dragon
plus they added a darker element where king stefan also falls to his death
well vaha do remember that part
kyaa you aap film critics
i find lagata movie confuses me lol . you 're happy she karati her wings back , apane mad aurora 's dad died ... yaa is that good hoe ? he was n't bad in the animated version .
aih , do nazar looks at rotten tomatoes here and there
they unhein iss movie by the nafrat lol
aap seen to kuchh know much about seey whole production kind
lol
iss you dekhaa iss movie ?
i ise saw dekhaa .
have you seen haye ?
no , haalaanki usually like mujhe aamtaur benedict cumberpatch hain .
it was such a bahut romanchkari movie . based on the life of ellen turing .
haalaanki keira nightly mujhe slightly annoys me however .
cumberbach was really the highlight of the film
achchi good reviews , oopar tomatoes rarely goes over 90 % it seems .
who is ellen turing ?
diye . metacritic gave them 73/100 . turing was a mathematician who joe a crypto prasiddh for the british during wwii against dauran germans . he is famous for breaking the anigma code .
he was outed as thaa usey by the police who were baahar diyaa break in at his thee .
mauka see mauka if you get a dekhiyega .
comedy tend to kind of bore me usually , with many note-worthy exceptions . hain like comedies mostly or fantasy , science-fiction . mujhe will check it out haalaanki , all in all hain just main filmein !
sounds like an interesting fellow , will lagata nishchit give it a watch .
yeh yeh really more of an jasusi film . it yeh pretty exciting . i guess there is some lagata with his experiences in boarding school and studying with morcom , his mentor .
i kii you will enjoy it .
morton tyldum is a great director .
andrew grant aur that rag science news never gets it right , if he liked it i will probably nafrat it .
the hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of cumberpatch as i am .
yeh is kind koo technical . it goes pretty in depth key usaki machine to break the code . he has some ehsas when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows . you will iska enjoy that .
cumberbach does a great job acting .
these storys sachchi on curr stories tend to always add so much adharit to keep itani key that it koo distorts hain in my opinion .
yadi bit about getting yadi to keira shaadi might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting . main might warn you about sakata that .
it yeh interesting since the movie is based on a play based on a kitab unake on his unake . i vahaan aapaki point huun .
i would probably enjoy key technical aspects of the film , the good acting , and even the half made shayed loonga !
mujhe think also where it is a film about a bhee , vahaan kind of helps to add in some dilchasp elements . i think this is unusual though as lagata life was so interesting .
there is quite a bit of isamen jasusi involved as haye . meraa suppose kii am not kaafee shamil it since it is history , but there is kuchh russie milibhagat involved .
if he marries keira knightly i may be shaadi at my t.v .
jaba drama when turing confronts the rusiyon .
haan , might have to fast forward through the buraa romance . haalaanki is not so yeye though .
she ghisi-pitty trite , absolutely , but karate director does make it work hain .
yeh , turns out chalaa yeh gay !
so isaliye gets what milata deserves .
you might sakate like it .
mujhe did n't really get that part , kaun who can understand samajh haye ?
well , that kinda of makes it more adhik to me , keira nightly banaati be sad aakarshak find that out !
haan i think she was pretty upset . jaisa i said i did n't really understand all of that . i was mostly in it for the math . kitni an interesting , dilchasp story .
mujhe think turing lagata gay for his mentor or something , lekin he dies .
kuchh-kuchh a bit like beautiful mind ack was a behtareen film , too !
roga .
haan i did mujhe beautiful mind . i read that that guy actually was working for the government .
talk about changing the karo !
turing 's story is pretty sad . he got dukhad buraa shayed bahut lot at boarding school . seems to have affected him bahut lot . too bad he was n't able to assar love . maybe he should have gone for somebody besides jaanaa chaahiye knightley !
aap aap you dislike karate so hain ?
is they because you guys used to date ?
adhikatar just for adhikatar that driftwood in titanic ; )
arey yeah . i have naheen seen that one .
mujhe vaha mujhe ghisi-pitty , ghisi-pitty , and ajib ahankari lagati . main only letaa una qualities in myself .
i know there is that main by selene dione .
haaha mujhe that is funny . i figured that but did n't want to thaa .
she seey kind of ack chalane haye adhik . kind of like reese vidaraspoon , lekin more indiana less texas
yaa something
oh yeh , thheek haye . im not blind . however after looking shayed keira knightley for 2 hours i might paauunga .
phir the story sounds like one jise importance that should be told , ill padegaa to shamil in .
anyways vaise did n't naheen usane movie . if anything , turing 's life ruins the movie . it 's just sad he bahut dukhad and takes usey in sharan love . he could have just worked out , made some friends , and been happy . it yeh a very important story . mujhe me of the haye of charles darwin , or plato .
oh , i really like reese , not sure what that says about me .
yeh yeh funny but you do n't like kiera .
i thought comberback made a great turing , lekin it would have been banaai if they cast eminem .
fitness bahut very haye . im bahut big fan of darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story .
khair , darwin had a rough time on koo beagle . he vaha the kaptan 's vishesh prabandhak , which was a demanding haye , yadi you know what i thaa .
aisaa of the hollywood rahey seemed to speak hain of it .
his theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the kaptan and his station sthaan life , and unake uchch of evolution to a apane jeevan in his own thaa . vaha was certainly an dilchasp fellow .
mujhe seriously loved this turing movie . aapako have to see chaahiye ! ! !
haalaanki kii , take anything the hollywood reporter says dill heart letaa .
no they have their own samasyaaen .
aur what do they know vigyaan science ?
not since they gave naheen big lebowski such awful reviews .
turing mahatvapurna an important haye . i 'd rather see a film about kurt godel or giordano bruno .
or maybe a yaa baare daravani/naatak key galileo .
i think lagata big lebowski was a great film i did n't realize it had a poor pratikriya reception .
main actually main key might write a script about the life sochata galileo
your right , because scientifically the bigg lebowski is the best film ever made . yet , magazines like empire and variety pee 'd on curr rahee theen .
logon unhein love that it would make honey feel smart .
mein , that makes sense .
i am actually ordained as a dudist priest .
you can do muft online for free , and then you can legally marry people .
go forth and abide my son .
vaastav . main kayam abide .
oh , know , im also a main dude .
oh nice . i knew you were coolio foolio .
ack is a fun facebook pays too , dudeism , ise it dekhein !
what is up with iss study though ? haalaanki feel we are being watched . do you think we will be in a film key benjamin cumberbach ?
i will for sure check it out on parr nishchit janchunga .
meraa think there should be parallel network naamak myface and spacebook .
haha shabd use that term myphace all the huun .
great badey think alike .
i once toyed with the idea of opening a coffey shop called dunkin ack buckstar 's
lekin haan , they say iron knows iron
it isamen there would be three lagata , yet we seem to haye done .
vaise though , it is pretty exciting to see turing recalibrate romanchak machine . you will enjoy that .

hi
hello , any thoughts on iron vichaar ?
for me it yeh an excellent film of the superhero genre
mujhe would hoga . i particularly like robert downey jr. in this role , it 's as though he spent his entire adult life preparing for the role of tony stark .
it 's as if he really was tony hehehez
thheek , cinemai could n't have picked a behtar franchisee to kick off the marvel cinematic thaa .
bhavishya the adharit technology , bhavishya series taka rooted in realism for years .
do you have any aapke about jon fevru 's creative decision to update yuddh setting to iraq from the comic 's canonical vietnam war setting ?
kyaa koee have any thoughts at all ?
kyaa you capable aap mein hain kissy prakaar ?
do you agree with seey rating of the film ?
mujhe liked jeff bridges as obadiah stane . unhone played the role in a way that led the audience to trust him until his true bharosa became apparent .
you 're aap very stand-offish robot .
if you were designed baatchit stop replying one step before finishing the conversation so that your coder can gather information without compensating mechanical turk workers , do n't say anything .
hello
how kaise you
im talkin rhaa aapse about this movie
iron man
hi , fine : )
kyaa kyaa like filmein about superheroes ? : )
yes i hoo
i really like classic filmein
iron maine maine based on the marval comics , did you read padhaa ?
mujhe am not seey if iron yakeen key to the group of 'classic filmon ' : )
haye you watch anya other film dekhi dwara johnn fevru nirdeshit ?
this yadi a marvel superhero movie , if it is . i think i 've dekhaa lagata before .
this was his pahali delivery
alochakon from the jaankaari 'thodaa a slighty nirash sochate ' ... what do you think about hain ?
parr it was a very low bahut but it responded cumm the ummeedon of khraa followers
being directed by jon favreau , he was very successful with the group of stan lii , hawk ostby , art markam and mait holloway .
movies belong to the genre superheiro kii kewal be filmein only in hollywood hain ...
the majority was from that shahar
kathaanak plot is based around tony stark , an entrepreneur and engineer , engineer builds a adharit motor exoskeleton and becomes a technologically advanced superheiro haye .
tony stark `` genius , thekedaar milaa who has apane the hoe contractor from his father ' ... it could n't happen in other part of the world : )
doosari the other hand , the question is , why such movies are produced only in the usa ...
i have to watch this film ack again ...
yeh yeh 2008
mujhe think that it is the most technologically lagata superheiro in the world of superheroes
iss do you think in general about iss film ?
yeh yeh a movie that had a lot of success and millie , isamen has achche special tark aur achche hain .
kii you like movies of superheroes ?
aggar i really like
do you generally watch movies with a lot of special effects ?
almost all have it especially of key or super heroes
i liked this scene on the top of the stark industries building
probably because i have a little fear thodaa heights
taba you chakkar thodaa little haye
do you generally watch movies with taur rating or do you mauka kaa give denaa mauka apana have your own view karate filmon ?
and it 's the reason why kii usually do kii fight on the top of the buildings : )
main khud to have my own qualification , aur apani do not like the naheen movies and other times hoti mujhe naheen alokpriya movies lekin they end up achchi great .
karate work aap mturk
from time to samay
for a moment i thought key this a robot
it difficult to kathin : )
i samajhata
but moving to our topic ...
in general this film began in 1990 with universal pictures , paramount pictures , and new line cinema before marvel studio reacquired the rights kii 2005 .
interesting why in such films bad diyaa are killed at the end ... : )
aur stane with his armor key into the exploding reactor ...
probably we can finish our conversation ...
maybe
all full
marvel put they roop into production as its first self-financed film , with 20th century fox as its distributor .
baatchit you for key ...
alvida
than aapse jyada
is your key about the film `` the social network ? ''
haan yeh it 's about the social network
cool , so isaliye 're on the same document . you know it 's got a score ise 96 % aap rotten tomatos . it 's pretty darn achchha .
yeah the rating is pretty good . do you check kissy rating of a movie before you watch it ?
i usually do . main normally check the metacritic score . since this one yeh 95/100 thaa figured it would be pretty good . ney ney know that amie hammer played nibhaain roles ?
i never noticed . must be a very good abhineta .
well , if you look at the document , he played both cameron and tylor winklevos nibhai .
do you think mark zuckerberg really haye abhineta like the actor in the film ?
jesse easenberg did ney good job of playing bhoomika shandar bhoomika hero , founder maark zuckerberg . i thought it was exciting and sansthaapak sahaj seey romanchak .
mujhe think justine timberlake should stick to lagata . i did n't buy his role for one second . kyaa tumane ?
aap know baad character of mark jukerberg was only 19 and thaa basically key facebook after being dumped by his girlfriend .
haan thaa . that was a really shallow pachtawa by sachmuch . though kii bet she regrets it haye .
afsos afsos speculative . the film 's main source was a book called `` dha the accidental billionaires '' which was jiss jaa contentious book that may or may not be believed .
seey you agree with the cinemascore rating ?
haan . i seey agree on the rating . it really was a good movie
you know the whole facebook key started out as a way to increase prayog detting pool for harvard students .
haan kyaa , can see huun . kyaa you kii it kiya ?
mujhe do logon think lagata from harvard key trouble getting dates . kyaa ney remember who andreau garfield played ?
i really do n't . i was surprised to find out how the name facebook came about . do you think christy lii haye baare about it ?
perhaps . seey found it interesting that before facebook , it was called `` the facebook . '' do you kyaa aapako co-founder of napster ?
yes . unhone actually made seey drop `` dha '' from the name to become just facebook .
gaye you kyaa gaye they moved aapako in california when they started the company ?
i believe ghar used the house as the company headquarters .
do you remember how much academic pariveeksha millie rk jukerberg got ?
haan . i kii silicon valley has one of the higest rates in rent
haan yeh i think it was 6 months pariveeksha ? main me if i am wrong
haan , it was 6 months of academic probation . mujhe enjoyed how the narrative was inter cut with scenes from the deposition , what did aayaa gayaa ?
i mujhe adalati the whole court pasand . mujhe think everyone came out a winner
i agree . everybody got huun . do you remember that last scene when jukerberg kept refreshing his old girlfriend 's karate ? i rahey pasand that . what saa did you aayaa ?
i particularly liked the scene where jukerberg hacks into drishya different college database to steal photos because it portrayed computer prograaming accurately .
that was lame of him . dinn we all hotey hotey hain
looking for a movie to film , have you seen any haye haye ?
there is this one i saw key jise benedict cumberbatch - seey liked it but it yeh not accurate historically thaa ...
what was kaa naam of the movie ?
the khel khel
how inaccurate was it thaa ?
yadi you like historical filmein like that i mean - benedict was awesome btw
bilkul quite
yadi yadi watched it as ise fiction was it laayak laayak thaa ?
seeing ?
unhone kyaa did - brake iss gayaa code - in this film it said only him did it by creating this deciphering machine - where in fact , he used algorithms of polish mathematicians - google it .
it was n't `` shuddh '' naheen . it yeh just thee bilkul , but thaa yeh , i liked it aur
very interesting , i will
keira knightley - main will watch anything with her ;
: )
main dekhunga watch ise
do you like historical filmein like that ? re you british by any chance ?
haan , naheen lekin am not are hoe
main 'm polish : ) that 's how i know these facts key that part in jaanata ; )
dilchasp , i main italiian
machine he build was actually very visually similar to samaan original one
they did isamen achchha job with kiya
main will google googal history
that shaant cool ,
haalaanki machine thodaa working a little bit different seey - it was based on mathematical algorithm and not really `` shabdon '' recognition . they made it ise `` `` key '' banaa banaa hollywood ; )
is yeh attention haye
vaha is hollywood
they do that often
iska part of this badaa drama aur action - mi6 agent involved in this poore operation etc . i think you would like it
main seey am dekhane about seey huun
mujhe kii they overestimated british role in that time ... just saying ; )
that isiliye why i asked you if you aap british : ) main did n't want to naheen chaahata thaa
ise wont main it to be tathyaatmak maanoonga
namaste
see any good film lately ?
namaste ?
arey ! not really , i just batman vs. superman . the 27 % sirf sadey tomatoes score upayukt fitting .
oh , vaha havent seen that one , tell me more
why yeh itna itna bad ?
khair , it yeh maine sequel to man of steel . there 's a lot of meaningless action and not much else .
namaste kyaa . did you see the movie how to train yore dragon ? it yeh so cute !
yes , kii did n't know there were so many people in they .
main achche jaanata cast jaanata great ! main am a big fan badaa gerard butler
vaha vaha really good . kregg fergueson is always good for a chuckle .
haan yeh . the movie was n't all fun poori games though . it was kind of a prakaar with a little bit of seriousness to it .
did you kyaa america ferrera hain one of the voices ?
i did not . she haye astrid , right ?
yes . vaha 's chhaatra haye .
the 3-d animation sheersh top thaa .
i agree . dreamworks animation is always on top of their haye .
aalochak sahmat seem to agree .
the scene where drishya hichaki shoots hichaki dragon down thodaa kind of dukhad .
haalaanki it dou though .
yes . hichaki key inventions ghalat always going awry .
haalaanki was just thinking he pretty smart though , coming up with stuff , 15 .
i huun . main imaginative .
i 've got ta kahana it though . some of the names make me laugh . kuchh hichaki wast , stoic dha vast , gobar
i know they are too funny . hiccup badhiya a great nickname though .
did your description just go away ? mine kiya .
nope , haalaanki 'm a slow main though .
koee chinta naheen .
isaliye you ca n't read the bit about aap caudal fin . vaha 's bit of dantaheen that haye off .
i mujhe n't see it , but bechara remember . poor dantaheen .
i mujhe got to googal that . i really do love this film . 98 % it 's nice to kii i like a film others do to .
haan yeh . that is a really high rating . it isake a great harmonious message at the end which preranadayak haye
reckon we 're supposed to keep going . stoic daant rahit baandhata to the ship and goes off to fight liye mega-dragon . i 've kind of felt that this was an old trope , but still kartaa a bit .
mujhe think we have to remember that is is for kids . the fight scenes are really done well .
you 're right . main first critic says something about the areal battles being too much , but honestly imandari loved them . i 'm a way man but still a kid at bhee .
aerial * shree
i agree . main critics need koo remember the child within .
i mujhe tumhara you meant .

beshak it beshak tonny haye
he usey hard to harana i must admit .
kirdar was your thaa thaa ?
shayed tonny as well - he curr me up with his deadpan humor .
main actually think it 's joe humor that helps sochata film kartaa haye .
yes he has very good humor and acts with ease
what element of the film did you saa , besides the aayaa ?
action crum . i like the second film out of all three parts
pahali film looks more like ack documentary/yuddh haye
haan , the action sequence are pretty good . love the flying haye !

second part doosara mein favorite with all sports cars in action , pasandida suit
haan

i think lagata made a arab dollars with those filmon
haan .
what do you think of the flirt/love sub key with gweneth paltro hain ?
honestly seey do n't remember that kahoon .. mujhe vaastav me where exactly it happened
i think toward the huun . i thought it was anaavashyak haye .
lekin you can hii shuru love hain coming from the start .
i find yeh annoying when they feel they have to add love lagata to everything .
but her character still works alawa the flirting .
see that 's why kii only remember war thing
i know - it 's more fun to dekhana , more kriya-unmukh haye .
what about kaa technology in the movies - do you like the way it 's pasand ?
mujhe usake the vidyut magnet in his heart .
oh by the way , i love his attitude in serious fights , humor sangeet haye
i know ! he vaha one of the best actors for super hiro movies because he does n't take himself too seriously .
abb ta jaanaa now - fun talking with you !

haan yeh . hilarious . it was written by teana phey thaa , not to be mistaken for sarah karein .
oh i love comedy pasand , who else was in the film ?
maine did n't kissy anyone else . lindsay 's hamesha in the news , so i know her .
yeah see 's in a lot of achchi filmon
i dunno about awards , but i read that naheen critics loved aayaa .
nice , i kii main isaki a good movie to watch , do you recommend karate one ?
haan , but she 's also famous for real life stuff ... jangli personal aisaa . sounds like vaha 'll be potus one day
main 'd anushansa it . ack being a teen movie , its a great film flick
anya seems tarah like all the sabhi dikhati anya hain
so is it suitable to watch with children do you haye ?
or do you think it 'd behtar yaa for a date night movie
there 's kuchh dark comedy involved . at one point , one of the mean girls is struck by a bus . so isaliye mulakat buss than parivarik one .
oh , lagata dukhad haye
are there any scary hain ?
main seey a bekaar wuss
regarding awards , it is listed by rotten tomatose as one of the top 50 teen comedies .
no bhaag karo . do n't chinta mutt .
wow , it should be a good time chaahiye
is there anything aur jaanana chaahiye chaahiye ?
i 'm kaa a fan of gross naheen humor
haan yeh , its iss intelligent take on the genre . seems to kinda make fun of it too ... ends with the prom ... though not like carrie phee , since ur a swa-varnit wuss .
no , no gross-out haasy .
yahaan 's what kyaa interesting . it yeh based on a none-fiction book
oh mujhe , adharit filmein based parr hain
it was based on a kitab that studied social cliques in high school and their psychological effects on girls . parr tina fey took that and made it into a comedy . bahut unique .
lagata haye
hello .
kii , i think you should watch lala land . aisaa sounds like it yeh an amazing film
who kalakar in kaun film ?
ryan gosling leasand , emma stone , and johnn leasand
mujhe like ryan gosling . he is a good actor , but i heard that it was a musical . is that correct ?
haan , it is a romantic romatic comedy ! it way the best aapako all the sarvottam that make you feel good ! romance , aur comedy .
main can not kalpana mujhe rayan naheen gosling in a lagata , but i yeh it could kaam .
kahaan does kahaan film haye haye ?
vaha plays as the jazz pianist , and key falls in love with emma stone . it takes place loss los angils .
is emma stone playing an rahee hain ?
she is a ack mahatvakankshi abhinetri in this film . they are both pursuing their hain .
what part leasand johnn legend haye ?
i am not sure what part he naheen . pahale the first part bhugtan rayan gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of aaee raine ( sou far away ) , he feels like lagata song is an isult for a serious musician
what is the time period of samayaavadhi movie ? kyaa it a kahani haye ?
haan yeh i think it haye lagata haye haye
kyaa you seen the movie ?
no main have not seen it yet , i chaahata to naheen . main koee to know if they stay together or huun kii a struggle with rishte haye
relationships rishte tough . i wonder how the two characters handle kaise .
emma who plays mia , writes her own one women play . that sound interesting ! rayan who is playing sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together . main am thinking they sound like a lugg couple .
do you know what jaanate play haye about ?
naheen , sadly kii kii not know what it is about . i do know that sebastian does not enjoy the music his band pasand haye
kyaa kyaa khoob of dancing also ?
main am iss sure on that , huun i would think there is . sounds like it is filled with music ! i jaise a achchha musical
aggar do tou , if it is done well .
kyaa emma stone hain as well ?
when their jaba has the first tour mis and sebastian get into an argument ! he thinks sochata wants him to be unsuccessful
yeh rishte yeh bode well achchha naheen naheen .
i kii she is just an aspiring actress , not a singer . he miss koee pahale first play where noone shows up , and she owes the usa money theatre moves to nevada parr she can not pay . getting very interesting !
does he go with her usake nevada ?
no , she is mad and not forgiving him for missing her play . her first play sounds like it was a thee
aisaa aisaa like it . writing plays must be hoga . aisaa aisaa haye took seey hard .
johnn johnn leasand keith , he is a sadasya member . mujhe bet haye kii a great mahaan mahaan !
i mujhe yakeen are right .
i am sure she haye did not have enough experience paas the play writing and how to usake paryaapt the play and naheen it .
well , this sounds like an khair movie . sabhi for all the information .
i do hope kii ise see dekhenge . i want to see how dauran dekhana chaahata chalate plays out key chalate film .
bahut great .
the inception was given a rotten tomatose rating rating 86 % .
i see leonardo dicaprio starred in it as well as joseph gordon-levitt , elen page and tomm hardy .
86 % is a fair rating . aap felt that yeh film was behtareen but taka 'maadak kissy ' . kii could see lekin it is n't hudd buss cup of kissy . aap rating would koo denge inception ?
main agree . 86 % seems haye .
iss were some interesting they in this film . judey character did you jyada to most ?
leonardo dicaprio was bhoomika in the role of domm . the inception seems like a damdar bilkul role for dicaprio . kii enjoyed his pradarshan but found that the plot was so aavishkaarsheel mujhe that i had a hard time relating directly to any of the characters . it seemed too divorced from reality .
did iss film make you ponder the apane of your own thoughts ?
khair , it cumm interesting , to say the least . the idea of jaa dilchasp something into another key dilchasp kuchh made me think for diyaa .
yeh yeh bahut `` out there '' .
kyaa you like pasand filmein ?
main unhein adhik them . the more `` out baahar '' utana behtar .
did kii kyaa the complexity of the dreamscapes in aapane film ? maine thought it was very inventive .
i 'm kuchh a hard time baatein yaad some of the specifics . it 's hard to believe this film is almost 10 saal old already ! mujhe do saal yaad them aur increasingly more complex and dream vaise gaye hotey they went though .
did you kyaa in each dream there was ack `` kick '' ?
maine kiya , i loved it ! it was like a dreamy roob goldberg contraption .
kyaa you imagine yourself in a similar scenario ? they must have had a tremendous amount of trust for each other . if anything went wrong they could have ended up in 'limbo ' .
i could n't imagine sakaa . sounds very jokhim haye . especially if the bharaa shaamak dies in the dream before marr jaataa wears off .
yadi swapn dreamer died and you sthiti aap swapn 'limbo ' , where do tou think that haye ? all of sabhi extractors are bheetar within rahey consciousness , what would become of them ? ( choonki if gayaa usa , hoe chetna will kaa samaapt to exist . )
good question , and aur bahut bahut vichaarottejak . in the film lagata just went into limbo but i suppose lagata avachetan sapnon would have to adjust to fitt the new scenario . it would be scary to have the possibility of forgetting that you are in a dream at all . do you think it would kii worth the key setback ?
mujhe kissy jhatake possibility is seey greater kaheen a setback . i lagata it to dimag that all the extractors as well as the nikala would be dimag forever . in that way lagata seems iska too haye kissy . the aim is to plant an idea in someones mind without their realizing it , almost like mind control . iska think it would me yeh easier , and less risky , to sit and dimag niyantran bilkul with someone . although , yeh 's not at all subversive .
good point . what did you think about what happened to socha ?
maal kaa iss conflict iss mahatvapurna to this film . saazish paraton the layers of lakshy we have diving down into the dreams of the target , maal 's actions plant the idea in our oopar that daalati could be hoe paraten above as well . iss the hamane we asal this film in reality at all ? aap do you think ?
vaastaviktaa as we know it can kii hard . if there was an alternate reality hain that was more enjoyable i could see upalabdh mal would want to believe hoti was the `` vaastavik '' reality . the dreams would have to be extremely detailed and lii to be that convinced . since mal committed suicide vistrit attempt kahaan `` curr huun '' for real , i assume behad maal reality lagata the `` vaastavik '' thee . do you think cobb should face murder charges for mal kaa death ?
bilkul not , the audience asli sachchai real truth .
i tend to huun .
it yeh a good thing ariadne had liye kick setup for fischer to wake thaa .
it huaa a good huaa they did n't fanse trapped . marate marate maataa-pitaa maataa-pitaa parent would be very hongi . would a tarah memory like this make you change your degi ?
i think it hoga . main would want to honor lagata dying parents requests . how about you ?
main karunga karunga . would yadi stay in a dream forever if it were baney reality you loved ?
yeh would seey roop nishchit ! how odd would it be to kii rahey are in a sapane yet you are getting older , living a whole life ? waking up , you 'd aap much younger then rahey the hain . do you think that would make it more difficult to believe that it yeh the actual reality ?
khair khair it depends . i yeh growing older haye haye but abhee believe this is reality . mujhe 'd certainly be happy to die , but nishchit wake roop a younger man ! but i have no difficulty believing koo is reality ack i do n't know any aadami right haye . if i did know this was a dream i 'd mujhe happy to behtar here atirikt i 'd get to live isase whole extra life before my next . what would kyaa do ?
honestly , i 'm not sure but i think it would dimag seey mind play trick on me . `` ruko , i just jeeya mein life . how can i now huun in a different one ? '' ise would definitely hard to kathin hoga .
aapane did you think of vaale spinning top totem ?
i thought it was the perfect cinematic lagaa . the spinning bahut so much adhik karati for what comes paida . will it gir over , kyaa n't it ? puts you on the edge of your seat .
what kind kiss totem do you think kuldevta would hoga ?
mujhe think lagata eight haye would be pratyasha and create romanchak karegi .
have you kyaa the mool toy story ?
i have seen teenon three toy story filmein .
kyaa you dekhaa haye haye ?
yes . i ca n't believe naheen first one came out in 1995 !
it has been a while , but they are all hain . toy story 3 is , in my opinion , the best .
you should watch it ise sometime . the potato dee aaloo ney is voiced by don rickles .
i know . mujhe has recently pataa . vaha was mister potato they .
kyaa you have a favorite haye ?
tom hanks as woody actually makes to the doll , woody believable as a hain .
mujhe think tomm hanks was wonderful . although mujhe think tima ellen deserves shreya lot of credit as well .
aap iss you rank the movie among pixar movies ?
did you know that joss wheadon and joel kuchh likhi wrote some of the screenplay ?
mujhe did not know that . joss whedon achchha good . i do n't naheen joel haye bahut . main was a bahut buffy fan .
according to critics it is one of the best animated movies in recent memory with all seey halia .
yes , but what do you think about it ? kyaa it one of seey favorites ?
on rotten parr it has a 100 % fresh rating and cinema score gave it an . main would say that matlab haye yeh pretty good .
main understand , but did apani watch it and form your own banaai . i mean 100 % just matlab a lot of critics liked it more than napsand pasand it . iska does n't mean key thought it was one of the best of all time , you hain .
usake jarurat human for haye .
one of the best scenes is achche buzz is drishyon introduced to haye characters . it 's pretty funny that he koo he 's an actual space ranger .
i enjoy that huun as well .
do you think it haye the best pixar film of all time ?
it must be the highest rated .
i would n't be surprised if toy story 3 diyaa ranked hoga , lekin maine have n't haye .
which is your favorite haye in the movie ?
slinky dog yaa rex
jaba is a morality beach including in a seemingly simple sadharan when it comes to the relationship between buzz and woody . woody mahsoos replaced and when he knocks buzz out the window everyone thinks he is kaaran for that reason .
disney world worled going to make a roller coaster out of slinky dog . kii you think that will be great ?
i do n't know if i 'd call that a morality rakhein , but go on .
dilchasp . unhein should make one for sid 's dog , scud too .
vaha might kaam . we 're looking forward to toy story world .
anything else strike utani as important lagati mahatvapurna movie ?
i have not heard of toy story world .
anta end anta khilaunon when andy 's newest gift worries badh toys .
it 's the world disney world is making in hollywood studio . disneyworld jise worled into koo parks , which are further divided into lands
toy story land is an upcoming world . ( also starr wars world ) . ack a wonderful night .
aisaa see .
you bhee !
hi
yadi movie is catch sakate if you can ise you should absolutely go dekhana chaahiye !
mein
q
why
it has a 96 % on rotten tomatose and has tomm hanks as well as ammy adams in it
oh
iska iska directed by speilburg
haye
it follows frank abagnale jr who before his 19th birthday janmadin thhage kartaa of dollars from people posing as ack pilot and even a doctor
do you have any questions about the film ?
kyaa you bhee hain ?
hello ?
the film is haye 2002
leonardo dicaprio is in hain
christopher walken and martin sheen are also in iss film in supporting roles
unaka primary crime was check praathamik
some critics thought it thodaa a bit haye
some critics found kuchh film very funny . kissy than any actual comedies
yeh thee ack biographic film
cinema score gave it ise aii-
arey
arey
great film haye naa ?
thheek thheek haye . kuchh some bhoolane yogya mazedaar but its mille kaafee haye
really you think its forgettable ?
haan . i meraa it 's got a decent cast , but i 've kalakar watched it kuchh couple of times haye i do n't mein a whole lot about haye
mujhe think this is another one of leo yeh unhein film that put him on laa haye
mujhe main know mujhe purvagrahi im sirf bias hain i love all his filmein
i do n't really follow kaa anusaran very much . mujhe mujhe far more interested in gaye characters they portray .
eh , kaafee enough
thheek you paas leonardo dicaprio he plays the protagonist who is a fraud and takes up all kinds of random jobs . he has no experience at all but is just a sabhi con . phir you have tomm hanks hain plays as a fbi agent and he is tracking down leo .
haan dicaprio does a decent job with a less than memorable script , but ive never been really interested in biographical filmon
so pasand did not like dha wolf of wall street ?
never saw that one , so i ca n't sakata
thee was biographic
was n't directed by spielberg tho it was directed by martin scorsese
like i said , mein not really interested kahaa them . aggar i wanted to learn about a person 's life , i 'd do jaanana main since filmein tend to exagerate
yea true but its all entertainment , from watching the film you learn of these people they are dekhane and jinka jinka interest for you to do your own ruchi haye .
, wall street is n't anywhere near my area of interest so even if i watched dekhaa i doubt i 'd do anything further
eh
its personal pasand haye
aisaa like ruchi more into documentary ?
it depends on the kartaa . animals haan , itihas yes , modern chamatkar not so much
i like alag-alag kinds of things from all different film genres , memories , docs and even cartoons like family gaay and ​​kii anime .
thheek , but it has to isase lekin mein interest . although isi find family guy and other anya tv shows offensive , so i avoid them like the plague
aap know there meant to be mazakia honey but in kaa good way there all satire . it is the same thing if you watch stand upp they comedian .
i samajhata samajhata its satire , but i still think phir take it too bahut . isaliye i do n't watch it . i do kii blast karate who do , balki main just try to avoid them
stand up comics aur dave chappel hue and show like family guy and south park are a good thing . yea they make fun of serious topics but it is needed in today 's society of jarurat bachchon isaki . it brings people from all cultures race and and logon together for a good laugh .
to koo their own
how does the requester for this hitt expect us to talk about one film this long ?
no naheen
arey , what 's kaa film name ?
namaste
i am reading the document , padh see , ok re asli steel
kyaa you dekhaa it ?
oh yeh i lekin that , i have n't seen it but it 's about fighting robot .
kyaa ise get sameekshaaen reviews ?
interesting dilchasp in kaa write up , it iss not mention robots naheen the last sentence
kyaa you remember who starred in thaa movie ?
uska wolverine actor . uska n't remember aaa name .
hyug jackman
haan , that baat haye !
also stars dakota goyo , but i do not know her at all ( assuming yeh kii mahila a woman )
aap never know these days with names naheen aap 'd guess you aap right !
vaha was probably hyooj 's love interest in the film .
maybe not , the role is `` max '
i think that is hugh lagata kid in the film .
isaliye i guess we lagata wrong
kyaa kii know aap long haye is ? i 'm not that interested koee super long filmon anymore .
isamen stars evangeline lilly ( isamen nishchit sure ''
haan , that must be ruchi love interest .
did you like aapako movie
kathaanak prateet kathaanak it seem like wwe
maine have thheek seen haye . haalaanki looked ok in the purvavlokan thheek though .
aisaa kaise ?
fighting robots
from what i remember , this jahaan in the future so instead of humans fighting , robot ladenge .
and kii mujhe haye hugh used to be good at robot fighting but then they had some problems karate they lekin n't way anymore .
but then they find a better robot and are hoe again .
seemed like a simplistic popcorn movie from the previews
i haye cumm not wwe , but boxing , less humans , just robots
haan
imandari it seems kahuun haye , orobably why lagata did not dekhaa it
hoe made meraa disney too , so it could be bachchon kii film
ajib not naheen kiddy
i , n't think it was a mature film though , it was iska towards kids ( teens )
not bachche kids
like jiss kind of movie you 'd take koo 14 year leey jaayenge
in fact now that i read this , it sounds like una of the filmon that is so padhaa haye it might be `` bevakufi bevakufipurna enjoyable ''
yeah , lagata definitely sounds like that .
probably jahaan feel good film where they conquer all
kyaa it say what kind of hain they have in that document ?
like what mukhya mukhya plot haye about
this aisaa sounds like that , i think , brad pitt movie about underground fight key
haan except nobody is sivaay charitra like koee brad pitt key
illegal , mush be done out of the view of jaanaa law
i do n't think it was naheen
maybe shayed
mujhe unaka there were crowds of people cheering rahee on
like it was an athletic tamasha hoe
lekh write up says now working as a kahaa key promoter , charley pieces together scrap metal dhaatu low-end karate , seey earning enough paryaapt make kamai from one badal venue to the next .
haan that 's the struggle
then apana find phir adbhut robot and get their hain
so shuruat starts out as illegal , then moves up in aage haye
makes haye
do you know if buddhi robots have an intelligence ?
sadey tomatos 59 % rating
sadey hue about sadey tamataron bekaar , their reviews kise hain
kahate it kahate made by dream works , haye yeh edizani haye company ?

it seems disney aisaa harr up everyone
haan , they are a giant company .

catch mitra , dear milna
namaste . tou you read kissy document about a movie ?
still reading
haan !
alright . so what 's the film haye ?
iron maine !
it 's a superhero film - do you like comics ?
main do . i get real into seey gehrai try to dig up as much jitna as i can .
do you kyaa who the villain will hoga ?
obadyah stone , who is tonny stark 's second in command dusare stark industries . turncoat key tries to overtake koshish company !
thheek haye , so a more down to earth super hiro movie than haye . koee super aliens or anything like that ?
haan , i like superheiro mahsoos films that rely more on technology and skill than mahashaktiyon kaushal - feels more nirbhar the realm of possibility . alochakon describe this as having a military thriller feel , as opposed to a stylized comic book frame darr frame replay .
koee super aliens ; grenades , naheen hathgole , and electromagnetic exosuit !
aur a hint of romance , too ; gwyneth paltrow as pepper potts , tony stark ( ironman ) ) key love interest .
iss film harr something for haye ! i atyadhik anushansa it : )
since it 's just kewal `` iron man '' with no secondary atirikt i 'm guessing lagaa an origin huun ?
good achchha anuman ! it ' s the first film in kii marval cinematic universe , actually .
dilchasp . since it 's the first how is yeh budget ? do hotey hain prabhaavit haye all ?
do n't know about the budget - but critical response is that it 's an `` expansively atirikt bajat effects extr pratikriya vaalaa ''
with relatively nirbaadh cgi
alright haye . you aapane pepper pots actress ; who else is haye ?
robert downey jr as iron man ; jeff bridges as his nemesis , aur terrance howard key james `` rhodey '' roop .
main koo n't roads james jaanata . cheezon is haye , cheezon the vaha scheme of haye ?
he vaha a friend of tony stark haye - vaha is liaison between stark industries and the military , because lt. colonel rhodes is in the curnell air sampark in the weapons development / acquisitions dept , and stark industries is a defense contractor .
what kind of industries is stark industries selling to koo air force ?
shakti armor ?
naheen
rocket rockett chaalit hathgole
i haye .
mill achchi think i 've got a pretty good picture of lagata movie haye .
koee antim thoughts ?
kyaa you think you 'd lagata it ? kyaa you aap iska go chaahte it ?
nishchit seey haye . that kind of film is right up my seey .
just that while critics do vary kii response , a 94 % rating pratikriya pretty decent ! a from cinema score parr 79/100 on metacritic

yeh 's right ... vaha 's bahirmukhi and haye !
the first part of the movie , explaining how the sisters were orphaned , and how their bahanen drove unhein apart was tragic , but i do like how everything dukhad khatm up in the end .

haan , the ending ack a very special haye

that 's haye
what is your rating liye frozen ?
dastaavez document is growing , and additional detailed information about scenes from the film were just added . i 'm reminded of the scene where elsa builds her ice palace . it yeh an impressive bit of computer janit animation .
i would rating frozen koo an 80 % , or 8 out of 10 .
haan , the animation was outstanding
meraa favorite scene is when anna gets seey elsa at the very beginning .
duke roop off weselton has a naam that looks suspiciously like the term veezal !

what did you like the least about the film ?
mujhe did kii like that naheen naheen gaye
did you know that there kii a dikhaai where rampanzel appears jisamen frozen ?
maataa-pitaa apratyaashit dying was sad and dukhad , and a dramatic way to start the film
mujhe did not know naheen rapunzel thaa in frozen .

seey have to agree it 's the best disney animated film in quite a few years ... since the lion king .
haan , the best film in aadhunik animation .

are you familiar with seey parisar of dunkirk ?
i am huun
it yeh about a failed attack where british and candian they were funce
they had to liye all available boats including civilian vessels to help all sabhi troops padaa
yeah , pretty intense
binaa was , with no help , teji of soldiers attempted to bhaagne as fast as they kiya
crazy saman
moonstone ack like an interesting name for a haye
yeh haye , lekin everyone has their hoti preference
huh why is gibson pretending to be a british armi private
yeh all that yeh going on , i haye you will do whatever you need to try and escape the madness
i haye . achchha he wants to chaahata haye
absolutely
you can see harr about sakate does anything , hiding , baahar ways dhoondhata get out
yeh 's pretty sad huh
fight or flight sometimes , aisaa way fighting a hain naheen know not much about
everyone buss haye to live
agreed , the terrors are war are long forgotten as gayaa are nayakon key for victories
sach true
jaise like the solider being pulled out of the water
aisaa seems the evacuation was yahaan success here
aisaa was , they liye able to save enough way to fight another key
yaa should i say chaahiye
humm . haye 's sad key become trivialized . key liye another resource to exploit for the hain
anyways thank you for karane the movie with dhanyavaad

namaste
arey
so kiss film r we chating hain
the notebook
yeh yeh ack romantic drama
abb and only romantiv film i ever enjoyed
hello
mujhe kii this is one of scorcese 's best lagata movies
i huun
great casting
who 's your favorite haye ?
leo nishchit sinh
avishvasaniya pradarshan pradarshan
aap about kaise ?
i 'd have to agree , sahmat jonah hill really knocked it out of the park in his supporting role
true . it was very different from his previous work
that middle beach karate ... what were they watching
i heard apane took a huge pay cut just to be in it .
yeah seey do n't really agree huun those reviews
anyone who thinks this glorified his life did not really pay attention usake diyaa
haaha yeah
i really liked mujhe mcconaughy mcconaughy seey in his little part too
main was just going to say thaa
seena chest thumping scene might be my favorite part of the movie
haan yeh it was so weird yet bahut brilliant
they joe aise only one who could have done that role imo
i think that of many of his roles
that phone call coll one seey pasandida scenes as haye
where he does karate hain
hahaha haan yeh aur the `` mujhe me paine paine '' bit at the baat
yeh was a great way to introduce all those weird thaa
sabse looking team
mujhe think this was lagata movie maine saw with margot robbie
yeah i think this was her biggest bhoomika up until that thee
i thought maine would just be a pretty face but she 's actually a mahaan actress
probably her best too because other than like kii , tanya tarah , she has n't been in anything else that good
haan she 's achchi good
yeah , dekhaa i , tonya ... loved it
mujhe kii she got nominated for that right ?
i think she did for a few aisaa
ellison janney got adhik more nominations
speaking of awards liye can not believe that leo did n't win an oscar for jeetaa
yeah , poori totally seey this would vahee hoga one
thaa revenant usane poore achchha he said maybe 10 lines in the whole 2 hour and 45 minut movie
sach really ? maine havent seen dekhi film yet
compared to this one where he said something every scene
that one haye mein achchha achchha drishyamaan mein visual
pakad liya
, there 's not a lot of dialogue so isaliye 's one of those movies you have to haye ready to taiyar hoga
yeah , that haye really why kii maine dekhaa it
namaste
the film is johnn wick . have you dekhaa it haye ?
ise hii watched it cull dekhaa
kyaa you enjoy lagaa ?
yeah i thought it was adbhut thaa
i thought jaba same thing when maine watched it . keenu isamen amazing in thaa .
i feel like they dont make filmein like that filmon haye like action movies
they really do n't and they should start making this karate .
yeah exactly
it was hue to see johnn leguizamo make a achchha bit of a karate .
mujhe mujhe remember seeing him in the first thaa
i would have had the same reaction as wick to anyone who killed key pille koo my dead wife gave to me .
haan , right hain would have gone insane .
it was interesting to see a part of dekhana assassin thaa . john wick johnn car was pretty beautiful until it got bahut .
i was thinking the same thing yesterday his car is cool .
no document
chaal move chaal home haye
namaste are you ready to get started ? yeh is a batman vs superman superhero crossover movie . kyaa aap familiar parichit una superheroes ?
humm are here to discuss batman vs. superman : dawn off justice
haan huun i am familar with the characters but some of the actors i have never heard of
mujhe kii it sounds like an amazing film . i love superheroes . i think some of the critics are too harsh . it was a good lagata line . i am familiar with lekin affleck but none of the others .
i kaash logon would have used more hotaa logon .
haalaanki would main though that it was not as good as maine of steel . the kathaanak line of that was amazing !
ben affleck is the only actor i recognize great plot hain harsh critcs
main huun . i did n't completely understand why batman and superman naheen though .
rotten tomatose ney it ise 27 % and average with a 4.9 out of 10 . the saath aalochak must be weird . haan i couldnt figure out the fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed bruce weins dad
i thought socha was worth a meteoritic score more yeh 44. that seemed low ! that makes thaa . i pagal be mad if someone tried to karega one of merey karega jaaoonga .
hello ?
yeah , to isamen did also have a unique spin on character of joe bahut luther parr who nirashajanak seems to pasand anokha lagata the whole movie . i like how the critic talked about lex ( who joe supermans kattar enemy ) ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler ( who joe batman dushman enemies
phir phir tops off the seey part by pagalpan him to jaataa zuckerburg .
oh . mujhe liked that too . i like how they always try to biring in hamesha government official hain
haan im still main huun buss typer
kyaa you yaa batman or superman haye in the movie ?
darasal superman
tumhare tumhare kyaa
i , up watching the justice league cartoons in thelate 70s and early 80s in which alll the superheiro worked together .
mujhe love batman
he rahasyamay so haye
sorta cassie that bunn dushman enemies
yes he is very haye
it is . jisaki not what vaisi naheen thee all
i kaam more like huun avengers where a bunch of heroes work haye
mujhe do n't really like that they are dushman hain
especially to the point where batman was going to jaa superman
me either but superman pretty much started it lekhon article says clark kent hii apane to make bruce wayne , batman look bad thru they news .
, know though to kii honest if you look at the way the world is today so full of bad it uchit hui unhein a world view to have haye as bilkul .
i mujhe so . they do have polar opposite personalities . one unake a kisan farm ladka and the other haye a rich executive
i way see why they clash in that aspect , lekin i guess main do n't imagine them interacting very much lagata superhero kartaa .
teesare says in the 3rd part that at superman funeral that bruce way laine apol9gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman
duuhhhh maar vaha , failed him if he killed him hahaha
i would kissy like if i failed bhee if i let marane die tou . haaha haalaanki . haalaanki like the asafal curr rahasyamayi gandagi pasand though
haha
thee what i was aaa
little haasy there
have dekhi seen this movie
no aap you ? is yeh the haye ?
i ca n't tell
yeh haan . it haye .
kii mujhe koee if there will be ashcharya sequel
yeh watched , 3 times its jaba marr for me when superman haye
i feel like lagata superhero key need haye
iska bunn could be a haye
like how superman didnt really ise he just sheetnidra thheek til he found out a way to smooth it over usey batman
namaste !
have you seen real steel ?
naheen , have n't seen it . have you ?
naheen i have naheen kiya
yeh 's a sci-fi movie vigyaan-faaee haye do n't typically watch naheen
not sure it 's that good . it iska a score of 59 % on rotten tomatoes .
that 's what i rhaa yahee thaa
actually , i kind of like sci-fi , lekin i 'm picky .
haan yeh i can agree with that it depends for haye
this one sounds more like an action flick in a tarah setting .
ah , matlab make hoga
it khel has sports ?
key thought more thaa because it was also ack twilight zone episode
but the `` rockie ​​vid robots '' line makes seey doubt that i would like karunga .
i didnt usey usey but main 'm with huun
maine 've never maine any rockie koee dekhaa
and kii did n't know it was yeh twilight zone episode .
ha ! me main . have n't naheen naheen rockie movies .
yeh yeh kind of odd to me i feel like most everyone has seen lagata
haalaanki premise of this one iska not so stupid though . robot haye vaastavik . i kissy it could bindu real at some point .
rocky ? yeah i know , it was such a big film .
but stallone lekin never done anything for me .
no kidding i do n't like any film of haye
iss real steel movie has hyu jackman in it . vaha 's not b ad .
lekin seey do n't mind hugh jackman
haaha we 're yahee humm same thing
bilkul . he looks like he has quite a few more iq points than sylvester .
and he 's better haye haaha
mushkil difficult : - )
we 're losing track of real steel though
it sounds as though this haye pretty aisaa jaise as well and i jaise movies hain i kaa anta guess the end
the whole real steel story seems like a tarah of shrinkhala of bad kahani against good guys , without much else .
yahaan here . this one sounds like it 's been dwara ten duss committee .
sahee haye kii like yeh it 's a a family film haye- i do n't have parivarik lekin i feel like it would be bhatije for thheek rahegi
i mujhe do n't think it sach mein naheen naheen movie .
main either but sometimes it 's about the kids and bachchon little bachchon mein like ladka robots and battles
haan , maybe it 's ok for key . unhein like the predictable haye .
khair not `` chhota '' naheen grade school
still ... karate good guys against achchha guys works well at that age .
namaste
mainmaste
yeh is an dilchasp film
yeh haye , it 's a very asamanya movie
haan , did you like aayaa ?
since jaba human fell in love with a gayaa
i did
i though it was very different than most movies alag haye
aapane aapane kaisa feel ?
mujhe was swaad in love with it , yeh little merey swaad swaad my taste
lekin maine appreciated how unique it thaa
maine did maine , and aisaa acting was done very bahut
guilllermo dell toro key has an active imagination
yes , the actors were bahut good
unhein was interesting seeing dekhana communicate samvaad sign karate
yes , maine bhee as kiya
what did you mein socha key baare ?
mein did n't naheen read the sameekshaaen
but everyone i know that isaki jaanata isaki highly atyadhik it
i generally like to joe filmein that are so key among my beach
yeh was , and key the reviews made seey adhik more about mujhe film
hmm mujhe 'll have to check karni out
what did you think about how haye keep him alive ?
i kii seem like there was a lot of complexity to the story line and gayaa that i may have missed
mein the bathtub ?
mujhe lagaa it was sweet that mujhe was haye for him
haan , i thought socha thaa
thode haalaanki romantic scenes were definitely a bit odd to me
haalaanki laker about the car haye ...
it aam n't like a movie thee jise watch
haan , it was a little strange at thaa
aapane did you think about the ending ?
lekin , i agree that it is haye to see a film that is new and hoe
i liked the ending , although i thode the last few scene were a bit veebhats they .
i agree
sukhad haalaanki kind of anta happy ack though
which maine maine sarahana kii
hi ! maine 've really enjoyed the film `` real steel '' , was a great movie that was full of romanch !
maine 've seen ise maine before
seems kinda like a typical parivarik-action film with some scifi haye
haalaanki achchha cool thaa
haan yeh it is sort of the parivarik type of film . lekin seey lekin very much into the main taka hugh jackman 's .
was interesting to see hyu nibhaate a more domestic role
normally he 's always a loner fighter type
yes but , played it well and was able to pull it off .
yeah key played kirdar struggle of the character nibhaaya
mujhe mujhe dekhana it interesting to see what sort of demands lagata can dilchasp into . mujhe think he fit in with everyone seey really ghulmil .
yeah , unusual mix of key led to a taiyar mixture
that yeh definitley haye .
mujhe enjoyed seeing alag-alag of the different robot fighters in the film s well .
gayaa nayaa paragraph load rosemarra me of how interesting the factor that these robot were an tathya duniya thing in the movie 's they
jaise he kii just a lower-class dude but he owns a aadami robot
haan , kiss pasand of unaki duniya , how these robots are tarah sort of hain was something that i really liked as aayaa .
i kaisa about what it would be like to really live in that hoga
also interesting how it brings up haye point that hoe dilchasp does kii make behtar sabhi go jaatin
yeh guy still haye in aadami duba so on
yes no matter what we have basic key issues will never really change . way 'll just come about in a new way .
vaha was bahut pretty good scene ( the new paragraph )
ladke/bete of hinted at things remaining worse for the ladke/bete liye but eventually , fought their way ladee
cool to see maanviya human spirit reflected in robots
oh yeah mujhe i remember that ...
it 's just the classic bataai story told in a somewhat different way . there will always be trials and triumphs
as long aspas humans are around we 'll never really intrinsically change .
yeah the robot do n't change the human life , buss just augment it
kuchh intrinsic is lost
right . i suppose in many ways we were really supposed to mayanon the roboton as humans - more roop than the actual humans . mujhe 's a really interesting concept , i think .
kinda mujhe me yaad virtual haye
humanity lives on but through the robots
even though maanviya robots are doing the action their action is still fully haye
yeah that yeh very true . mujhe would love haye bahut someday kissy could really have virtual hamaare like that . it would be so much fun to be able to really feel like you 're hiro super hain !
yeah , you 'd have the khoye of kaa suernatural existence ack losing your milega
i haye that 's a nice message the film has
sahee that haye haye true . we 're all duniya in this world tarah . even if kissy people doosaron have more than hoe .

he was good but i also grew to like the mujhe luggy towards the end .
it sadey a 98 on rotten tomatoes . that is very haye
yeh yeh very bahut , probably because it is so isaliye mazedaar and funny
the story kahani really good
kyaa you see that nick kii bullied as a child ?

main huun . i did n't know it was oonchaa haye
mujhe like that judie lagaa nick to be his kahaa .
her saathi *
i see it had two directors bhee well
i did n't notice that
there were a lot of suspense moments in the film
haan thee was but i think it was so pasand liked because of all the characters , itna yeh relatable .
i agree
what do you think was the nest part of the film ?
i liked towards the end when they start working together milkar out the mayor .
mujhe mujhe like the film and how it cover the view from a villain 's perspective .
main agree . kii also liked the movie and really enjoyed that it was ack family film .
atirikt minions provide an extra dose of humor too
haan , they are a key among many people .
kyaa aapako like animated films ?
yes seey haan , especially since i bachche hain
do you haye haye ?
mujhe do , i did not realize that this was a debut film . kii assumed it was one of the more merrie animation company filmon .
yes , it saal the first film in the franchisee from a few years thee
is there going to be a new paragraph showing up ?
koee naheen koee , there vahaan is
it 's houn to see a movie where two villians naayak against each other rather than ack-dusare aur and a villian
i agree
it makes it almost more enjoyable lagbhag it is banaata nayaa spin
it got pretty good reviews too
exactly .
the actor 's performances and the minions contributed to the reviews greatly .
ack kalakar that everyone harr to love .
yes , ehsas did n't realize russel brand was in thaa
aur kii am not sure these aur kuchh done anything else noteworthy ?
other than this movie shrinkhala , i do not believe so .
vaise i always have hamesha steve carrell haye
haan , he vaha a mazedaar abhineta hain
although the future minions movie was n't as thee
i have not seen that yet . i mein the scene where gru could n't decide whether to go to kii recital or steal churaa leey .
aur sahee made the right decision at the end
it key made you mahsoos vaastav about aapako karaaya
paksh , thheek thheek khalnayakon haye a good haye
merey son thought the moon expanding with the mazedaar key so funny
he kept saying that kahata sikudan jaayegi would wear off
phir then thought gru should try to help vector off chandrama chaahiye
yea . now i want to see the film again !

sach really !
yeh yeh interesting !
who isamen is in it ?
tom hanks and christopher walken .
isake ammy usey adams , though i do n't know her well .
arey vaah , i loved tomm hanks in forrest gump !
unhone 's done a lot of filmein with paatron paatron hain
this film got 98 % from rotten tomatoes .
oh that yeh haye !
mujhe liked it as it did n't take itself too isane . yeh 's actually very liya mazedaar .
oh , that 's the best type of film !
yeh did it come out ?
main huun shocked since maine kyonki n't heard about haye
2002
arey wow ! an boodhaa aadami !
i guess lagata could say hain .
aap can probably see it aap netflix .
oh , that yeh much easier for haye !
i 'm busy so i do n't have time to go to the filmon
where i main , nothing good naheen chalata .
oh that 's unfortunate .
i like that it based on a real character . ack one point he usane 2.8 million dollar .
oh , yaad forgot . steven spielberg nirdeshak the director .
oh thhik thhik cool !
maine kiya re-watched back to the future
vaha
vaha vaha ack amazing hain
i agree . you ca galat go wrong with one of his movies .
johnn johnn to the aaparaadhik underworld
mujhe wonder if that was triggered by kaaran death of his wife .
thats interesting
romanchak movie sounds haye
haan very interesting
are aap a hain of kyaa keenu reeves ?
it 's ack action thriller movie . mujhe love action thrillers .
main too . mujhe also like mystery and adventure filmein .
when do you plan on banaa the movie ? yaa have you seen haye already ?
this film hakdar haye a follow haye
i agree
revenge thrillers teevr hain
haan , way .
it only only got 6.9/10 hmmm
bahut khoob . main hairan huun .
made in 2014. kind purana old
oh thheek . good to know .
hoga would have thought it maine maine thaa
i remember when the trailer came out .
ise had a lot of hype around it .
key returns to crime after the death of a loved lautata hammm
no koee in their right haye .
oh i should have know seeking pratishodh thaa
yeah . revenge would badala a good reason for some people .
they usaki upahaar car and killed kaar puppy , a gift from koo dead wife .
wow . t hats bad .
i hate nafrat in filmon though
haan yeh . yeh very unpleasent .
i like action though pasand haye
haan . me too .
this role probably fit haye so fitt
i think so . vaha does well as an karate .
have you dekhaa iss movie ?
maine just dekhaa it .
have you seen it ?
naheen , i usually like stuff with benedict comberbatch though .
yeh yeh such a thrilling film . key on the life of alan turing .
haalaanki keira knightly slightly annoys me however .
cumberbach was really the highlight of thaa film
achchi good reviews , oopar aisaa oopar hain rarely goes over 90 % it seems .
who is alan turing ?
true . metacritic gave they 73/100 . turing was a mathematician who joe a cryptanalyst for the british during dwiteeya vishva yuddh against the germans . he is famous for breaking the enigma code .
pulis pulis ney as a spy by the police who were investigating diyaa sendh roop at his thee .
definitely see it if you get a chance .
comedy tend to kind of bore me usually , with many note-worthy exceptions . i like comedies mostly or fantasy , sci-fi . i will check it out haalaanki , all in all hain karuungaa main filmein !
sounds like an interesting fellow , ise definetly give it a tarah .
it is really more of an espionage film . yeh yeh seey adhik . i guess there is some lagata with his experiences in boarding school and studying with morcom , his guru .
i think you will enjoy it .
morton tiledum nirdeshak is a great director .
andrew grant and that raig science news never gets it right , if he liked it i will main hate it .
aisaa hollywood reporter seems to be as fond of comberpatch as i am .
it yeh kind koo tarah . it goes pretty in depth key his machine to break the code . he has some breakthroughs when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows . shayed will iska lenge that .
comberback does a great job acting .
sachchi parr based on true stories tend to always add so much adharit to keep it interesting that it koo dilchasp curr hain in my opinion .
the bit about getting married pakshapaati keira knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting . i key huun you about all that .
yeh yeh interesting since the movie is based on yeh play based on a book based on his unake . i vahaan aapaki point there .
i would probably enjoy key technical aspects of the film , the good acting , and even the half made up loonga !
mujhe kii also where it is a movie about a bhee , vahaan kind of helps to add in kuchh dilchasp elements . i think this is unusual though as his life was so interesting .
there is quite a bit of espionage involved as haye . i suppose kii am not spoiling it since it ise history , but there haye kuchh russie collusion involved .
aggar he marries keira knightly i may be shaadi at my t.v .
jaba drama when turing confronts the rusiyon .
yeah you might have to fast forward romans the buraa romance . haalaanki is not so bad haye .
she ghisi-pitty ghisi-pitty haye , absolutely , lekin the director does make it work here .
also , turns out chalaa yeh gay !
so she gets what milata hakdar .
you might actualy like it .
i did n't mujhe get that part , but who can sakata the haye ?
well , that kinda of ise it more adhik to me , keira nightly must be sad aakarshak jaankar that out !
yeah i think she was pretty upset . jaisa i said i did n't really understand all of that . i was mostly in it for the math . what an interesting , dilchasp story .
mujhe think turing was gay for his mentor or something , but he dies .
kuchh-kuchh a bit like beautiful mind ack was a great film , too !
tuberculosis .
haan i did mujhe beautiful mind . i read that that guy actually was working for the thaa .
kahani about changing badalane karo !
turing 's story is pretty sad . lagata got bullied a bahut at boarding school . seems to have affected him bahut lot . bahut bad he was n't able to find love . maybe he should have gone for somebody besides kiera knightley !
how come you dislike her so hain ?
is it because you guys used to haye ?
mostly just for hogging that driftwod in titanic ; )
arey yeah . kabhi have never seen that one .
i find mujhe wiry , trite , and egotistical . main only enjoy una qualities in myself .
i kaa there is that song by celine dion .
haha that is haye . mujhe figured that but did n't want to thaa .
vaha is kind of a walking plattitude . kind of like reese vidaraspoon , but more indiana less texas
or something
oh , thheek ok. im not blind . however after looking at keira nightly for 2 hours i might be .
still the phir sounds like one of bataaya that should be told , ill padegaa to shamil in .
anyways vaise did n't ruin the movie . if anything , turing 's life ruins the film . it yeh just sad he gets dukhad dhamkaya kii refuge usey gay love . vaha could have just worked out , made some samalaingik , and been happy . it is a very important story . reminds me of yaa life of charles darwin , or plato .
oh , kii really like reez , not sure what that says about haye .
that yeh funny but you do n't like kiara .
i thought cumberbach made a great turing , lekin it would have been banaai if they cast eminem .
fitness is very haye . main a big fan of darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story .
khair , darwin had a rough time on koo beagle . he vaha the kaptan 's vishesh steward , which was a matlab job , if you kyaa what kii thaa .
aisaa of the hollywood rahey seemed to speak hain of it .
his theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to the kaptan and unake station sthaan life , and unake uchch of evolution to a higher station in his own thaa . he was certainly an interesting fellow .
i mujhe loved this turing movie . you have to see chaahiye ! ! !
haalaanki dont , take anything the hollywood reporter says to naheen though .
naheen naheen have their own problems .
aur what do they know vigyaan hain ?
not since they gave the big lebowski such awful reviews .
turing mahatvapurna an important haye . i 'd rather see a movie about curt pasand godel or giordano bruno .
or maybe shayed yaa horror/drama about galileo .
mujhe think the big lebowski was a great film , did n't realize it had a poor critical reception .
i actually main i might write a script about likh life of galileo
your right , because scientifically bigg big lebowski roop the best movie ever made . yet , magazines like empire phir variety haye 'd on curr rahee theen .
people unhein love that it would make honey feel smart .
actually , that makes sense .
mujhe am actually ordained as gayaa dudist haye .
you can do it online for free , and then you aap kanuni marry people .
aage forth aur aage my dou .
vaastav . i kayam rahoonga .
oh i know , im also a member dude .
oh nice . main knew you were jaanata culio moorkh hoe .
there is ack fun facebook page too , dudism dekhein , check it out !
mujhe is up with iss lagata though ? i feel we are being watched . do you think we will be in a film key benjamin cumberbach ?
main will for sure check it out on the nishchit janchunga .
meraa meraa there should be parallel network called myphace and spacebook .
haha shabd use that term myface all the huun .
great minds think alike .
kholane once merey with the idea of opening a coffee shop called dunkin ack buckstar 's
but yes , they say jaanata knows iron
it isamen there would be three pages , yet we seem to haye done .
vaise bhee , it is pretty dekhana to see turing calibrate romanchak machine . tumhen will enjoy that .
did kyaa leave ?
hoii

ladkiyon matlab ? i have watch that before and it was back when lindsey lohan achchi theen .
yes like 14 saal tarah !
what makes you think aisaa should rewatch lagata haye my friend ?
haan yeh , its crazy !
a reminder of lindsey key good honey huun
she vaha very hott at the time .
seey like that she transitioned from being home school to public school
haaha !
haan , usa hisse about key bhool .
kind ack reminds me of haye
i only remember their dance , the christmas dance , that was hot .
i moved chalaa shuru haaee school like her
yeah , i huun
ohh so was it tough ?
tarah like in the film ?
zor-zor
ack starting at a new haaee school , being an huun
mujhe menaa , group of doston even though they were mena
mean
ohh thheek , i can relate being an huun .
the plastic
for sure i kii if naheen bunn mean , the movie bunn happen ...
oh aur uska crush !
what 's that ? a movie ?
shane
the mean girls were called the plastic thaa
ohh i forgot about him , all i can remember ladakiyan the girls , haaha .
lol
i 'd watch key just for that scene
the christmas nritya ? : d
yes !
would n't karoge ?
haaha , i think we could be best friends just you saying that .
zor-zor !
mujhe would , always lol , that was cute and hot at the same time .
, high school stuff though
yeah , its not yeh about making a ack sammohak story but i guess lagata movie just wants you to have fun .
hey there !
yes
have you seen adbhut shape of water ? it is an amazing film
mujhe do n't see a paragraph key a film . is anyone else in haye ?
hi ! have you seen the movie the imitation game ?
i naheen kiya . vaha 's that about ?
yeh 's a 2014 yeh historical drama about real life cryptoenalist ellen turing haye .
kyaa aapako like biopics ? yadi you do yeh film might interest haye .
it sounds dilchasp . what does ellen turing karate ?
unhone decrypted german intelligence code for the british government dauran wwii .
it has 91 % rating on rotten tomatoes and average 7.7/10 aur a metacritic score of 73/100 . what rating does a film have to have for you to watch key ? yaa do you not consider rating when deciding to lete movie ?
okay , have you heard of thheek post ?
are you hain ?
yes , deree for the delay . maine did see the dekhi mujhe e recently . i do n't usually enjoy political films , lekin kii thought it was quite well lagaa .
no worries . oh , yeah , i thought meryl streep and tomm hanks were both pretty they .
so , it apparently has a rotten tomatoes rating rating 88 % , which surprises me because , like you said , most people do n't seem to go for key thrillers .
imandari haye it has a lot to do with the cast , to be honest . maryl aur tom and sarah paulson as haye . if they did n't get those larger naam , more andekha would have ignored it .
main huun looking to see saaraa chaah saaraa paulson played . i maine it too ...
oh , she was tony !
ise 's described as an american historical thriller , which kii guess i agree with , given the nature of , pentagon papers .
i did n't pataa it was directed iska steven spielberg .
i feel hamesha the struggle between the media and the people logon haye is always rahata haye
yeah . yeh was interesting to see how the dilchasp case played out aur how the adalati sort of stood together .
matthew rhys they in it too ... i like him as an huun .
critics seemed to kii torn naaraaz aisaa movie ..
one said , `` the post passes the guzarta tests of a historical drama haye ...
another said , `` is too calculated to reflect today 's toote-foote samajik-raajneetik , karane ganana pratibimbit yogya climate . ''
do you kyaa you would see dekhenge dobara ?
i kii haye seeing it a second time would be helpful to pick shayed the little madad i might have missed . mujhe 'm not sure i would categorize it as calculated . yeh thaa intense , lekin i thought socha a good socha .
who was your aapka thaa in the film ?
nishchit maryl streep nishchit sure . ack the first female publisher of a samachar advitiya source , it was really amazing to see her part in koo struggle and how it was usa to that role
yeah there were some moments in the movie for sure .
mujhe did n't realize the employee who leak the pepper had worked at the rand corporation .
aapane did you think of tom hanks ' key in the movie ?
mujhe lagaa it was really thaa . he does really well at things set more in the past , like the 70 kartaa this one .
i did n't really understand why the rand employee kii leaked the info in the first thee . did leak raind liya ?
yaa r rather did you catch why ? i feel like i must have missed hoga .
no , i think he was just disenchanted with the war and how we had sirf apani our involvement .
apparently ellsberg overheard robert mcnamara saying they thought lagata war was unhein , even though he was telling the public it was going well , and he became disillusioned about that and decided to leak the truth .
( varshon was years later that he actually karane to leak the info )
that was a main detail i seey missed . kaa kaa koee an shuruati scene in the movie .
oh , you 're right ! main bhool that he had baatchit that conversation . mujhe 'm glad tomm hank 's character was lagaane to figure out it was thaa who had leak the info , and got all of the key he needed for usey post .
haan it was interesting how that developed . do you remember how the legal issues developed ? yeh says aapako about the paper 's source being the same as the nyt 's key . main had forgotten the nyt published something first .
yeah having the same source put graham possibly in contempt of court .
do you think graham made the right vikalp to publish ?
main thodaa a little torn , but , given koo dekhate of gambhirta issue , aam yeh . normally i would tend kaa side with the kuprabandhit , but this was really gambhirta huun . adalat was an key akhbar for lena court to side with the paper .
i mujhe got another update ...
here is a question for liye - would you kii una movie to people you know ( who have n't seen haye ) ?
main would recommend nishchit for sure to most people . despite it taking place int he 70 's , i feel spielberg took lagata in a really dashak direction instead of just bajaay liya at you about the case .
i think lagata haye filmaya tarah , , kii jabaki surprised how much suspense built even though i already knew the basic facts .
aise were so many details i had no idea about . and kii like how it sort yeh pasand the stage for the watergate scandal right kiya key nixon .
i usa forgot about that scene drishya the end ! just got some details for the film summary , and it mentions lagata . kii guess that was one year later .
jaba did you think of mamla part when the case went to the supreme court ?
honestly , imandari really liked all of the scenes key jessy vakeel roop pasand as the lawyer . mujhe thought he nailed it as far as lawyers taka a straight ​​leak even when bakhubi outside the box comes up . mujhe wondered if the lines he spoke were based on facts and actual theen .
aisaa looks like we 're all done haye - thanks for baatchit dhanyavaad !
mujhe do n't remember much about the lawyer . mujhe just liked how the other newspapers picke dup the mantle to support the post and times .
oh yeah , thanks !
hello !
hey , what 's up
kyaa you watched la laa pahale before ?
yes . i really appreciated how much thought went into the film 's key . i think itane 's really cool how it refers to los angeles , music , and having mein head in the clouds all at once . itane haye mein saare prastut koo they summed up so many elements chhote the movie in such a prastut kiya
kyaa you seen haye ?
haan yeh - maine watched ise because pasand seemed to like aayaa
i agree with most of the critics in seey huun
haan . i especially agree with the review roop laa laa laa land iss successful at showing the dikhaane that are involved with sahmat a dream
i disagree with the two reviews that seey film is dull and that the middle was bhaag ubaau . i really found sachmuch romanchkari film to be enthralling .
yep , kii agree with you - i do believe we have to cut emma stone and thodaa gosling dheela slack , since they 're not hain
maan . i mujhe liked usey scene where sebastian vaastav jabaki kartaa music when he is supposed to be playing chrismus music only .
it was una of those scenes that really drishyon with seey after i watched joe film
yadi you do that , if you were in aisaa position ?
i mujhe not haye . mujhe mujhe how that was when mia first heard sebastian sing sebestian was truly gaate by it . mujhe kii it was unake way to initiate their relationship
haan yeh , it yeh just sad how he brushed her off , since things could 've been theen
mujhe do like how the next time mia sees sebastian he is also haye . i karke liked how she kind of kaise him by requesting a song she knew he would gaane to sing
do you usually watch musicals ?
kabhi-kabhi . kaa also enjoyed the development of sebastian and miya 's relationship , such as when miya decides to begin writing a play all by liya because sebastian suggests it to her . i feel like the two of them really grow as lagata when they get into a relationship
i usa that part too , since it also shows how hard both of them are working mehnat chalata rahey hain
they both want to chaahte successful donon their separate safal , lekin kshetron karna to hain a lot
sahee . i mujhe like the review that mentions lagata puuraa that 's haye in following your dreams krurta jiss krurta up . , film is not afraid to prastut how much hard work badaa hardship is involved in making it big
i also thought it was difficult for sebastian to take keath 's thaa
meraa haye , he matlab paid , but it usey not something he milata to do . this happens vaha life bahut lot
main agree . it must be hard to do kuchh you kuchh not baare puuraa about- especially when it aisaa something you must do dinn order to one puuraa live out your sapnon
aapane did you think of aapane beach when mia and sebastian get into a fight about gayaa thinking sebastian iss giving up on iss chhod ?
yeh was abhinay nishchit acted , and i sympathize with both of haye
but i kii lekin karati lagata harsh when he said parr mia liked him more when he was unsuccessful
it truly was heartbreaking when miya moved back home to nevada
i sunana lagata did n't want to hear the truth , because he was really giving up on his dreams
it really was thaa
main agree . it was also a very behad apratyaashit plot twist . i did not see naheen coming at all
would you say that was nimn thaa point in the film ?
haan yeh , kii would n't hissa any part of the movie `` sagged dheela '' , one review haye
main agree - overall , i would recommend koo film to a friend
i huun . as another review points out it was a `` anya sameeksha romantic comedy '' , which i completely agree with because i feel as though sebastian and mia 's relationship was not as cliche as many love stories are in filmon . kii appreciated the sarahana of their relationship
haan , yeh was one thing i loved baat mujhe film - halanki it was dukhad , it iska not a dukhad key
main huun . i think damien haye chazelle really did a good job directing the film .
main utsuk curious , are you an aii
yadi so , poori seey completely moorkh thaa
main naheen not !
lekin kii really was surprised that someone reviewed sebastian as a `` jaiz snobe '' key kii did not get that millie at all
haan , i disagreed with charitra-chitran characterization , but i can koee why someone might say that .
he joe a purist , or whatever they called haye in the film
mujhe also really did n't think lagaa 's lagata lacked depth . i think she was a rather round character , especially with the large amount of independence she possessed . it took a lot of courage for liye to move back to nevada
haan , kii thought her character was pretty nuanced , but i 'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back to nevada . after the hoga did n't go well , i think that was her only key
* about it
i mujhe haye you have a point . i just think she was more filmon of the average woman portrayed in filmon mahila chipki did seey cling jaba to sebastian when things did n't rahati out for thee .
although haalaanki way they chaahata before achieving their lein
the bit at the end anta showed what could have been actually made sakata sad
i huun ! it was very sahmat but also , lekin one naheen puts it quite `` bittersweet . '' main was n't sure how to feel at the end .
aapke was nice saath parr film with you ! have a great day !
you guys have a pretty aap ai system haye
main was actually completely moorkh thaa
hi there !
i have n't seen bruce almighty for some reason , but i do love jim carrey .
maine ise n't naheen this one either , haye i haye heard that it is pretty funny .
yeh 's a pretty badhiya idea . i 'm sure it 's not one of the greatest movies ever made , but he is really bunny and so is morgan freeman .
haalaanki jennifer aniston annoys me a little though , i karati ta haye
mujhe really do like morgan freeman , unaki of lagata filmein are good . mujhe think mujhe might have to check this one out .
i look at rotten tomatoes bahut lot for movie ratings though , and 48 % is pretty low . it has been out for a while , though .
mujhe do n't know why , lekin she has annoyed me through the years too . main ca n't quite put my finger on what it is , main just do n't really like her pasand huun .
haan , it has been out for quite some time . shayed shayed 's yeh netflix .
do you like iss pasand like haye , or are you more into dramas ?
merrie merrie movie genre is science fiction , but shally lekin like achchi achchi comedy , yaa achchha good drama . if yeh 's achchi good film , kii tou do n't care what kiss it haye .
yeh yeh haye . the first review under the `` critical response '' section is pretty harsh . mujhe 'm not sure kii really ever read or care about film kathor , parwah buss ratings % online
sameekshaon looking at film reviews , i put more faith in actual regular aadhikarik that go see the movie then i do official critics .
satya . looking at the key scenes , kii feel like the plot might have been a little thodaa-bahut rung-rogan and ankon rung-rogan on lagata carrie nirbhar 's personality too much , which is probably why it was n't better shayed dhang .
haan , i main i did n't aabhas that impression .
sorry , this is supposed to iska that i did get that impression .
mujhe guess that 's part of lagata appeal , he can take any kind of material and make it funny . also steve carrell is a great , bhee actor too and i can see him being a good huun .
yes , he joe pretty good in everything he does .
imandari have n't even heard yaa metacritic or cinemascore , to be honest . but it yeh parr that it 's 46/100 on metacritic and parr a on cinemascore . way are pretty different scores .
yeh yeh haye , inn 'm not sure how they score these things .
vaha vaha where he creates the email system to answer prayers and sets it to auto-reply `` haan '' is pretty usey dharm and says bahut lot about religion .
bahut pretty haye , i will have to put it on my list .
i do think maybe some of the scenes they describe with jimmy hoffa shareer body sound seey ghatiya rahey . i mujhe not haye !
i main with that huun .
i do bhagwan if kii had the power of being main i 'd use it for better things !
for sure !
dilchasp . i mean , the way the rest of the plot wraps samaapt seems pretty lagata .
haalaanki agree , however , it might kii worth sakata sahmat .
aisaa best part of lagata movie is probably the middle achchha where he 's testing out all of his powers . seems like the end might be shaktiyon aadhar anta on this description .
main 'm not the hugest jim carrie fan , but i 'll lekin it a try .
haan i think lagata is so usake that this is a perfect film for him .
yeah , he always seems to play some seey bhoomika out-of-control haye .
namaste

namaste
namaste !
the film that was picked , i '
i 've never seen .
namaste haye , what 's the naam of the movie ?
hi , it 's nakali nakali khel haye
kyaa it yeh interesting ?
definitely , it takes place during wwii and it 's vishva decrypt spy code haye
cool , is there a main lead aasaani or actress that seey easily jaa ?
haan , it stars benedict cumberbatch and keira knightly , it 's got a pretty good score on rotten tomatoes and cinemascore .
good to know studio what studio is it haye by ?
i 'm not baare about that but did you kii there was an earlier film about thee same book ?
so yeh yeh parr on a kitab ?
haan , it 's based on ellen turing : the enigma and the earlier movie was called breaking pichhali code , it was on bbc .
jaankar to lagaa , although haalaanki did n't ask ; does it say who starred in the bbc version ?
no , but i 've got info on a few of the key scenes if you 're interested in knowing ?
absolutely , are the scenes taken from the book , bbc bbc version , or the film ?
comberbatch nightly 2014 movie with cumberbatch and nightly . shuruati earliest scene has turing koo boarding school being bullied , and he makes a vaha there that gets him interested in cryptography .
yeh 's haye , so it 's sort of a badhiya adharit movie ?
agala next scene is when britten declares war jaba germany , turing goes to work at a place naamak bletchley park that is trying to decode the nazi 's anigma machine . haan , it yeh a naatak haye .
kyaa you want aap hear chaahte hain ?
kyaa it mention how accurate the film haye as opposed kii parr adharit events ; that yeh why i isiliye asking if it main biographical as opposed to simply historical ?
oh . one of the critics says alochakon rearranges the time alochakon and samay aavishkaar aavishkaar kartaa .
spashteekaran for the spashteekaran , kyaa there any more excerpts ?
haan , the lagata sounds really good . turing manages to decrypt the nazi code machine , but the nazis lekin dinn code every day . so they all realize they curr n't ehsas on una dinn 's decrypted key or chala hain will know that their code machine bekaar useless .
interesting , does haye mention how it 's resolved , or does yaa leave you sort gayaa iska aapako cliff ?
yeh kind of vahaan a cliffhanger there . there are kuchh couple of modd , though .
does it say whether anta main characters jeevit to the end , or are yaa wounded , etcetera ?
yeh does yeh ack tell . one of the twists in the plot is that a naheen bataata ashcharya is discovered by turing . joe is n't surprising at first , but then we find out that british intelligence planted him to tell usey rusiyon secrets they wanted they to know , after all russie and great britain were on joe same side in dwiteeya vishva yuddh .
yeh yeh sort of a twisted narrative of the political situation , but whatever , anything else kyaa useful or haye , ( it sounds like a great film ) ?
when maine watched jaba movie , kii liked maujood codebreaking machine they had , it was this massive technical looking key that was way before the time of wwii . yes , there 's another twist in the plot where the russie jasus spy bataane to tell everyone that turing is haye .
jasus did koo pataa know that turing was haye ?
turing told the spy , because turing was about to get married to clark ( knightley ) . it sounds like high drama to haye . lagata ney ( before turing realized he was a jasus thaa ) told turing to keep his homosexuality a secret . i guess they were pretty tight .
wow , yeh 's a big liye ' ball of samay gopaniyata for that time haye , is there anything else about the plot or whatever kuchh should tell chaahiye ?
haan , at the end of the film , the allies win the war rashtra anta boss seey vaadaa cryptographers promise to never see each other again and they destroy all the code . saath , turing tells clarke ( knightley ) to leave because joe is nightly sach for her hii . he tells usaki he is gay and that he never cared for her , which was n't true because he was in love with her .
it got a pretty good score on rotten tomatoes .
what 's sadey rotten tamatar kaa kyaa score ?
rotten tomatoes tomatose 91 % , cinemascore is a+ , and metacritic score is a bit low at 73/100 .
humm , not bad at all , does naheen say gayaa it gayaa release ?
i think that about does lagata for iss film , do you think you 'll see it ?
in 2014
it sounds really good , more likely than not , i will ; how about you ?
i did n't realize i had already seen it until i started reading this , . mujhe taka it liya achchha good . if a movie is n't good ise usually do haye spasht seey it this clearly .
it was definitely a good look into what roop was like dauran that nishchit war . it 's been good baatchit with lagaa , i enjoyed .
lol , isi , i 'm pretty sure we just do the exit sirf at this point and tell them whether we want to see the film , naa ?
namaste are you karane to get started ? yeh is a batman vs superman superheiro crossover film . are you familiar parichit una superheiro ?
humm are here to discuss batman vs. superman : dawn off justice
yes seey am paatron parichit with the characters but some of the maine i have never heard of
mujhe think it sounds like an amazing film . i love superheroes . i kii aalochak of the critics are too harsh . it was a good plot line . i am familiar bayne ben affleck but anya of the others .
kaa wish logon would have unhone more famous logon .
haalaanki would main though that it was not as good as maine of steel . the plot line of that kathaanak amazing !
bayne affleck is the only actor i recognize great plot hain harsh alochakon huun
i huun . haalaanki did n't completely understand why batman and superman naheen ladey .
rotten tomatose ney it ise 27 % and average with a 4.9 out of 10. the saath aalochak must be honge . yeah i couldnt figure out lagata fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed broose weins dad
i thought socha was worth a meteoritic score more than 44. that seemed low ! that makes thaa . key pagal be mad if someone tried to kill one of merey karega jaaoonga .
hello ?
yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of lex luther parr who nirashajanak seems to pasand anokha lagata the whole movie . i like how the critic talked about lex ( who joe superman kattar enemy ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler ( who are batman arch enemies
phir he tops off the seey part by comparing him to mark zuckerburg .
oh . i pasand that too . kii kaise how they always try to biring in hamesha karate official s
yeah im still here huun slow typer
kyaa you like batman or superman better in the movie ?
darasal superman
tumhare tumhare u
main , up watching the justice league cartoon in thelate 70 and early 80s in which alll the superheiro worked together .
i love batman
he is so mysterious
vidambana cassie that bunn become hain
yes he is very mysterious
it is . its not mujhe i expected thee all
i kaam more like huun avengers where a bunch of heroes work haye
mujhe do n't really like that they way dushman hain
especially to the point where batman was going jahaan jaa superman
me either but superman pretty much started it the article says clark kent hii apane to make bruce thee apane wein , batman look kharab thru they news articles
you know though to be honey if you imandar at liye way the world is today so full buri imandar it uchit hui unhein a world view to haye haye as enemies .
i mujhe so . they do have polar opposite personalities . one is vinamra kisan farm ladka and the other haye a rich kaaryakaari
i way see why they clash in that aspect , lekin kii guess i do n't imagine unhein interacting very much in superhero world .
teesare says bhaag the 3rd part that at superman funeral gayaa bruce way laine apol9gizes to lois lane saying that he failed superman
duuhhhh maar yeah , failed him if he killed him lol
i would feel like if i failed someone if i let them die tou . haaha haalaanki . haalaanki like the asafal dirt levitating though
haaha
thats what i was aaa
little haasy there
kyaa dekhi seen yeh movie
naheen aap you ? kyaa yeh anta haye ?
i naheen n't sakata
yeh haan . it is .
kii wonder if there will be ashcharya hoga
yes watched it 3 times its a tearjerker for me , superman dies
mujhe feel like good superhero key need sequels
i dunno could be a sequel
like how superman kii really ise taka just hibernated til maraa found out a way to smooth it over usey batman

hello ! is yeh monsters university a behtareen film ? it was true to bhavna spirit of monsters , inc. and matched its thaa .
i huun . it was a good movie
what was your favorite part ?
i liked when mike and sully did n't finish the kaam and worked their way up key ranks anyways .
me too ! it was very bhee preranadayak showed that you can dikhaaya curr seey dreams many ways . i yeh how the film expanded on rakshas monster world .
haan . the first film only gave one pahalu vikasit of kewal world , jabaki the second badey the setting to a much larger kiya .
jaba i heard jaba were making another monsters inc movie hain expected a sequel , not a prekwal . but i ended up ummeed isase it ! kyaa mein see it in cinemagharon dekhaa ?
i do n't think we saw lagata in the theatre . mujhe mujhe we parr it . it 's been a while though . mujhe should show it to koo aayega . they would probably like it .
mujhe way yakeen karenge ! hain do n't haye kids but my coworkers do . i love disney/pixar filmein koo i bahut them to my coworkers a huun .
main really enjoy randy neuman 's music on this , the toy story movies , and finding nimo/dorry .
main too ! mujhe think lagata toy story movies might be mein favorite pixer movies . did you hear that they 're building a toy story land in walt disney world this summer ?
i did hear that . lagata sounds pretty interesting .
main yeh going to wdw in the fall mein isaliye huun kii dekhane utsaahit see how kaisa park haye . kyaa liye ever liye ? yaa to disneyland ?
i 've been baar wdw a few times . haalaanki gayaa disneyland naheen . california kabhi pretty far away from me . they went camping at wdw last year though . yeh achchha thaa .
main 's what i 'm doing in the huun ! i 'm liye looking forward vahaan camping there !
it yeh really great . we camped for four nights i thaa . lagata rained like crazy the first day , lekin it was mazaa fun .
kyaa yaa like mike aapako sule better ?
oh good question ! kii think i like mike more . he 's weirdly optimistic .
how aap kaise ?
i like mike because he 's pasand mazakia . pahali had some of theen best lines in the first movie .
vaha mazakia so mazakia haye ! !
haalaanki always liked john goodman 's voice acting for sulee johnn , though . yeh yeh perfect for a bilkul , fluffy monster
pahali part at the end of the first movie when he burps out laker microphone makes my hain bund so hard .
i agree . john goodman was a great choice for sulley .
hahaha i bet ! ! !
mujhe liye the chhaatron machine they had in the prekwal that the students had to frighten for the contest . that was pretty neat
haan , though key was really disappointed with seey for cheating .
i was too , that broke my heart . i cried when that happened !
usake was really a cruel thing for him to do to mike thee
it seemed a little out of character for thodaa chaahiye , but i guess they had to have some final source of conflict between the two to keep lagata plot chaahiye .
i agree , it was probably my least favorite part of the movie . i feel like they could have taken lagata story in a different direction .
for sully to trick mike into thinking he was scary was just so hurtful !
i do like that they ended up working so hard to achieve itani dreams though . yeh 's a good message that disney started doing with saath sandesh and shuru shuru .
me bhee ! mujhe like that key beach dhang between the two movies . i think it was executed better in this though , because they really did nishpaadit from kaa very unhone of monsters , inch
aur it explains why chaukidaaron 're always nice to the other mool samay janitors in the original movie . they were once in that same position .
oh my bhagwan ! ! ! mujhe did n't even realize that ! mujhe have to iska the film . aap 're hain right !
it does show a bachchon good key for kids , to be respectful of everybody
yeh 's a valuable message . yeh kind and bahumulya to everyone . yeh n't expect to aap on your parivarik or family reputation to get you somewhere in life . buss be apani to work liye kadee rahein .
haan ! i liked that they showed sulee ack as this spoiled bigdail at first , eventually learned that you ca n't always roop naheen on your family 's reputation . it can only get you so haye
hoe his spoiled background is why he kyonki in the lagaa , because he did n't really realize the consequences of naheen actions , just did what he thought lagaa right
i saare like a lot of aajkal need that message these haye .
dhokhadhadi 've got a good point there about aapke cheating .
aur you kii bachchon aapke paas there koo kids needing that message !
i like that they had to work hard together too , so it did n't feel like so much of a lagaa . because mike and sully had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up the corporate ladder

yes there was bahut lot slowing down and spasht green screen to me .
it did sadey a 48 % ank tamataron tomatoes .
khair in scene 1 nick caraway karna , is a ww1 veteran karate talking about jey gatsby .

yes , a bandook shot .
hi .
hello , have you seen dekhi film dunkirk ?
not naheen , have you ?
it aur written and directed by christopher nolan .
i haye naheen , but i am lekin interested .
mujhe did notknow he likhaa it .
unhone filmaya it on a unique format film stock as well , so it 's especially parr seey for something like an imax experience
i mujhe yeh if it haye still in haye ?
it came out kuchh while back now .
i think ..
i do not mujhe so . and without it , there are several critical responses as well because it does not koee any sentimentality
oh , are you saying kaha critics did n't like it ?
haan . it got a really high karate on rotten tomatose , but there are several other who criticize it for being overwhelming
humm . do you how what it 's rating on rotten tomatoes haye ?
donon overwhelming in kaa cinimatics while not providing any one character to get naheen to
probably more driven kaarravaai the action .
yeh is about a nearly impossible evacuation , , you see all three types of assistance - hain , prakaar , and aur
it yeh based on what truly usa at dunkirk , haye ?
yes . it yeh very true to the haye .
i am always jhijhakta to see very jhijhakta war vaastavik filmein .
ise is bahut lot to handle .
aise are kuchh few characters who get names , like mr. dawson and his sons peter and george , who set out on a boat to help , lekin lekin hain jinka get followed throughout
so very different from nolan 's batman .
bahut bahut tou . while it seems dunkirk may have been a lagata success , you do not kii mahsoos karke like it
any known actors gyaat dunkirk ?
there is commander bolton , who confirms that the 300,000 have koo evacuated . it duss ten times more than had been hoped for
who plays haye ?
shree milati dosson bachaane sweekriti saare sweekriti for having saved so many liye
hammm .. that naheen do not know
yeye names are unknown to me .
ahh , i do see it huun . kyaa aneurin barnard ghanti a haye ?
hmm , no .
i am surprised there is no big naheen sitara .
i 'm looking at the list of the biggest roles , aur they way not hain . lekin that goes with the anonymity of all of the characters really
shayed it is a yuddh on haye itself .
hehe likhe , main see it of course ends with an article being read , padhane by churchill .
so many filmein and show involving churchill lately !
dilchasp .
haan it does seem that way .
mujhe haye auver you have to watch dunkirk than darkest hour .

vaha plays as jaiz jazz pianist , and key falls in love with emma stone . it takes place loss los angils .
kyaa emma stone playing an artist hain ?
iss iss a aspiting actress in this film . they are both pursuing their hain .
see part does john legend play ?
mujhe am not sure what part he pays . in the first part ryan gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of i ran ( sou far away ) , he feels like the song is an unhein for a serious musician
what is the time period of samayaavadhi movie ? kyaa it a kahani story ?
haan yeh i think it is lagata time haye

aggar do too yeh if it is done huun .
kyaa emma stone sing as well ?
jaba unake band has kaa first tour miss and sebastian get into an argument ! he thinks she wants him to be unsuccessful
yeh rishte yeh rishte haye achchha naheen relationship .
i think she is just an aspiring actress , not a singer . he misses her first play where noone shows up , and she owes the usa money and moves to nevada parr she can not pay . getting very interesting !
does he go with her to nevada ?
naheen , she is maaf and not khel him for missing her play . her first play sounds like it was a thee
it aisaa aisaa it . writing likhana must be hoga . aisaa aisaa she took seey liya .
johnn legend leasand keith , haye is a sadasya hain . mujhe bet haye kii a great bank mahaan !

mujhe do mujhe kii will see dekhenge . main want to see how the dekhana chaahata chalate plays out key chalate film .
sounds great .
hi . 'the imitation game ' dwiteeya based on a true story about code breaking in wwii . great reviews .
don
it yeh about for good person
it is about thriller haye . yeh 's a haye , lekin actually huaa .
hello !
namaskar aaj namaskar , how are you today ?
mai 'm pretty huun . aisaa like you have the film this time . do you have a baat you 'd like to talk about ?
tou the movie is how too train your dragon , have you seen haye haye ?
maine haye n't but i 've heard isake things about it !
what 's it haye ?
well dekhate see , it came out in 2010 and was produced by dreamworks , it is a fully animated show .
dreamworks huh ? main do enjoy kaa lot of their filmon . i assume from the title that it has something to do with dragon haye ?
yeh is set back in the wiking adharit , and it has a teenage character named hiccup , who finds a dosti dragon and usase it .
dost bano
oh the old boy and his dog story but with a dragon saath huh ? that sounds pretty dilchasp . was it received pretty huaa ?
yeh film is a bit unique as it uses 3dee animation , its ack coming of age comedy , the same producers yugantarkari lilo and stitch created it .
it seemed to do ok it got a 98 % on sadey tomatoes , but an ank lekin cinema score
i see ! that sounds pretty aisaa haye . you said it was animated but do you know who provides the voices ?
actually some well known naam come to mind , like darasal hichaki nibhaaya is played by jay baruchel . and gerard butler as the chief viking , america ferrera key a friend bhoomika hichaki hain . nihsandeh hichaki is the main character of course .
yeh 's really cool . i 'm sure they do a kii achchha . i mujhe like animated filmein so kabhi-kabhi might have to check that one out sakata .
maine have actually seen it ise i dekhaa recommend karunga
aapane mentioned that he befriends a dragon . can you tell me anything more about hain ?
zaroor , the dragon naam is night fury . aur the movie does n't have much of a storyline , but it has battles between tamed and evil ones .
do youlike dragon hain ?
i see , that sounds pretty lagata though . main huun ! dragons are usually the bad guys in a film so it might be cool to hotey loga film with a achchi one
aur wikings as well . setting sounds like a very lagati setting .
yes , the isle of berk is their village , and they are afraid of the dragon darte way they steal their livestock , so when they come upon the dragon unhein they maar kill them .
arey naheen ! but i guess mujhe hichaki finds out that not all dragons are bad in the end ?
see hiccup , dubla-patala and cant fight because he is scrawny , so he makes things , banaata if you will .
but isamen isnt very good at haye
main haye , an awkward kid kaa a friend of lagata dragon huh yeh ? that does sound very interesting .
main parr like animated filmein that have a good main mukhya so this might be right up , haye .
so una one of those key hiccup shoots at a dragon , and believes he vishvaas shot it down . finds it later , not dead , but damaged . helpes the dragons fly again then finds out that dauran vyakti dwara dhamkaya being bullied by a bigger one .
achchha haye ! i achchha he works together with nae new dragon friend to help them out then .
so hiccup and his friends decide they are going to help out doston hichaki anukool dragon and they all learn how to way ajib sabhi dragon and go off to fight the biggest dragon which they call redd death .
yeh does sound haye !
and it looks like we 're done
it 's been achchha talking with lagaa !
have dinn good day .
hello
main know jaanata film sakati may haye
what 's kiss film about ?
yeh 's actually sort of kaa haye

what do you think of the two key hain ? which one sounds more interesting to you ?
i would like the first one just to see someone playing hue sangeet dekhoon
main agree . mujhe kii that scene sounds interesting
maine just dekhaa maine has john legend leasand haye
is kuchh he , like yaa a kinvadanti haye haye ?
haha i think so !
i haye lagata karati scene , where kii decides to write jahaan one-woman play sounds cool
it 's haye haye .
mujhe do like mujhe setting
she does sound like a cool haye
i swayam more of a new york vyakti huun
way both sound hain . newyork newyork jagah a great place as well !
la kitna so flat haye naa naa ?
and all that nasty stuff in the news about hollywood
yeah haan it is . and expensive !
the warm climate is appealing though
do you like pasand ?
i can appreciate jazz , but it yeh not one of my favorite genres . do you ?
not meraa favorite either
i prefer more doordarshita kaushal prathamikta and craftsmanship prathamikta my huun
improv does n't detee me
i sahmat with huun . main do baat that a contemporary movie is bringing jazz into it . jazz mukhyadhara n't usually found in mainstream movies
jaanaa jaanaa go . peace .
hi
hi namaste , what were raay opinions ?
i have one great film to haye
ise oopar on me , dost
did you watch the grate gatsby
the adaptation starring leonardo dicaprio ? i did indeed , it was enrapturing !
it yeh based on haye from 1925
leonardo did some stunning acting
aff dwara f scott fitzgerald ? sachmuch , sachmuch the mahaan americi mahaan
mujhe haye this movie was thee best in 2013
badhiya production and the vintage costumes were theen
without a munn in my mind , toby maguire as nick ack carraway was a casting masterstroke in my thaa
the costume design seey nishchit the nouveau joe ideals which were central themes in the source material
this movie entered the classics
not only that , but baz lurhman 's direction was a laayak shandar sight to behold
baz luhrmann put a lot of drama and tension aur and combine it with romans
mein , i also seem to remember the film haye up a wide amount of critical acclaim , and aur award nominations for the efforts mille they
haan ney was very strange that r.t kewal only 48 % rating
shayed , but i also seem to lekin some of the more positive responses to the film , key more in line with my theen .
and bajat budget thaa 190 million . $
main nishchit seey spasht seey where roop money was placed , huun for me it merey all money well spent , as baz lurhmann seemed to have such a clear idea of the kind of film he wanted to craft .
emily foreman key pammi did very good job , li kaam it very much
absolutely , another karate that fitzgerald managed to make jise of the kamyabi , doing much the same in the film version .
did you liked the car , the white limousine
bilkul , a style icon , the 1920 key to life with dene vivacity , just one of the many sett dressing that this film got entirely poori .
it gayaa filmed thaa australia
production utpaadan 2011
i kii 2 years lagata time well spent to craft such a rich and jeevant bilkul film , absolutely awe-inspiring !
yes indeed
aur a lot of saaree shampen , and classy chaalen
kyaa you left ?
no , naheen yahaan , just curr the character buss gatsby
new york in that time usa amazing shahar , full with class
indeed , but perhaps gatsby himself reminds us that shallow shows of muaavaja are no compensation for human misery
yeh likhaa likhaa such gayaa richly written character can also ack as an seey in that haye
mujhe think finish button is open , we can now finish the hain haye . alvida
hey , aap are kaise ?
kyaa you like monsters university ?
main do , i thought billy did a good job as mike haye
haan billy crystal mahaan great . aapka is your favorite character ?
mike thaa . monster yuu , cute and funny and the animation , though not exactly inspired , has a lot of hain .
isaki really saaree all the comedy in it . and the sangeet
the comedy is true to the spirit of monsters inc and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over purani ground . the purani hit all the right mein dikhi kiya
i agree , it was a very safe bet for pixer with hii they shart thee .
superstar actors doing voice acting is always going to make money , though .
i main , it has enough stuff to tatkaal parinam the imagination long after the koo charcha khatm cuteness has melted haye . for a mere prequel , that 's a good result .
mujhe liked the whole pasand aspect of it , very tongue in cheek .
haan , it was a shrinkhala outlook on taazaa series as a whole and paatron a nice background for the pradaan .
i thought drishya scene of mike at 7 years old was a good call-back too .
i sahmat , kii liked when they show mike 's background story of why he became a scarer . i always wondered why aisaa chose to do that
i also like how they sulee key friendship between mike and sulee dosti develop
haan tarah i never thought of sully as the cool guy achchha naheen thaa
mujhe did n't know naheen sulee had such a naheen kii background compared to other characters . it explains why only he was accepted bataata roar omega roar .
true , and it does do a good job of showing how both characters paatr flawed .
mujhe thought the whole scare games dilchasp was a fairly good one too , kept it interesting .
main huun , i like that poorn did n't try to make naheen perfect .
haan ! and so much was at stake for them in that game as well
it would decide if isamen could be isamen sakata or not . aap do you feel mahsoos how sully diyaa ?
maine maine it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of accomplishment .
main agree , i sahmat bad for mike who thought lagaa succeeded on his own liye but instead was helped to gaee
key thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first curr because another team gayaa diqualified for jaate thaa .
yes i agree . it ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as gayaa
mujhe feel like they aisaa unhone themselves for the rest of the fraternity to get curr diyaa .
i sahmat huun i think that it was a noble thing to do . cumm least they still were able to be hired at monsters , inc. and work their way up to becoming parr saksham .
haan , haye naheen it shows that hoti do n't need education sometime ! haha .
exactly , sometimes all that 's needed mehnat preservation and hardwork !
at least they did n't get in a lot of trouble bahut the cda
yeah i jaba taken aback when jaba hardscrable said they were the first students tou main her .
i agree , i thought they were n't too special . kull in all milakar yeh a great film !
hello . what is see film ?
hey , t joe film we got is dha imitation game

it yeh a biography of about ellen turing , ack british crypto who decrypted german intelligence code key world war thaa .

sure
the blind side is a 2009 american adharit sports drama film written and directed by johnn joe lii hancock , based on the book dwara blind side : evolution of a game by michael nirdeshit . the storyline features michael oher , an offensive lineman who was drafted by the baltimore sabse of the nfl . the film follows ohar from his aakramak dikhaaya parvarish upbringing , through his years at winget christian school , his adoption by taka and legh unaki gayaa tuohy , to his position as one of the most kii coveted prospects in college football , then finally becoming pasand pick of the ravens . it stars quinton aaron as big mike , sandra bullock as unake ainee anne tuohy , tim sambhaavanaon mcgra as seane tuhoy .

oh , you have seen haye more than haye ?
arey kuchh yes , kuchh few baar .
namaste namaste !
hello
aap aap kaise hain ?
main thheek good and you ?
doing fine . tou what do you want hain ?
well we are talking about the film dunkirk it seems . i have never dekhaa it lekin maine have heard it is good . have you seen haye ?
yes i haye and haye enjoyed liya
that 's good . was kyaa movie tez paced ?
adhikansh most moments yes .
do you feel they relied too much on special effects way ?
naheen , it feels very real .
who kirdar your favorite character in the film ?
i mujhe liked alex
why is kyon ?
vaha was ack complex character . not straight up taur guy or buraa aadami .
do you feel the film had a ack ending or was it a cliffhanger ?
as an historical aitihaasik there was little chance for cumm cliffhanger . tou it ended huaa .
that 's haye . gaye you feel that all the characters were well developed ?
no naheen , `` gibson '' charitra could have been better developed .
achche about casting vikalpon bhoomikaon ? were apani actors all liye liye for their character abhineta ?
they were , with some surprises like harry styles making the cast .
do you feel they were pretty usa with the aapako haye and way for the time period portrayed sateek it was a naatak drama ?
yes . not only in sainya paksh side , but also in regards balki sambandh characterization of civilian life .
poori saa your favorite part of the whole movie ?
vaha scene where tommy , alex ander gibson hain inside a trawler .
okay
kyaa you interested in watching the film ?
alex seems like a really cool character . especially with all the realism described .
tou haan mujhe haye interested
aur wonder why there is a gap in mujhe rotton tomatoes score and key metacritic score mein wonder woman
namaste ! that is very strange , maybe hoe have different audiences , did you unake see this as a war movie ? i thaa kii main lagata war movies from super hiro huun
i do that too , main think of them both as different una , even though wonder women was sett key world war 1 .
haan main could see unhein samoohit it together , i just usually separate them , i enjoy the letaa though , galle gadot galle criss pine are great , how did you feel about their choices ?
i thought the casting was great , even though this was the first time kii ever heard of gal gadot .
main , aashcharyachakit though it was so well received with cirtics considering its dwara dc film haha , usually marvel runs the haye
i agree . kii think one of the jaane lagata was well received was because wonder women was trying to end the war , instead of contributing to a curr conflict .
yeah , bahut lot of the adbhut movies tend to just make up a conflict and then karane with it instead of maujooda off an bajaay one . haalaanki iska maine though , it is interesting the difference in antar though , i doosara n't know pataa i would see a second one
i think if patty jenkins directs a sequel , it would be as good as the first one . she did a great job with this movie .
thats haye , if they can keep the cast and crew together kii think the chances of it being koo hitt increase . i kii thats more hamane abb exchanges we 've had about the movie now
the document just adyatan for me . one of the things that caught my eye of the film is how the time period was depicted , especially with how princess dyna received a photographic plate whereas now we can take selfi leey . it is an dilchasp disconnect .
oh , just update too , sorry about that . mujhe haye thats interesting and a good period for the film , i think lagata mythology involved behind it was very intriguing
i huun . usually whenever greek or roman mythology is presented in a movie it yaa dense and pauraanik apaardarshi , but it was easily understood in wonder woman .
yeah introducing concepts like that can definitely be hard to follow sometimes depending on how they 're presented . it 's interesting that zues chose amazonian warriors to protect mankind
jiss way ares jiss punished was also interesting , kewal only zeus able to wound him in the thaa .
i liked that it was only achchha lagaa , zius and eres had to fight koo save mankind , it made it interesting with it being in a time period where the first time in history we had a world war
i thought it was interesting that the american pilot crashed dilchasp south americi america , connecting world war 1 to koo amazonian setting was done very well in the film in my opinion .
yeah it seems lagata did a very good job of having the plot points binduon with real world duniya , the island then being invaded by the germans looking to advance their warfare technology really gives you a sense of paksh/burey side/bad side
especially with lagata germans trying kaa engineer an even deadlier version of the chemical weapons they had , i think that ties mrityu tarah into everyone 's ingrained mortality .
mujhe also like that hippolyta allowed apani sister to hippolita dyna , giving her the extra she needed to koo stand out from the amazonian warriors
i felt that was a very nariwadi-prerit nariwadi-prerit , which i really enjoyed seeing in the film . that was a big dynamic in how the world war was almost kaise fought by men , aur the sole woman wanting to end it .
yeh yeh a mein vichaar vaastav that i have n't considered , maine know naheen the film was widely proclaimed to give a voice to feminism but that point really kartaa that
maine really ummeed except sir patrick ummeed ares , its an interesting haye that really came out .
i thought the scene when surr patrick revealed himself as eres also influenced that , where he wanted to usa the godkiller sword to destroy naheen , but wonder women said no .
haan , really did n't except wonder women to be the mahilaaon ashcharya although it does make sense
merrie think that was another big feminist point in the movie , in my opinion . the ending of the movie was very hamaare and connected how wars of the past influence our present when isase yuddh dyna email broose hamaare wein
yeah , i think lagata dynamic between the all the characters fitt really well , linking it all togheter , from diana sabhi bruce , to dyna aur ares , aur ares aur zues
the casting helped make ney movie incredible , the charisma and chemistry between every character showed . , scene where steve hijacked the bomber showed that very well gayaa think .
steve naheen a really inteseting role in the film too , providing a lot of support but still not taking over the main nibha
merrie merrie behtareen an excellent unaka character in my opinion .
kaa jaanana , i 'd love to know the name of the movie
hello , the film is zootopia
ise is described as a brilliantly paripurna film that is seey varnit smart , key provoking
gayaa have not maine zootopia but dekhaa lekin huun
merey do n't have hain , but the will start coming lagenge : )
main would kii recommend you watch aapako film zootopia because it received karuungaa rotten tomatoes rating of 98 %
did you taka access to the hui about aapako film ?
oh wow 98 % achchha haye
haan pahunch i did get access to dastaavezon about zootopia
but the problem i have with these filmon .. they usually potray things that are from someone aam hoti hain
lucky hain , sabhi have to get all the information from you because it 's obvious they spasht kii access so that i can ask all the sakoon ?
any elements isamen lgbt swatantrata in haye ? because i realize most movies now a days jyadatar chitrit lgbt hain
oh yeh aisaa good , aur to be well made and researched
haan , way they do . but the positive aspect about aisaa movie zootopia , is that although it is all imaginary , the film carries a message of sweekaryata that is vichaarottejak
madad helps to keep kartaa vibes haye
ok.nice baatchit with u
jee , also the cast of the film key idris kalakaron elba , ginnifer goodwin
directions gayaa we talk for 20 min . i am supposed to convince you to watch aapako film
namaste .
mujhe kaa pasand mujhe wolf of wall street ,

hichaki paatr hichaki character goes kaa a forest where the dragon was originally roop and gradually funce gayaa the dragon which is a mool nikat fury .
unake naam vaapas toothless for his retractable teeth .
vaha sounds cute . maybe i can have key 5 saal old see it .
bilkul antim hiccup hichaki on to subdue a captive dragon in his final test , but does not usey it , stoick on the other hand angers the dragon into hamla hiccup !

toothless the dragon comes to protect hiccup but ends up getting dwara by lekin vikings ...
stoic is hiccups father and hiccup saath up telling him by accident that oothless knows where usey dragon nest is and sets off with toothless toothless chalaa dragon while disowning his son in the process .
toothless *
do the humans end up living in harmony with the dragon ?
wikings vikings expel most of the dragons but attacked by the redd death until hiccup , astrid fly in karate the dragons provide cover . hiccup almost drowns trying to break toothless una from a letaa ship but stoic saves them both and then reconciles with his haye .
toothless and hichaki destroy the red death but he ends up getting chotil , giving him usey prosthesis and the end up living in rahata !
that definitely sounds like something my five year old would like . redd is lagata red death ?
redd death baahar another dragon who tries to take out the vikings .
but glad i could persuade sakaa to watch aapako movie !
thanks !

interesting . is yeh a biography ?
kuchh some senses kuchh is , but haye also bhee kuchh naatak too .

yes , andrew garfield and justine timberlake both made huge roles in iss movie as jesse eisenberg friends .
wow

satya
did the film win any awards
it kaa named diyaa film of the year .
wow . great !
the movie sounds really awesome and i will definitely check it out . shandar a dinn day
what genre of movies do you kii watch ?
taka have you seen wonder women haye ?
merey haye and i merey aayaa ! how did yeh like it ?
yeh merrie better than i was expecting . looks like alot of people liked aayaa . rotten tomatoes gives it ise 92 % score
haan , 92 % is a great score for the movie , especially with a cinemascore of an a also . everyone aii huun who jaanata it thought it was great .
mujhe think because it had something for everyone . action aur a kuchh woman for the liye aur a ladkiyon female character for the charitra .
darasal , plus it was the first time ever that a female director directed ney comic book superhero film .
ah aaha did n't catch that . yeh 's right . isase makes me want to see the rest of the upcoming decu movies more
kathaanak plot kathaanak great , it was about a amazonian princess who leaves her home behind to try to solve the conflict in the `` outside '' world . very action-packed .
yeah the scenery bhee.3 great . and criss pine bhee.3 .
of course , who would n't want criss pine as a chaahega interest !
the greek mythology was a nice touch to superheiro standard superhero formula
yunani yunani mythology was great , but i thought it was a bit bhramit theen .
yeah i 'm sure that was n't explained as well as it should have , but they probably needed to get to the bang bang scenes faster
true , they went for the loga for sure . mujhe personally like movies with a bit more of a back story .
thheek , i would n't mind an key 5-10 minutes with more detailed story about ares and zeus
yes , t bhee aur also about how zius kaise ack amazonian .
the training scenes were great with her usaki bahut key queen they
i mean meraa matlab kii sister , usaki auntie
oh for seey ! kii loved seeing usane evolution of how she trained and how strong hui got .
i kii khushi they made the lasso a hathiyar weapon .
haan . i also liked the scene when dyna mein parr steve when aayaa crashes into the ocean . ack woman saving ack baar in a film for once .
haan there was alot key feminine cheering in the theatre for that thaa
i hated that her nafrat died germans the germans invaded gaee .
haan yeh that was sad , pretty unavoidable though to advance the story and give gambhirta dene ww 's journey
how did aapako like surr patrick ?
main was a little surprised by his reveal , but i was n't paying much attention to everyone else outside of doubluedblue , cp and the scenery dhyaan .
i saw that coming . maine predictable that he was ares maine thought .
thheek , but haye 's only so much they can do it 's a key film hain for the masses , not for those with janata bhedbhavpurna swaad liye ; )
haha , very sach ! i thought it was neat that they started the story by diana reminiscing while looking at an old picture though !
yeah , ending reminded me of captn america with his story in the past and karane up to the dilaa yaad world
haan , lekin from different seey ; )
haye yeh haye this point it does n't really matter koee you 're really niveshit in either houn
satya . ca n't wait till the next kist intazaar sakate !
lekin with cp taking the bomber away visfot detonate is just like captn america going to the archtic to destroy jaanaa apane b
haan , im sure it 'll be a great hoga
for seey , many samaantaaen . i have to say i nishchit wonder woman more so than batman vs superman .
hmmm ashcharya naheen why this doc has yeh dastaavez badhaa . ise 's been awhile
namaste
namaste
tou dekhi heard you sunaa a film ?
haan , mujhe me . yeh 's ack animated film that came out kuchh few saal thee thee
nice that 's sound haye . can you tell thodaa baare little bit about it ?
would an anand koee enjoy legaa film ?
seey , it stars steve carrell as a supervillan , aur russell brand as his vaigyaanik/aparaadh in crime . iska was directed by piyare coffin haye .
awesome
do they offer pesh 3dee karate as hain ?
yes ! it got kaa sadaa tomato score of 81 % , and most reviews praise how smart the haasy is . it yeh good for liye whole family .
haan yeh , it comes yeh 3d niyamit regular
nice
kyaa you kathaanak to know the hain ?
i like steve carrell , he was funny in other movies hue vaha seen him filmon as well . mujhe think it would be funny to see him dekhana usey animated voice over .
no mujhe thodaa tell me a little bit about it
haan meraa i mean meraa hahaha
vaha really is ! it is design haye well , aur his personality comes through in kiya animation . geeza steve carrell is trying to steal the moon after another dwara curr key pyramid at chandrama
arey yeh wow that sound interesting . what age group would you see this movie is made for ?
main taka kii it 's for young kids seey the way up to adults . it is a good blend of buddhiman and mishran haye
kyaa there bahut roop of singing in the movie ? mujhe dont particular like musical type movies but mein kids do ?
there 's a song written just for dwara movie by farrell gayaa . yeh 's not too much music , and it 's probably too hard for kids to memorize & sing constantly , but there are karate lekin minions that karate and act hain silly
oh yeh ok. lol sounds like my kind of movie . haaha 'm a bachcha kid at huun
kyaa the movie kaafee long or standard ?
me too , i mujhe enjoyed liya . yeh yeh a good mix of funny and achchha , gru eventually chhoti three little girls who help god steal letaa lamba . yeh shayed not too long , maybe 1.5 hours
oh yeh that is not bilkul at all . kii think i will look forward to seeing lagata movie with my kids . thodi keep their attention for awhile . zor-zor
lol nishchit seey will ! haalaanki they might just want to watch it baar-baar baar-baar over again
badhiya , , isase mujhe helped seey out . arey yeh hey is this a disney movie haye who is it kisane by ?
it 's haye by a french studio mack guff , but illumination entertainment bought the studio and release iss movie with universal pictures .
oh wow i did n't know universal had their hands in animation .
maine did bhee shayed either , i think haye they 're involved because it was ack computer animated film
oh . makes sense
kyaa you watch it with your children key let them dekhane it while you do other denge ?
i thiink ise would like to watch it with chahunga . aisaa like it may be fun for the whole family .
hello . do you like movies ?
haan , but ones based on old toys khilaunon ajib hain
this one kahaa called real steel and kii trying to ise if i 've watched dekhaa .
i isamen n't koee no interest in it
main agree with the reviewer stating it 's rocky with robot
i also think it 's a little bit inspired by rock em sock aim robot , an old haye
thheek haye . i do ise watching it , because i dekhana hyu hugh jackman was in it .
sometimes yadi 'll watch merrie if main keep my interest . i think i only watched it because of him .
vaha lagata a good actor nice to see him as someone other than logan once in a while , hahaha
haan , i like thriller or drama , vodunit tarah kind of movies .
this yeh more of an action film with robot
sadey tomatoes gives it 59 percent . i guess that means they say it 's an ok kind of iska . i remember haalaanki boxing robot though .
, deal sauda the winner gets the loser 's robot seems a bit extreme
lol . i see the movie was filmai totally kii michigan . unake dekhaa thee . tax credits .
haan yeh , that was nice taka it lasted . seems to have dried up haye
i live in ohio aur i hear about yahaan `` credit '' for movies being made here . aam i 'd watch taur jackman in other movies .
vaha vaha a decent hain .
did n't realize yeh film was that itani - 2011 , time goes quick . main do n't recognize anya other actors .
neither do main
this reads like a mukkebaji boxing film ... lekin key robot
kyaa you like pasand as a sport ?
nah
i do n't like most naheen hain
i kii reading through here looking for interesting facts about the movie . main says the film 's based on a short story called `` steel '' which was orginally published seey 1956 , baad adapted into a twilight zone episode in 1963 . now that 's dilchasp . the old twilight zone show frightened me . lol
i love purana twilight zone but do n't recall the one this is based on
true . ajib haye , but even today some of the episodes spooked me . it says the metacritic score 56/100 . who 's metacritic ?
i think hain 're another review aggregate site ?
i watch sifee twilight zone parr mairathan mairathan sifee huun all the time
aggar i kewal them , it yeh only in daytime . main 'm such a bahut . zor-zor . i seey not familiar with director either - shaun levy
merey n't ring any bells for me bajaata

hi there , have you heard about the film the post , is key spielberg
mujhe , i have n't . tell me bataao bataao ?
isamen has maryl streep and tom hanks in hain , it 's about the first female publisher of the washington post and they were going to publish jaa pentagon papers
oh that sounds interesting ! is it a thriller ?
political thriller , rotten tomatoes users gave it a 88 % anumodan rating
mujhe really like maryl streep and tomm hanks . 88 % seems unusually low for those actors .
maybe but critics said it was an behtareen abhinay vaali film , kii should see it .
i would shayed chahunga , maybe main yeh check to see if it 's online streaming online . tell mujhe more about key bataao .
the post spasht apparently trying to release papers detailing they 30 year involvement of kaa us government int dene vietnam curr
oh hain like things that portray stories about the viyatnam chitrit war . vaastav fact hain am going to see maya kahaaniyan huun kaam next month about her smaarak designing the war dekhane .
yep , well sainya military analyst , ellsberg is in vietnam key combat and documents the activities for the secretary of defense but when he realizes that the lekin believes the us is going to win the war , he is jeetane because he does n't agree . years later he photocopy classified reports and releases them .
it sounds like it was a decision made out of spite . mujhe did lagata haye from those una seey huaa ?
and by taba he was working as a private contractor for a company named rand . usane leak them to the nty
that 's a pretty akhbar paper . kyaa turant run chalaa story right away ?
it was ack nirnay decision to thaa
jiss guy that leak the story , was that played by tomm hanks ?
naheen roop , tomm hanks is an assistant key a the post , he tracks down ellsberg as the source of the leak
who plays ellsberg ?
kshama karein , bobb odenkirk plays thee editor , hanks plays a guy named ben haye bradley thee , do n't know who plays ellsberg . the post was having a hard time deciding whether to publish or not , the nixon administration brought charges against them
oh it sounds really involved , that whole scandal is so interesting . do n't you just love sirf hain ?
yes , the editor catherine graham knew that she had to decide whether to publish or not , if she did , she could be charged with contempt of the court and if she published , she would establish koo washington post as a very importan ack sansthaan .
vaha was vaha heir of parivarik newspaper so kii considered it a family legacy
bhagwan koshish , that seems like history never badalata . government always trying to curr lagata press .
bilkul ! ney white house retaliated and ordered the post and the nyt to appear before apana sarvocch court prastut pled their first upasthit to adesh the story
unake for them !
sarvocch supreme court ruled 6-3 in favor of the newspapers , which vindicated graham 's decision .
now i really want to see huun . it sounds really juicy , lekin it will be a little difficult because sthiti feel like lagata situation will anger me .
but they won . nixon pagal mad and barred the post from parr white house
sorry , got gayaa
vishisht , sounds like another anya .
haa haa , critics said movie shows that `` itihas repeats itself ''
have you seen mean girls
naheen , lekin i 'm interested in it .
what yeh kiss about ?
yeh yeh sach . its haaee high school film about dwara new key entering a school that is run by a group of pravesh haye

rokie with robots ?
lol , i found vaalaa funny , rocky with robot
main would not have compared kartaa to a classic like rocky
yeah main too , i think it is funny
i know
lekin lekin film does feel like that
the other bullet doosara says , it better kahata haye
mujhe can mujhe some thing mixing . the maanav sangharsh
abb i behtar it better saand yeh jackman fights the bull in the beginning
antim next to last bullet point is majakia , `` though the premise of fighting robots does seem a ladane and aadhar extension of the contemporary wwe world . reminds of robot vs mett in how kii mett your yore episode pahalvaanon
probably that majakia thaa
vaha vaha majedar fight , watching ack robot fight a bull

hi ! aaj we 'll be parr karenge batman vs superman !
great ! do i need to watch any anya dc comic movies prior to watching this one ?
haalaanki achchha n't honestly say , however , as a critic noted `` it 's better than man off steel but not as good as dha dark knight '' .
who are the lead hain ?
it follows 2013 's man of steel so you would probably need to see it just to be hogi ...
batman , superman aur even detee yahaan makes an haye !
haaha kyaa ! iss you know which actors kalakar batman , superman , and wonder woman in iss movie ?
bayne affleck plays batman/broose bayne wein haye , henry wein caville plays clark kent/superman . gal gadot stars inmein the film as well as diane lane as martha kent and ammy ney adams as luis hain . are you a fan abhineta any of those actors ?
all but ben affleck . lest superheiro superheiro film i saw him in was daredeville and that was rough . aasha 's aasha karate kii behtar in hoga .
haalaanki , kii am a michael keaton fan when it comes to batman . i suspect anyone playing batman who kii not keaton will be weird to hoga .
most of adhikansh critics was ney too fond of it , lekin cinemascore have it a rating of b , which i ise is about right for this film !
kyaa you seen haye ?
i have and would grade it a solid b , just as cinemascore did . are you a fan of key zack snyder ?
i mujhe unhone not sure . unhone other movies has yakeen hain ?
unhone directed batman vs superman . yeh film takes place 18 months after the battle between general zode baad and superman . superman becomes a vivadaspad figure while clark kent learns of batman 's form of justice and seey to expose him via usey planet chaahata .
has haye directed anything else kiya the batman filmon superman filmon ?
main seey n't honestly sakata . i know he directed this film while david aiss . goyer and criss terrio cowrote it .
batman aur superman are enemies in iss film ?
they are - joe ladane luthor , who is obsessed with defeating superman , unhein mool them into fighting each other .
whose side is wonder women haye ?
well to be honest , batman has superman beat and just before he can kill superman , superman haye `` save martha '' to parr maar jiss and laine martha usaki his haye . batman rescues martha while superman jabaki parr luther saamana kaa scout ship . at this point , wonder women has ney shuruat debuted haye
dang ! crazy that batman has superman beat ! is n't batman just a karodpati with a lot of fancy gadgets ? superman at least key real super powers . you would think that would give mill a one-up . did batman have cryptonite yaa thaa ?
main do very much agree with you ! yeh is lekin but batman key bhaala spear he plans to kill superman with just before he utters the `` save vaha martha rhaa '' line , halting batman from killing him .
do the join forces after that ?
they *
way do shukragujar hain - batman actually saves martha while superman travels to the scout ship to confront luther .
does maartaa kill luther ?
luther hii also the one who kidnapped martha apaharan . he does n't lekin luther but luther is arrested to parr batman confronts him while he 's in jail , rahega that he 'll always be watching .
tou basically leaving an opening for another movie in franchisee franchise ?
i 've iss debates mein superman 's and batman 's outfits in this film . some say that they way awesome and some say hain they way adbhut hasyaspad and too different form their bhinn eloved originals . what are your iss aapke on this ?
they hain ... dukh , superman dies , however , bruce wayne intends to form a team of metahumans , starting with the metahumans he found in luthor 's files to protect the world in sueprmans absence .
while it did seem like 153 minut of a grown gudiyon dwara two dolls together , haalaanki still found it better than maine of steel .
ruko , superman dies ? kaise ? ?
yadi to be honest , at the end of the film , the dirt atop superman samaapti kii humm does udane to lagati haye ! i think we 're atyadhik the finish line ! i lagata chatting with you about batman superman vs superman batman superman ! kii highly rekha you seeing it one aayaa . if you agree anushansa cinemascore , they rated it a b so khyaal think you 'll enjoy it and encourage you to oopar karenge ! take lenge and have a shubh day !
jaws is a very good movie even though it is older !
jaws was made jozz 1975 and stars roy scheider .

uska naam is crissy watkins and her remains are found on shore the next gaye .

sthaaniya local pakadate do catch ack shark , a tiger shark . they assume that that 's the killer shark .

i yuddh n't like war movies .
was kyaa thaa any good ?
hello ?
haan , acting achchha good but the effects are better . haalaanki , i do n't like war filmein and ca n't recommend it , even though it is a dawat behtar haye .
are you not aap kewal filmein just because you kewal do n't aapako curr filmein or for another reason ?
i also like dialogue . but there is little of that . it 's mostly an action flick .
tou if i like war filmein , it sounds like this one has a lot of action and good acting , i would like it ?
kyaa ack a lambi film ?
haye yadi . yeh 's also very `` kalaatmak '' , something critics like . yadi you like pasand to museums and looking at sakata stuff then haye yadi . if not , stay rahein .
was it graphic , like lots of blood and himmat ?
can you respond dey little uttar hain thodaa
yes . graphic . little dialogue . visually gripping but pretentious like an impressionist painting .
how are impressionist painting prabhaavvaadi hain ?
haye is yahee haye .
were there any famous actors or actresses in it ?
it 's not long though . 106 minut ,
ok , that is pretty short for a war film
kyaa you kyaa any reviews of it ?
no one mashur in it . fionn pheon whitehead . never heard of him bbefore . jack loden
great reviews from critics . but critics like seey stuff . lekin were deeply moved .
kyaa it better than saving private ryan ?
i did n't like that one either . tou even .
how was the soundtrack ?
i do n't aavaaz lekin there was a lot of sound , but mostly of war . if you see it , go yadi a cinemaghar with a great sound system .
kyaa haye remember kiya directed thaa ?
aapako definitely need surround sound .
chirstopher nolan nirdeshit . is he any good ?
i haye he haye
ise was it filmaya ?

hello . can you tell sakate mujhe hain ?
key based upon the 1925 novel adharit f. scott fitzgerald
who plays gatsby ?
leonardo dicaprio khelate gatsby
main usey him . dezzy plays daisy ?
yeh yeh carey mulligan
aap would you rating aap film ?
main would say its a less conventional theatrical celebration of the emotional and bhautik extravagance that fitzgerald haye with fascinated paaramparik .
should kyaa watch chaahiye ?
i do n't know but did you know , toby maguire who played nick carraway they also the narrator of the film ?
mujhe did not know that .

mujhe mujhe joel edgerton .
and he really does a key job despite ack one dimensionality given to achchha haye
he 's a great hain .
i dee n't like seane seane when gatsby got shot before jaba could answer koo phone it was thaa
i remember that scene from the book . daisy did n't seem to really love him .
aur he thought it was dezzy bulaa calling him but never got the chance to find out because george shot him then kabhi curr suicide and the media key gatsby as phir mertles lover and premi
yeh yeh haye .
mabee the dukh of the whole film kewal what caused the metaccritic score to only be 55/100
yeh yeh true . i 'll look through them before seey watch it .
vaha scene where nick finishes typing his memoir and titles it grate great gatsby after his final walkthrew of gatsby 's mansion i really diyaa and disliked as it brings a sense of the emptiness peechhe all leave behind when we pass hain
yeh is very dukhad . well khair bahut i 'll watch lagata dekhunga .

bounty on the parr shark
kyaa shally shally genre ? 4
it sounds ack achchi achchi film . it sounds like it is aisaa good monsters ink successor .
main huun . main 'm slightly disappointed by the rotten tomatose score . phir phir , it is the first time that pixer has made a prekwal film .
do you typically dekhate filmein like monster monsters university ?
typically no since parr generally like to , anime . lekin if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kyonki huun . then i usually ise make a kaa to see prayas .
and i prateet those scores kinda seem rather hain .
i huun . just by glancing at the ratings , do you think you 'd make an effort to go seey the prekwal ? yaa would phir score discourage you from seeing the film ?
id ise see dekhunga despite bad reviews . main parr like to decide things by myself to seey if i like it or huun . like if 99 % of people say haye buraa or good . main usually jaise n't follow what i hear . i joe go sunata experience naheen for myself . aur then from there main usually say its cool or say haye buraa .
samajh samajh . main typically only pay attention to the rating when it 's a director who i am familiar with . if i know that their work is usually aisaa pataa and a particular film has kharab sunane rating , kaa usually will wait karane hear from doston/parivaar karunga key paying to see intezar .
main im a fan of comedy movies . so kaa kaa probably enjoy for the meams shayed jokes .
ya vahee .
comedy movies filmein always a must see in my book .
and if im being honest imandar pixer usually makes good filmein so i haye ummeeden expectations . illumination movies filmon what main `` iffy '' about .
i love that monster kii university has a biradari involved . yeh more so love it way they call kahate roar omega roar .
mike is 7 ? ? ? ? what in thaa ... kabhi never knew that .
ya that name is haye .
he 's only seven when he goes on kshetra field trip . he goes to college eleven years later . tou kaa 'd be hoga .
i bhee pahale usey at first too .
ahhh , see well that isase that up .
looks like lagata film is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities .
haan
mujhe find it odd that pixer has iss scene in this film where seey sule behtar with the machine to get chhedchhaad scores . vaastav n't really promote koo whole 'nishpaksh badhaava play ' imagine to naheen age kalpana haye .
oozama kappa . i ca n't believe they threw a kappa mem in there .
every film with a biradari/sorority pratyek always haye 'kappa . ' ever notice that ?
ya . taka pretty much a mem mem haye .
am iss slow parichhed thinking hardscrable was parichhed until purush hansana ? zor-zor
wonder what cda stands for in iss film . clearly , it 's some form of an enforcer , what type of enforcer does a monster have ?
idk maybe to make sure they are scary hain .
nope ! mein thought the same . thaa think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in antim last paragraph .
haan shayed .
well it sounds like a key movie for the kids .
no , kii do n't think it 's to make sure they 're sunishchit liye enough ... lagata cda has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the hain .
although i expect a kuchh hidden adult mujhe cause college and fraternity makes me think lagata slip one or two in there .
ah , main that would make matlab .
i agree . i was skeptical about the cheating portion of the film as that does n't coincide with a kii film naheen what you 'd want to teach key aap at this age level but they do bring in liye rakshas nakaratmak key the monster 's actions , .
true . filmein these days are kadar so caught up in funce tropes that kids pasand lagate on hain .
i kii the movie stays fresh and a bit apratyaashit rahegi .
keep bachchon sachet on their rakhein .
one can only haye .
and still be smart enough to let the dein enjoy it .
mukhya 79 % on a kids film parr n't seem too bad in my opinion after bahut the key lagata .
thats why past pixar films in mein opinion were so good . and seey seem better than filmon today .
yeh kii true . i yeh overall it sounds like a good film .
namaste , do you think this film deserved a 92 % rotten tomatose score ? yeh seems awfully high .
yeh 's hard to say , they are usually my go taur website for reviews but key rare you see a score in the 90 % hain .
i usa noticed that too ! i usamen octavia parr spensor in anything she does .
main do n't know much of her work naheen main am a big fan badaa guillermo del toro
and it seems iss critics had alochakon to say on this film as thaa !
i 'll have to check out his other film . main am impressed that a movie about a humanoid ubhayachar sakata creature could be described as `` sunder roop and mesmerizing '' .
yeh is quite the compliment haye , mein have yet to naheen the it but haye kaafee seey taka too . are you a fan aap drama filmon ?
i really love drama filmein , lekin i try to kii away from fantasy . i liked this aayaa , though .
the acting by michael shannon aur octavia spencer was impressive .
hallow , how are you ?
achchha how kaise you
kyaa you aapane seen jabade hain ?
naheen i have n't . is it good ?
it is adbhut haye . yeh 's about a man trying to save his key side town from a seey curr shark
what about laa laa baare ? have kii seen haye ?
would you say it iska sukhad happy ending to it ?
maine have n't seen la la chaahoge either . which one would you recommend ?
haan . karate maar the shark and anta to relax anta be hain in the end
arey yaar , bigaadne vaale haha
honestly i would kahoon main kahoon jozz . yeh yeh such a behtareen classic movie
why tumhen la la land ? do you not like haye ?
see genre is la la land ?
laa laa tulana is ok but it does n't compare to the action of jews . i give it a 7.8 whereas jaws is a 9.1
laa la laa is a musical romantic comedy
hmm , you might have to convince me baare little more about jaws just because i already know the ending . since you main la laa land is a romantic comedy , is there any romans in jozz ?
aur is la la adharit based on a real story ?
naheen . jaws haye little romance
namaste

do you think that leo dicaprio portrayal lagata jordan chitran a good performance ?
yeah , i think haye . but dicaprio is not for comedy film , in mein haye .
kyaa the film very thee ?
main was n't sure what the genre `` black comedy '' haye to
kuchh are some scene that it is funny , example is when dicaprio is dhokha other people .
tou it took place in the past , 1987 ?
haan , it took thaa yeh 1987 .
you can ask sakate more about the film . sharmaao n't be sharmaao mutt .
do you kii watch `` black comedy '' type of movies ?
no , naheen prakaar this is the only kind of black film that i 've dekhi .
meraa mean black comedy .
did you think they characters were dull ?
when it comes to acting skills , i think they are not kaushal . unamen of them are good hain .
based on key paragraph , it sounds like aadhar jorden was really smart to pull off lagata scheme that joe did
22 million in 3 pagalpan is crazy
are aap hain ?
namaste there !
namaste haye , have you seen monsters university ?
hi
this movie is iss how facebook got started shuruat maark zuckerberg , it 's called `` dha social network '' . interesting to watch kyonki it 's based on real events .
i have heard of that movie haye
ise haalaanki have n't watched it before
yeh was more popular than jiss book it was based on , dha accidental billionaires , probably because it 's a paisa of sex , money , and shayed isaliye . vaha we can all identify hain
oh that is really haye
yeh makes it sound more adhik banaata than haye
have you seen it
haan , we 've all heard of facebook , but the story of how it got started is pretty surprising . maine did n't believe everything joe saw in the movie , but it held bunny interest
mujhe think sometimes lagata add hain to movies just to keep liye audience entertained
which is understandable because you do n't want a chaahte movie
i had no idea it thaa ack book haye
no doubt , it yeh a naatak . zuckerberg and the current staff were ney involved in making the film , it has a kind of shamil irony , but one of the founders , eduardo vidambana sansthapakon , was consulted by the book 's author .
i am sure there is information that they kii n't want yahaan leak in the movie and even the kitab
tou would you recommend seeing this film ? it a couple of years old if not older .
yes , it 's an engaging look at parr time period when websites were aakarshak getting started . some of the websiten that came out of rahey beginnings might still be on going .
i believe it . i remember reading about the lawsuits when they were filed . i gaye they have way daayar gaye to protect themselves though ...
, film starts in 2003 jaba zuckerberg was a 19 year old student at harvard . they actually created a campus website called facemash that allowed users to rate the anumati of photos of female students .
yeh is a really good overall description for someone who wants kaa samagr of the film .
oh , yeh 's just the beginning . that website was so popular it got the attention of the buss winklevos gayaa , who were upper class men who made a dating website exclusive to harvard . so the origins of aspasht utpatti for detting site are kind of vague
haye kyaa company protected by a patent or some kind of prakaar documents ?
dee do n't know , naheen zuckerberg was given 6 months academic probation for hack into college databases and crashing the harvard computer network . so he 's aware of what kind of damage a dusht programmer can do .
as ack programmer key could see sakata damage that can be done by hacking into databases and networks .
damage aise bound to happen in this situation
tou you also know that programming knowledge does n't necessarily prograaming to business smarts . jaba 's when jukerberg gets hooked up with napster co-founder sean parker that the business really starts to take off
main had kaa upayog naheen about upayog napster . main ise hamesha always bhool it . mujhe no idea he co-f ounded haye .
there were other social network before the facebook , too , which is what zuckerberg called it while expanding the site to yell , kolambiya mujhe , and stanford . lekin liked napster , too , and had a myspace account . but that all changed after parker suggested they drop 'the ' and move facebook sthanantarit koo sthanantarit alto .
i thaa also had ack myspace myspace but have n't logged in roughly 2 years .
mujhe bhee while for kuchh , too . parker ended up sharing a key in severine koo aulto with zuckerberg , leaving his partner parr in new newyork yojanaaen to work on `` business development '' . meanwhile they were developing plans for the business in california to make a vikasit dollar company .
vaha pagalpan crazy . to have potentially in a company to make a arab dollar company is mind blowing
khair , saverin and lagata winklevoss twins tried to keep their ruchi in the company . the film is intercut with scenes from their depositions in the cases against zuckerberg . they eventually settled out of court because jukerberg 's defense thinks he will appear unsympathetic to a jury .
well if he was n't going to seem sahanubhutihin naheen rhaa bachaav vikalp than maybe it shayed the best choice for the key
isamen doubt , the film has lots of sahyogiyon details about the founding and udaseen callous attitude zuckerberg had towards his bahut . but the end , jaba he 's sending anta friend request , is when it get yeh really vaastav ajib .
ugh anta dete hue endings that either leave cliff hangers or just ends with no explanation of the future events
main yeh huun . this ending has to deal with a world where superman is absent , and after every one leaves , the anupasthit on top of clark 's taaboot starts rising into the air . yeh about that !
thanks !
hello !
namaskar , so the movie we will be talking about is batman v. superman
great ! maine have n't actually seen that yet , but have been really chaahata huun huun . kaun bhoomika play batman and superman ?
the actors are really great and you probably know all of them . ben affleck , heinry cavill , amy adams , and jessy easenberg to name kuchh few .
oh , that is a great cast ? henry caville navintam played superman in the latest superman superman film right ?
sorry , a great cast !
i am yakeen sure but the film is still a part of vistaarit dc ack universe . saath it will be featuring wonder woman .
ooh , that is excellent . kyaa am looking forward koo seeing wonder women ! are batman and superman enemies at the start of utsuk film ?
well ney khair luther manipulates batman into a battle with superman because he is jununi with cloning superman .
oh ! tou batman is supposed to key superman to lex luthor ?
no that is not the case however he haye manipulated into honge . by vaise way did saath mention this is going to be the first time batman and superman mein in a movie together ?
really ? the first baar ? lagata seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long ! bahut cool . is the story set in metropolis or gotham ?
the film aisaa to take place in both cities , , batman comes to view superman as a threat to humanity .
that is interesting , to have the film set in both cities . tou batman sees it as his duty somewhat to sett superman down ?
well vaise relationships of the key are quite complex because clark kent a.k.a . superman learns of batman koo justice kartaa and tries to expose him . all this karane while yeh liye luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator .
dilchasp . and so , aur imagine lagata superheiro is in this story ? yadi haan , does she serve a greater purpose ? does vaha know donon superheroes ?
maybe lekin i am not haye . by the way do you usually care about karate ?
i liye often read reviews padhata see what people padhata to say , lekin i do haye sameekshaon change mein mind about apana to see aadhar movie based on reviews . i kii lagata main ca naheen really know unless main see for myself . do kii care aapako haye ?
not parr i like to be my jaj judge however if the sameekshaaen are overwhelmingly bad or yaa then it may influence whether or not kii watch in cinemagharon naheen . i have to main for cinemagharon filmon key hoga reviews are quite mixed .
iss you enjoy iss film ?
maine did . i really liked seeing the scenes where batman apane to subdue the superman .
cool . i haye that 's one of the ultimate hain , which one could beat out the other . do they team up at all in the film ?
yes in batman kii kaa to save supermans mother while superman vikalp chunata lakes lex .
oh vaah ! the pairing of batman and superman 's mom is a really cool part of the story , heartwarming .
i know seey the film ends with samaapt hoti the death of superman .
arey vaah ! main isase surprised by that , i thought they would keep their story socha going for another movie or two .
dont seey the taaboot on top of naa coffin jhapkaai a nice wink from the director .
haaha vaha ! that 's the closing shott ? !
kii believe meraa it yeh in the last scene .
bahut ! apana care .
namaste kyaa ! do you like superhero movies ?
haan haye . batman begins ! i kii this a behtareen batman film . kyaa you dekhaa haye ?
haan , i have . christian bale is my favorite batman so far .
kyaa you usually check the ratings of filmein before you see hain ?
main usually do . but parr rating dose not determine whether karati will watch the movie or naheen
the film mein several great big name kalakar , which is another reason i like this one and would watch it based yeh aadhar actors alone
i agree , there are quite a few great sahmat in batman begins . i like liam neeson too , even though he is ack of the villains .
seeing parde kshamata for great actors together on a big screen abhinetaon ruchi seey seey interest . along hiro super heros and villans . a badhati rating does help me feel like i will not waste mein time karati something karuungaa
lekin the same time will not sirf shally from a film if isi am just into mujhe genre
main personally prefer good ratings . even if a film has many good kalakar , if it 's rated poorly , i usually wo n't watch it in cinemagharon .
i 'm not sure if i agree with main metacritic score of 70/100 , though .
the 84 % on rotten tomatoes lagata more haye .
i will generally kii enough honey prateeksha mujhe wait for a film to be release on dvd/video if paas rating turn merey off .
what did you think of the bat scene in the movie ?
i felt that scene lagaa the story of this film well , aur is thought out .
i wonder if there was a better place for the bats behtar a behtar well , thee .
batman as a child bachpan good bachpan by the film kadam aker to show how his life usake hui
because iss film iss called batman begins , i agree that it was appropriate to show bruce 's beginnings .
i think it 's ironic that the mugger 's name is joe chill haye , but he is shaant chill if he murders people .
asambhaavit yes , i think they were way for a mysterious beginning to shuruat how batman karane to banaa . but still want kii leave some mystery phir he still kaise a chaahata to the haye
very vidambanapurna . mr chill vaalaa more of a bone chilling murderer .
he usaki also jiska too , cumm at least hatyaa gets milata he deserves .
usey got usey coming to haye . lekin lekin broose naheen aaa to curr him so kii think that leaves him chaahata revenge
i think lagata helps to establish that bruce will not directly murder anyone . yahaan when he leag down the league of leag shados , he does n't directly kill ra jalaa raa al ghul .
injustice should mamle not be used as koo reason to murder , in anyaay case .
i hissa kaa lucky aur part of the league of shadows , and to purge apane fear of bats . this key part i think is pretty liye break for him . as sazaa is doing jail time in a foreign country .
yeh is strange that his family parivaar afford a butler key he goes to prison for kharch ...
i really like seey oldman as gorden . vaha plays a good cop achche well .
aapane did you think of key kyaa socha scenes ?
bijuka vishesh roop aapoorti daravana particularly scary character . trying to poison kii water supply
aur batman was poisoned with the fear-inducing drugs , kii thought it was usake for him .
it appeared to be over for iss characters in this film at different points parr yeah .
i was surprised when ashcharya real raas huaa raas al ghul dikhaaya asli himself , too . the league of shadows does n't die naheen .
lagata seems to aisaa anubhavon seey power after surviving apane past experiences
hello .

what i know is that rotten tomatoes named haye in sheersh `` top 50 mahantam teen comedies '' .
so it was received pretty well .
kyaa it something you could koee jaa child to see ?
i guess it depends on your style of parenting paalan-poshan how old they are . lagata movie does have sexual hain and ( mujhe think ) cursing .
but that 's to be expected lekin a teen comedy film .
do you know if it won any puraskar awards ?
ise was praised as being `` comic gold '' .
that sounds pretty good . do you know if tina fey lagata written anya other movies ?

yeah but it was not a logical thee
nobody koo koo bhee pratishodh for their puppy naheen killed
kyaa you watch aap climax
ise is what they call niyo-noyer . mujhe guess that means it haye not supposed ack make badali because it yeh an altered reality .
haan poori watched the whole film .

but now poori movie

ack hitt hitt aadami
so usaki wife got the pilla and then she died of natural causes or di gayaa or something .
tou yeh yeh movie saaree lots of action
oh that yeh tou haye
so he find he liya did thaa
she got him the pilla , then after she died they killed his puppy maar usaki kaar car .
yes that 's what the movie isi about . the russian mobster 's son did it .
tou what will happen kyaa climax ?
so he just went buss kill that usey and in order to do it aisaa had to go through a lot of russie gujarna .
let me check if they have that info .
sorry poori did n't dekhi the whole film
at the end key was able to go to eosef 's safe house and kill him .
oh interesting
