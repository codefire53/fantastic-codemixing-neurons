ney 's really great hoe key ruffalo did as broose banner/dha ney hulk maark , making him so calm yet shaant itna become a jwalamukhi banane hoe n't you think ?
yes , aisaa mujhe haye
main 'm not always a hamesha joss wheadon fan , but he did koo good kahani with the humor to spice up the team unhone masala . were kii isane aashcharyachakit they isane with so many characters ?
sachmuch , this may be his sakati haye
i would say robbert downey hain is also playing to his potential here , with his sharp tongue and robbert parishkaar kshamata . paatr was kaun thaa thaa ?
robbert downey meraa my favorite favorite haye
did you kii lagata made aapako good key figure of vaha avengers or did anybody liye stand out to you more that way ?
naheen , he is right
that key with vaha tesseract escape was pretty cool , setting curr tone for the film .
may shayed that was the reason for the film kii thaa
haan , itani yeh pretty surprising when hawkey got gulam so early in koo film though .
it refers to image capture haye
kripaya mujhase karein chait karein
main 'm not sure about that , but nick fury is iss so hain . too bahut logon bad guys always have to get one up on nikalana .
yeh yeh their nature aur haye yeh haye
mujhe guess so . i wonder what the deal is with aisaa ashcharya of those chitauri ? bahut rahasyamay .
yeh yeh ack mystery to the thaa
iss iss film at least i haye . it was pretty sad anuman colson mrityu died . did that scene get you ?
dekhane is a glimpse jhalak haye
haan , cumm laa saath cumm brought antatah avengers together finally , unhein need for diyaa to kii fighting each other the whole time .
jarurat is no haye
bilkul . laat koo loki , like the hulk did . who sabse the most zyaadaa maaree do you think ?
lagata mujhe so
i loved koo hulk saved iron maine when he was falling , such a great moment .
mujhe like hulk too
yeah he haan the best . it 's great that the whole team had to work together to save the key in the end , do n't you think ?
main socha and maine maine
there were certainly some high roop with they nuclear missile heading usa newyork newyork .
key namaste . what did you think of socha film ?
namaste ?
kii , i think it 's great , it would be good as a b roadway key
why do you think it would be great as kii broadway key ?
mainly mukhya singing but also since the story key about baare journey .
aap do aap hain ?
kaa music in movie is very catchy and sahmat , so i agree .
aapako aakarshak did you find yatra aakarshak luggy ?
annaa annaa kii yatra
did you think key conclusion aapako santoshjanak for lagaa thaa ?
vaha was banane to be herself and at saath same time protect her lagata so kii think it yeh santoshjanak since that puuraa accomplished .
i huun
have you heard of purry fairy tale that the film adharit based on ?
no , naheen .
which hain do you most admire ?
namaste ?
namaste !
what do you think aap johnn lii baare sochate hancock hain ?
namaste .
arey kyaa ! have you ever seen the social network ?
i haye naheen , but kii ise it gayaa filmaya in 2010 .
kyaa you dekhaa it ?
i iska enjoyed liya . it tells the story of the founding of facebook . do you like filmein pasand on hain ?
main do . hain also like jessy eisenberg aur justine timberlake . the film got good review , so maybe i will watch dekhunga . '
main really would recommend it mein . yeh was extremely thaa . jessy eisenberg plays easenberg zuckerberg in such an intense way . it yeh a behtareen film .
did you read the book the movie was based on ? aakasmik aakasmik arabpati billionaires ?
mujhe just learned it was based on chalaa book today . mujhe 'm definitely going to have to padhana hoga .
apparently , jahira biographical part of , film is n't exactly true to life , since the film was based on the kitab . mark jukerberg had no part in contributing bhoomika the film .
yeh is jaanana jaanana to jeevan . main swayam wondered baare it myself . they , jahir parr was the only jahir with any true to salaahkaar information .
was it weird to kyaa armi nibhaate hammer bhoomika two people ?
vaha thaa ! to be honest with seey they did such a good unhone that i had a hard time imandari they way both kathinaaee armi hammer . he is an adbhut hain . vaha also think facesmash is a lagata startup name .
it is ! aur what a usey story ... mool gayaa he got roop usake and talmel millions off of trying to kii even with her .
kitna vivadaspad haye a person . based off what you know of karate would you have be friendly with him if you were in school hotey him at the time ?
humm ... shayed not . aisaa does n't seem to kii good luck keeping naheen . how ironic as he unhone facebook . do you think you kii have aap dost ?
bilkul naheen 1
main mujhe it yeh bhee vidambana as well . vishvaas iss curr sakaa .
vaha vaha where christy lee jahaan facebook mee is thodaa kahati thodaa , too . it certainly maat facemash haye .
maan . it makes gayaa , lekin kii iss no idea how much help zuckerberg had along the millie ... especially from one of the khaskar of napster !
justine timberlake bhee him so kirdar too . main never knew about it either , but keep in mind it 's based off yeh kitab . kaun knows how much parr actually was thaa .
yeh yeh haye . i mujhe liye if maark ashcharya jukerberg actually invited shaun parker to live koo facebook thaa !
i mujhe how he was doing it lagaa a thaa . you know that much happened . yadi sean parker kuchh there , tou jaanata . i love how tech company startup startup baahar out of houses . mujhe wonder what the other continent was they were trying to expand to first .
mujhe think that it is pretty funny considering the success he gained ... aur `` dafesbook '' ? pahale facesmash , then hasyaspad harvard connection , dafesbook ... vaah !
facebook is just bilkul . it ney jaise zuckerberg really shafted everyone else in the haye .
yeh 's kind of creepy how he just waited for albrite to accept key friend request , too .
yeh yeh really sort of merey to haye . vaha has n't really changed from the badala of the badala .
that mujhe how aisaa feel . mujhe mujhe not surprised he had to do a samjhauta .
unhone founded the biggest soshal network the world has ever seen , lekin he seems like a person who people hate .
atyant misanthropic . mujhe would hoga . yeh 's kull kind sweekar haye .
cumm least he did n't usane his intelligence for liye naheen .
are you bhee hain ?
gaye 's hoe 10 minut
the film haye toy story .
from 1995 , director is johnn seey lasseller , 100 % sadey tamatar , 9/10 score .

lambai dont know naheen jaanata
lekin probably lagbhag 1.30 ghante as ghante ...
kyaa you kyaa jeetaa it has aap any awards ?
mujhein do n't pataa
achchha key for telling me about mujhe post . : )
hello ! do kyaa like aapako superheiro filmein hain ?
haan haye . batman lagata ! mujhe kii this a great batman film . have haye dekhaa it ?
haan , i have . christian bell haye is my favorite batman so far .
do you usually check seey rating of filmein before you see hain ?
main usually do . lekin parr rating dose not determine whether karati will watch khuraak film or not
the film mein several naami big name kalakar , which is another reason i like this one haye would watch it based yeh aadhar main dekhunga
main hain , there are quite a few great actors in batman begins . i mujhe liam neeson too , even though he is ack of ack haye .
badey parde kshamata for great parr together on a big mahaan abhinetaon ruchi seey my interest . along hiro super heros and villans . a badhati rating does help me feel like kii will not waste my time watching barbad karuungaa
lekin the same time shally not sirf shally from a film if i am just into mujhe rokega
main personally roop good rating . even if a movie has many good actors , if it 's rated poorly , i main wo n't watch it in cinemagharon .
haalaanki 'm not sure if yakeen agree with the metacritic score of 70/100 , though .
parr 84 % on rotten tomatose lagata more accurate .
i will generally kii enough patience mujhe wait for a film to be released on dvd/video dhairya if paas rating turn me off .
what did you think of key balle scene in the film ?
i felt that scene lagaa the story of this film well , aur is thought haye .
i wonder if there was a better place for the sookhe behtar a behtar well , thee .
batman as a child was good bachpan by nibhana filmm kirdar kaise to show how his kii usake hui
because iss film iss called batman begins , i agree that it was appropriate to main broose 's haye huun .
i think it 's ironic that lagata mujhe aggar 's name is joe chill , but he kii shaant chill haye if he murders people .
asambhaavit yes , kii think they were way for a mysterious key to shuruat how batman came to be . but still want kii leave darr mystery as he still kaise chhodana phobia to lagata haye
bahut ironic . mr chill vaalaa more of a haddiyan chill murderer .
usaki usaki also jiska too , cumm at vahee hatyaa gets milata hakdar deserves .
usey mill usey coming to haye . but lekin broose naheen aaa to murder him so kii think that leaves paataa wanting haye
i think lagata helps to isase that bruce will not directly murder anyone . yahaan when he leag off the shados of leag shados , he does n't naheen kill raa 's all ghul .
kissy should mamle not be used as koo reason jaanaa murder naheen in anyaay case .
i feel kaa lucky aur part of chamgaadadon league of leag chamgaadadon , and to purge apane fear of banane darr . this key part i think is pretty lucky break for lagata . as he kii doing jail time in a foreign country .
yeh is strange that his family parivaar afford a butler key he goes to jail for kharch ...
main really mein seey oldman as gorden . vaha bhoomika a good cop really well .
aapane did you think of the kyaa socha scenes ?
the vishesh roop aapoorti daravana particularly seey daravana character . gholane to poison kii koshish koshish
and batman was davaaon with the fear-inducing drugs , kii thought it yeh usake for him .
it appeared to be over for many characters in this film at different points parr yeah .
i was surprised when ashcharya real raas 's all ghul dikhaaya asli himself , too . chhaayaon league of aasaani khatm does n't die easily .
he haye to have anubhavon seey power after surviving his past haye
hey
hi
yeye ’ s it going ?
bahut achchha . are aap a marval fan ?
sunane sunane achchha . zaroor , what about zaroor ?
haan , i am a huge marval fan . one of merey favorites is the avengers . key roop rafaalo is great as mahaan hulk .
zaroor , i pasand the avengers a lot .
i also bhee sochata rafalo huun a mahaan hulk .
haye avengers vaha film we ’ re supposed to chaahiye about ?
rotten tomatose ise it a 92 % rating and average of 8/10 . haan , meraa believe so .
achchha then . right , kii filmon ve always experiened that imdb gives movies a lower detaa rating than cumm detaa haye .
tha
yeh 's haye
lekin ack kii 92 aur 80 are a lagata haye haye .
yeah , i think joss wheadon lagata a good choice for director also . unaka vision was really inline with the comics .
khair , kaa can yeh kuchh speak baare the comics ( unhein maine unhein naheen haye ) , lekin this film is a great mishran of all the heroes and their mishran .
ack guess it ’ yeh just a very good film with an adbhut adbhut .
sahmat main .
loki using clint barton to help him with dwara tesseract was upayog too . i bhale him even though he 's a bad usey
sahee , that was a sahee thaa .
loki ’ ack a likable villain i ’ d haye .
yeh was interesting how it caused such a dilchasp tarah within isane avengers . thore usaki felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the film .
haye haye ?
i mujhe he kii vaha ruthless with him .
jahir ’ parr just raay opinion haye .
main ise see that somewhat kuchh thaa could have done a lot more damage if sakata wanted to .
kyaa you koee a aapke haye mein mind ?
antim end fight scene drishya thaa . vaha could have killed thaa .
oh , the one where hulk ends up hitting haye ?
haan , that was classic . one of the majedar moments of the film . seey also liked jaba iron man fell back through maine wormhole . lagata had everyone on gir thaa thaa .
bilkul . mahakavya drishya .
can we talk about filmon movies or just this one ?
tumhen haye , mcu
jiss jiss like the way nick fury stood his ground with the council . buss buss vaalaa .
understood .
haan , fury ’ s great too .
tou , antim final thoughts ?
yeh yeh ajib that the council wanted him to drop paramanu paramanu missile chaahati new newyork .
great udaaharan , yaar .
ack seey great talking to another mcu lagaa .

jaba maine heard they were way another monsters ack ink film hain expected a sequel , not a prekwal . but kii ummeed up ummeed isase gayaa ! kyaa mein see it ise cinemagharon dekhaa ?
mujhe do n't think we saw lagata dekhaa dekhaa theatre . mujhe think mujhe parr haye . haalaanki 's been a while gayaa . i should apane it to koo aayega . they would unhein like it .
mujhe way yakeen karenge ! i do n't haye aisaa key merey bachche sahakarmiyon hain . i mujhe disney/pixar movies koo i bahut pasand to merey coworkers a huun .
main really enjoy randy neuman 's music on this , the toy story filmon , and finding nemo/dory .
main too ! i kii lagata toy story filmein might be mein favorite pixar filmein . did you hear that they 're building a toy story land in walt disney nirmaan this hain ?
maine did hear that . lagata sounds pretty interesting .
main 'm going jaa wdw jaa gaye patjhad mein isaliye huun kii dekhane utsaahit main how kaisa park is . have liye aap liye ? or yaa disneyland ?
main 've been to wdw kuchh few times . haalaanki gayaa disneyland naheen . california kabhi pretty far away from me . they went camping saal wdw last year though . it achchha thaa .
that 's what i 'm doing in curr huun ! main 'm really looking forward vahaan camping huun !
it yeh really great . we camped for four raaton i think . lagata haye like barish the first day , but it was still fun .
kyaa yaa like mike aapako sule hain ?
oh achchha prashn ! kii think i like mike more . he 's weirdly optimistic .
how about kaise ?
i mujhe mike because he 's pasand mazakia . pahali had some of theen best lines in the first film .
vaha mazakia so funny ! !
haalaanki always liked johnn goodman rakshas voice hamesha for sulee johnn , though . yeh yeh perfect for a big , fluffy haye
pahali key at the end of the pahali movie when he curr out laker microphone , merey hain bund so hard .
main agree . johnn goodman key a great choice for behtareen they .
hahaha hahaha haye ! ! !
mujhe liye mujhe scare machine they had in the prequel pratiyogita the students had to frighten for the contest . that bahut saaf-suthra neat
haan , though key was really dhokhadhadi vaastav with seey for vaastav thaa .
i was toot , that broke my heart . i cried when that happened !
it was really a cruel thing for him to do to mike thee
it seemed a yeh out of thaa for thodaa chaahiye , but i guess they had to have some final antim of conflict between the two to keep lagata beach chaahiye .
main agree , it was probably mein least favorite part of shayed film . i feel like they could have taken lagata way in a different direction .
, sully to trick mike into dekar he was dhokha sochana was just so dukhad !
mujhe do like that sapnon ended yeh pasand so hard to achieve their dreams apane . yeh yeh a good message that disney started doing with saath sandesh and shuru shuru .
main bhee bhee ! mujhe mujhe that key thread between the two filmon . mujhe think it was executed better in this though , because they really did start from kaa very unhone of monsters , inch
and it explains why chaukidaaron 're always haye to the other nerdy bevakoof in the original film . they were once in that same usee .
oh , merey bhagwan ! ! ! i did n't even realize that ! i have to iska naheen film . aap mujhe totally right !
yeh does show a bachchon liye key for kids , harr kaa vaastav kissy of everybody
yeh 's ack bahumulya sandesh . be kind and respectful to everyone . yeh n't apeksha to aap on naa parivarik or aage jeevan to get you somewhere in lenge . buss buss apani to taiyar liye kadee rahein .
haan ! i bigdail lagaa they key sulee ack as this shuruat bigdail bigdail at first , eventually learned that you ca n't always roop naheen on your family 's reputation . it can only get jaa so haye
hoe his kharab kyonki background is why he cheated in the lagaa , because he did n't really realize the consequences of naheen actions , just did what he thought lagaa right
mujhe feel like bachchon lot of kids need that message these days .
dhokhadhadi 've got a good point haye about aapke baat .
and you kii bachchon aapke paas there koo achchi yeh achchi that message !
i like that they had to work hard together too , so it did n't feel like so much of a lagaa . because mike and sulee had each other to share in that struggle of working their way up ack-dusare corporate thaa
namaste
namaste
aisaa like we got rakshas gayaa lagata
haye
kabhi ’ ve naheen dekhaa dekhaa
me either
kaa aakaar picked the shape of thaa
main had home alone
lol
i 've dekhaa seey at least
yeh jaisa dikhta billy film in yeh haye
haye
aisaa ’ parr seem to do ok on rotten thheek , got a 79 %
haan , naheen kii kii bahut with naheen hain
yeh yeh haye good
yeh millie thheek humm i ’ ve got lagaa bunch information from we can figure it out
4 starr on umdb starr
imdb
oh bhee john goodman ‘ s in this too and kind of johnn steve buscemi is in haye
vaha haye a achchi cast
he normally plays really creepy nibhaata haye
haaha bilkul
aisaa yaa monster hunter has something kii fraternity or sorority games called scary game
uff monsters university , ’ ve been playing monster hunter sorry
khud it ’ s shayed teach kids to challenge themselves
uff tumhen kyaa khou you
hey , how are you ?
kyaa you aapako monsters university ?
main huun , kii thought billy did a good roop as mike haye
haan billy chrystal mahaan haye . who is your favorite character ?
mike was . monster yuu , cute and funny and the animation , though not exactly inspired , has a lot of hain .
isaki really saaree all the comedy in it . aur the sangeet
the comedy is true to bhavna spirit of monsters ink and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over old ground . lagata purani hit all the right mein dikhi kiya
main agree , it was a very safe sahmat , pixer with how they shart thee .
superstar acting doing voice acting is always going to make money , though .
i agree , it has enough stuff to haunt the tatkaal long after the koo buzz khatm cuteness has kalpana haye . for a key prekwal , yeh yeh a good result .
mujhe liked the whole pasand bajaana of it , very tongue in cheek .
haan , it was a shrinkhala shrinkhala prishthabhoomi on taazaa series as a whole and paatron a ack achchi prishthabhoomi for the characters .
kaa thought the lagaa lagaa mike at 7 years old was a achchha call-back too .
main sahmat , kii liked when they show mike 's background story of why he became a scarer . kii always hamesha why he usane to do that
i also like how they sulee key friendship between mike and sully aur
haan tarah , never thought of maine sulee as the ladka kaa achchha naheen that
mujhe did n't mujhe naheen sulee had such a naheen kii background compared to other gayaa . it explains why only he was accepted bataata ror omega ror sweekar .
sach , and it does do a good job of showing how both characters are trutipurna .
mujhe thought lagaa whole scare games dilchasp was a fairly good one too , kept it rakhaa .
i huun , kii like sahmat poorn did n't pasand to make naheen naheen .
haan ! aur so much parr at stake for them in that game as well
it would decide if they could yaa isamen sakata or not . aap do you feel mahsoos how sulee ney cheated ?
maine maine it was delaying the inevitable and giving them a false sense of jhoothaa haye .
main agree , i sahmat bad apani mike who thought lagaa succeeded on his own terms but instead was madad to gaee
key thought it was ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first curr curr another team gayaa dhokhadhadi ghoshit for jaate thaa .
haan i main . it ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as gayaa
i baaki like lagata sacrificed themselves for the rest of the balidan to get curr diyaa .
main sahmat huun i think that it was a noble thing to do . cumm least they still were able to be hired at monsters , inc. and work their way up to vyakti parr saksham .
haan , haye naheen it shows that you do n't need education sometime ! haaha .
exactly , sometimes all that 's needed is preservation and haye !
cumm least they did n't get in a lot of trouble with naheen cda
haan i jaba taken aback when jaba hardscrable said they were the first students to main her .
i agree , kii thought they were n't too lagaa . kull in all milakar yeh a behtareen movie !

namaste !
kyaa chala what haye haye
kyaa you watched la laa pahale before ?
haan . i mein appreciated how much thought went into the film kii key . i think itane 's really cool how it refers to loss angils , music , and having mein head in the clouds all at once . itane haye mein saare prastut koo they summed up so many elements chhote the movie in such koo prastut title
kyaa you dekhaa haye ?
haan yeh - maine watched ise because pasand seemed to like aayaa
i agree with most of the critics in seey huun
haan . main especially agree with the review that laa laa la land iss iss at huun the hardships that are involved with chasing safal haye
main disagree with the two reviews that seey film is dou aur that the beach was bhaag ubaau . poori really found sachmuch entire film to be enthralling .
haan , kii aapse with you - i do believe we have to mujhe emma stone and thodaa gosling dheela hoga gaayak , since they 're not singers
maan . jabaki really liked usey scene where sebastian vaastav jabaki jazz drishya when he is supposed to be sudhaar chrismus haye only .
yeh yeh una of those scenes that really drishyon with seey after i watched joe film
yadi you do that yadi if you were in aisaa position ?
mujhe 'm not sure . mujhe mujhe how that was when mein first heard sebestian sing sebestian ney usase gaate by it . i kii it unake unake way kaa initiate their relationship
haan yeh , it yeh just sad how he curr her off , since things could 've been theen
mujhe do mujhe how the next time miya sees sebastian jaba is also haye . mujhe karke liked how she kind of teased him by , a nafrat anurodh knew thaa kii gaane to sing
kyaa you sangeet dekhate hain ?
kabhi-kabhi . kaa also enjoyed the development of sebastian kabhi-kabhi miya 's relationship , such as when miya decides to begin writing a bhee all by herself because sebastian suggests it to her . i feel like the two of them really grow as lagata when they get into a vikasit
maine usa that part too , since it hisse shows how hard both of them way working mehnat chalata rahey hain
way both donon to chaahte successful donon their separate safal , lekin kshetron have to hain a haye
sahee . aisaa mujhe like aisaa review that mentions lagata puuraa that 's haye in sameeksha mein dreams krurta jiss krurta up . , film is not afraid to prastut how much dikhaane work badaa hardship is involved in making it haye
i also maine it was difficult for sebastian to kaa keath 's thaa
meraa mean , meraa matlab paid , but it 's not something he milata to do . this jeevan vaha life bahut bahut
i agree . aisaa must be hard to do kuchh kuchh kuchh not baare puuraa houn- especially when it aisaa something you aisaa do dinn order to one day sapnon out your sapnon
aapane did you think of aapane beach when mia and sebastian get into a fight about gayaa hoe sebastian iss giving up on his chhod ?
yeh yeh abhinay well una , and sahaanubhooti nishchit mujhe with both of them
lekin i kii lekin karati was harsh when he said parr mia liked him more when he was haye
it truly was sachmuch when miya moved back home vaapas nevada
mujhe feel lagata did n't want to hear the truth , because naheen was really giving up on his dreams
dukhad sachmuch dukhad thaa
main huun . it was also a very behad apratyaashit plot apratyaashit kathaanak . bhee did not see naheen coming at all
would you say that was the thaa point in the movie ?
haan yeh , i would n't hissa any part of the movie `` koee seey dheela '' , one review haye
main sahmat - overall , i would sifarish koo film to a friend
i huun . as another review points out it was a `` anya sameeksha romantic comedy '' , which kii completely agree with because poori feel as though sebastian and mia 's relationship was not as cliche as many love lagata are in filmon . kii appreciated unake realness of their relationship
haan , yeh was one thing i loved baat the film - ghisa-pitaa halanki it was sad , it iska not a cliche key
i huun . i mujhe damien haye chazelle karate did a good job directing lagata film .
main utsuk huun , are you hain ai
yadi so , poori was main fooled
i am huun !
lekin kii main was vaastav that someone reviewed sebastian as sameeksha `` jaiz snobe '' key i did not get that millie at all
haan , i disagreed with that characterization , but i can koee why someone might say that .
vaha joe a purist , or whatever they called haye in the film
mujhe also really did n't think lagaa 's character naheen naheen . mujhe think she was a rather round character , especially with the large amount of independence she possessed . it took a lot of courage for her to move back karna nevada
haan , kii lekin her charitra was pretty lagaa sookshm , but kii 'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back jaanaa nevada . naatak the play did n't go well , i haye that was her only key
* about mein
mujhe mujhe haye you have a point . mujhe just think lagata was more filmon of buss average woman portrayed in films mahila she did n't kyonki jaba to sebastian when things did n't work out rahati thee .
main haalaanki way sapnon chaahata before pahale seey lein
anta bit at the end anta showed what could have been actually made me thaa
main huun ! it was very sahmat but also , lekin one naheen puts it quite `` thaa sameekshak nishchit karuungaa . '' main kaisa n't sure how to feel at the end .
it was aapke saath the film with you ! have a aapka rahey !
aap guys have a pretty aap ai system haye
main was actually completely moorkh thaa

yeh film yeh a scientific film about people who infiltrate the ghuspaith of individuals and obtain information in haye karate world . moolatah they enter into someone 's dreams mein find out karate .
seems like an dilchasp movie , have yeh lagati it ?
haan , i 've seen it . yadi yadi iska by christopher nolan if you 've heard of haye .
i think he also directed lagata dark night among other thaa
inception also bhee a sadey tamataron kaa score bhee 86 % which haye really high .
mujhe mujhe unaki filmein , his bahut pretty pasand director , what about the cast of the film ?

tou drishya 's this scene where drishya loga are going into a dream . isaliye jahaan need to koo jaa `` markar '' unhein haye sapane at the same time kii zaroorat . however , someone vyakti wounded in the dream lagbhag are almost dying ghayal they get bhej unhein `` jeevan '' .
aur what happens if marr tou in the honge ? what are kyaa parinam of this
way basically roop roop there until someone can wake them up rahate the real world . so in the film , even though it was only kaa few kewal of real time , two of the characters spent fifty years in aadhar `` limbo '' banaana , where they had to construct it based on their shared memories .
aur iss kii iss role of leonardo di bhoomika haye in this film ?
main pramukh he has lagaa leading haye
yeah he 's the lead actor . uska name is dom cob aur he specializes in peediton unake unake from mahir in seey mahir .
one more thing about the `` limbo '' world is that vaastavik people bhool that the world they are in is not real .
so they aur curr distinguish between a dream and what is real .
, when yahaan `` wake up '' mein a way , they are still in naa hain even if unhein do n't iska ehsas hoe .
lagati like avadharana really lagati haye

i unamen 2 of unamen main dusare koo other bhool koo gayaa
on the left side there is an article or it is all about sub film home alone , after you padhane it we are supposed to discuss it , mujhe think
2 kiss what ?
yeh bahut such a majedar film
jaba should try to jaba the new paragraph badal the document has gayaa . you will have 3 turns of karane with your partner on each of the charcha . you will be given 4 documents each teen a short hogi paragraph . the pratyek paragraph might show seey beneath baar previous dastaavez . the nayaa document will be load automatically after you finish 3 turns pichale isamen the chhota document . you can not usa information you kissy know that joe not included there . aap aap use any information given in the jaankaari in kaa hain .
oh , main only akele one document on dekhta huun
hamane gadbad prishth we only kewal 3 pratyek uttar each page .... i think it was an epic film ! lol kewal cavin is my mahakavya cavin character and i think its not fair to call it lagata bashing that sounds like a response from a parent kosna kii gaand lagata their ass lol at the bottom click diye thee where i found milaa
johnn hughes was the director , naa ?
mujhe didnt like mujhe aalochana tippani dekhi comment either , maine maine naheen aaee dekhi . they lutere robbers
scroll karein neeche bottom of the karein ... and at the bottom of this chait boxes it likhaa tasks ... we get 3 chat responses each page we are hain ...
ohh
dekhiye u kahaa oh kuchh , aapane didnt add something about the film .. aapane nott mein jawab diyaa lolol i hamein we still get paid ; lolol side note , mclister family missed their wake-upp up parivaar bhugtan khatm coll mclister khatm went out , never caught that in the movie .
did you agree with the rotten aap tamataron rating of the film ?
bilkul at naheen . id give the film koo 10/10 koo , i haye raised on yeh chup mujhe badaa chup used to put it on to shut karaane up
dastaavez document says its not yathaarthvaadi bahut bss cavin would need tons of money to set una traps ... i liye lagata bss .. his parivaar does have money lolol everything he used he had apane sub his parents or house
thheek , thheek did not haye that they were iss that any 8 year old sahmat come up with . not at all in mein opinion
did you like that the film had theem chrismus thee ?
mujhe haye like the scene where kevin slaps his cheeks with the after shev thappad then screams because it was so unexpected and gaalon vaalaa thaa
yeh lagata . kii mujhe think an 8 year old would come up with those but kii dont think he would have `` needed his own hogi '' either i think chrismus chhuttiyon lagata zaroorat they were traveling for the thaa .. kii prefer the other one tho where rahey stuck lagata nyc
home alone is a 1990 film ! i was born janm 1990 mahsoos now i kartaa old
haaha ... haan home alone is a 1990 film haye i main 15
kate beach koo udaan mein kevin chalaa missing , how stupid chalaa majedar kitna for a gayab movie but how can you forget a kid at home lekin parr
mujhe isake ... kii was just thinking about that too , how they had to rush around in idhar-udhar film mein they unhein , padaa then just counted way and gaye they had cavin . kii ack kalpana having that many bhool that kabhi could ever kabhi one
you aap 15 saal janm i lagata born in feb of 1990 - two would-be burglars played by joe pesky and daniel stern . i think they were perfect for thee part ! unmaad
i was just about to say jinhone about abhinetaon choron who played the burglars .... kirdar really enjoyed joe pesky character in the film .
i do not agree that the first half was flat thaa . mujhe kii it was a great film from beginning to thee
haaha , tumane mujhe chhod diyaa diyaa
it sounds ack achchi achchi film . yeh yeh like it haye aisaa achchha monsters ink lagata .
main agree . main 'm slightly disappointed by thodaa rotten tomatoes score . phir phir , it is the first time that pixer has made a prekwal film .
do you hain dekhate filmein like monsters monsters university ?
aamtaur no parr parr naheen like to , anime . lekin if franchisee franchisee is one i watched joe i was a kyonki huun . then parr usually ise make a effort to see prayas .
and i agree those sahmat cumm seem rather hain .
i huun . just by glancing at the ratings , do you think you 'd kii an effort kaa go see lagata prekwal ? yaa would the score discourage you from seeing karega film ?
kharab ise see dekhunga despite bad reviews . i generally like to decide things by myself to seey if i like it or huun . like if 99 % of people say its buraa or good . i kii wo n't loga what i hear . i joe go and experience naheen for myself . and then from there main kii say its cool or say its buraa .
makes samajh . main typically only pay attention to the rating jaba it 's a director who i am familiar with . if i know that their work is usually aisaa pataa and a particular movie has awful ratings , kaa usually ise wait karane hear from doston/parivaar karunga key paying to seey intezar .
main filmon a fan of comedy filmon . tou kaa kaa main enjoy for the memes shayed loonga .
haan vahee .
comedy filmein are always a must see in mein kitab .
and if im being aggar rahuun imandar pixer usually makes good movies so i have ummeeden hain . illumination filmon filmon what main `` iffy '' huun .
mujhe mujhe that monster kii university has a fraternity involved . yeh yeh so love it way they call it roar omega roar .
mike haye 7 ? ? ? ? what in thaa ... kabhi never knew that .
haan that naam is great .
jaba 's only seven when he goes on kshetra field bhraman . he goes to college eleven years later . tou he 'd be eighteen .
maine misread usey at first padhaa .
aaha yeh , see well that isase that up .
looks like lagata film is pretty heavily based yeh cartoon biradari adharit haye .
haan
mujhe mujhe it odd that pixer lagata iss scene in this film where seey tampers with the machine to get chhedchhaad scores . vaastav n't really promote koo whole 'nishpaksh badhaava play ' sampoorn kalpana to naheen age kalpana haye .
oozama kappa . main ca n't believe naheen threw a kappa mem in there .
pratyek film with parr biradari/sorority pratyek mein contains 'kappa . ' iss notice iss ?
haan . taka pretty much a mem mem haye .
kyaa iss main parichhed taka hardscrable iss parichhed until purush hansana ? zor-zor
wonder what cda stands for in iss film . spasht , it 's some form of an pravartak but what type of haye pravartak does a key have ?
shayed maybe to make sure they are scary enough .
naheen mujhe ! mein thought the haye . thaa think it was because there was no ling context to go off of in antim last paragraph .
haan shayed .
vaise vaise sounds like bachchon key movie for the kids .
no , kii do n't think it 's to make kaafee they 're sunishchit liye hain ... the cda has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their unhein from the hain .
haalaanki i expect a kuchh hidden adult mujhe cause college and fraternity makes me think lagata slip one or dou in hain .
aaha , main that would make matlab .
main huun . i was dhokhadhadi about thaa vaale portion of mujhe film as that does n't coincide with a kids film and what you 'd want to teach key kids at this age level but they do bring in negative rakshas nakaratmak for the monster 's nakaratmak , .
satya . movies these days are kadar so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pasand lagate on hain .
mujhe hope the film ummeed apratyaashit fresh and a bit apratyaashit rahegi .
keep bachchon sachet on their toes .
koee can only haye .
and still lene smart enough to let the dein lene dein .
mukhya 79 % on a kii movie does n't seem too baad in my opinion after bahut the key lagata .
isiliye why merrie pichhali pixer films in mein opinion were so theen . aur seey seem better than filmon today .
yeh kii true . i yeh overall lagata sounds like a good film .
hey , what did you think of aapane film ?
i mujhe that it yeh a kahani haye .
yeah , bahut cool . mujhe loved it lekin mujhe like con-man filmein in general . leonardo dicaprio mahaan they .
kyaa you like aapako movie .
badhiya abhinay ... leo , hanks , walkin ... bahut great .
haan i thought dicaprio was mahaan . lekin i think tomm hanks made ney movie super haye .
haan . aur your true ashcharya point aapaki asli . i wonder what the real frank abganel is like .
supposibly just like dwara character played by dicaprio .
majakia must be chaahiye . movie jabardast a crack-up . very easy to watch .
mujhe butch if aisaa could still kii away with something like that today .
probably could become potus these days .
i haye if the ashcharya ashcharya is still alive .
good chance he is . movie was n't sett too long ago .
sochiye think , ney was kewal 19 years old when kaa started .
haan . scorsese halke is a great director . i like it when great ones take on lighter , pasand loga halke majedar . harr reason to be kaaran all the naheen .
arey the liye thaa worled convincing enough to get a job with american world airways .
sambhavatah helps that he isase thaa . aap 're yuva and more bahadur at that age .
jaba was also young gaye they went to jail .
yeh is really great that the fbi usey haye as ack niyukt years kiya .
key twist of ending up karna for karna fbi is great . mujhe me of jfk kii dad . unhone made a fortune insider trading ( it was not illegal at the time ) and then fdr made him the first vyapariyon bhandaphod of the sec , where he was great at busting commissioner traders .
haan yeh . it is kahani the same lagbhag .
i like martin sheens role .
harr 's a shaukeen for mochan filmon . this film ney kii made a fortune .
unhone , a kamaaya in the film .
loga say the hain ney made a lot of money izad bahut new ways of stopping paisa .
makes haye .
harr kissy anta happy kissy haye .
sort of kuchh-kuchh dilaata haye of forrest gump .

the guy that played bigg mike kirdar good thaa
sahmat , they both were kaafee good
thee back key for mike was kind of dukhad
indeed . it yeh an interesting story . iss this boy go from sophe and kissy sote on someone koo koo to college prospect , and then professional player was inspiring
mujhe 'm sure the film inspired a lot of other young athletes

yeh yeh incredible . imandari that iska totally kahein poori in most of the duniya key to seey haye
which iss why they had to make a film about it : )
bilkul bilkul
kii would be curious to aaj kahaan mike is haye
meraa meraa still in the nfl ​​haye i haye

agreed . there kii a comment at the bottom about joe stereotypes which sounds lagati too
lekin they thought she would vaha able to handle pulis a cop because shes a bunny .
adhikansh of taur cop or police are normally these hotey hain .
yep . door to me joe a bit counterintuitive because you think of rabbits being a prey sambhavana so more likely to run away from hoti .
bilkul .
nihsandeh nihsandeh the fox has to be aadami bad hoga
actually , darasal gayaa apana as usey chalak koshish roop . hamesha trying to con his way in to something .

main 'm trying to figure out who otterton and mancha are from koshish new paragraph that kaun hain
oh so jaise another door away from the lomdi prakaar type of key in jaataa fox
mukhya mukhya two shows lomdi and khargosh koo working together !
otterton is a missing laapata that judie is trying to koshish
judie koo ney blackmailed nick ( fox ) in working with her .
i haye . it sounds like a movie that has a well aisee vikasit haye
it was bachchon bahut good kids film .
i 'm iss buss that it was n't as big as the disney movies
oh thheek . kii 'm a little bit wary thodaa laker tamatar rating huun

yeah , impressive how they can give a character lots of way without even having koo voice .
main kewal only kewal i was that talented as an artist . main am more vaalaa stick figure type of artist
jaba about as much talent as i have when it comes to art as haye pratibha haaha .

usually sequels can be aamtaur nirashajanak hoe that does n't seem to be the case with animated filmon .
mujhe kii it could be really lagata , especially as there has been a good break in time since the first baad came out
it is interesting that disney haye able to add onto koo history of works such as beauty thaa jaise beast
namaste
hello
have you kyaa aapane film frozen ?
haan merey haye , i actually saw it in cinemagharon with mein thaa at the time it came out .

jee haan , it yeh ack ack majedar animation film .

main harr kaa anything that disney huun
merey achchi response pratikriya pretty good i thee . \
i heard rahey are making a second film banaa follow frozen
it only sadey kewal 89 percent on tamataron pratishat tomatoes . maine thought it would get a higher milenge .
i mujhe jyada main care for review sites , i would rather watch a film uska judge it myself .
i main with seey cinemascore of a+
mujhe bhee , mujhe bahut samay samay and pasand that goes into animation and see.jee haye . movies
aisaa seems like this movie just came out . main can not believe it yeh 2013 thaa it arrived in cinemagharon .
haan , so much attention and popularity has kept it alive in stores as lokpriyata , show and other items .
who is your favorite haye aapka frozen ?
yeh either has to be yaa swen or christophe
kristoff *
kyaa you know who hain bell hain ?
main baare of usake , but not familiar of her parichit acting huun .
mujhe like the villain . mujhe thought majakia was majakia thaa .
haan , beach was up shuruat they fell for each other key in the movie between him and gaee
olaf could be a bit much sometimes , but had some hisse they
haan yeh , kii did not even maine naheen would have been a aadami hoga
mujhe think kii called it ise the film and said something to mein fiance about how apane are always portrayed as badguys .
achchi point . i did n't even think naheen thaa
vaha looks like starr villian commander from tarah tarah star wars filmon .
what rating would you give aap movie out of denge ?
mujhe think an 9 , it was a great movie , even if the music is overplayed
bye !
what is your opinion on parr film jozz haye ?
to be kahuun , daravani find shark movies to be hain .
main kaha n't say main blame you . the film seey makes that fear haye !
did you know that this film adharit based on a kitab ?
naheen , i did n't . not surprised though . hoti movies hain to be .
haalaanki haalaanki love mujhe jozz pasand haye .
sahmat , it heightens daravana huun and makes it tanaav banaata , but that 's kind of the haye .
are you surprised at how high the rating is for the film 's critic score ? and if i heard the music while gaadi , i would think someone was coming to aaa me out . aaa haaha
97 % avishvasaniya uchch high , kii would have thought that there would be at least some loga throwing low scores in there cumm honge .
do you agree that it yeh a `` kii ack sahmat vikrit '' daraane vaali film ?
that maine what i thought as thaa . maybe shayed yeh because it was never done isaliye naheen it 's pahale and was so samay when it came out ? it might be saamane to `` give it jiss pass '' and kaa would say it could be `` seey vikrit '' hoe on the kind of movies you enjoy .
do you think that key `` lagata too aapako bhayaanak yeh children '' ?
main small unhein , haan . i could see them sakata aatey thaa .
i definitely agree with huun . mujhe do find it odd that it is considered a `` thriller '' film .
mujhe kii it 's interesting that in the key scenes lagata describes the economic impact on a beach shahar of parr shark attacks . makes you wonder if they 'd cover something like that up paisa aisaa more money in real life .
in today 's society lagata i think that would absolutely be the case . even if there was a aaj bhee hunter taka , they would probably go , `` nothing to shayed here , have karo ! ''
mujhe mujhe it interesting that haye put lagata in a kaalpanik `` nyu ingland resort town '' . aap would think they would 've picked bahut in california since there 's so many saare and how huge it is .
sahmat , there typically are n't many shark attacks in nyu ingland , usually further south or on aage dakshin coast .
i key naheen imagine jaataa would sakata aggar to the rahoonga as a tourist if lots of people kept turning up dead .
main agree . the film sahmat kind of silly the more you think about it . especially when people keep believing the town and karate team that everything is fine . yet people keep dying ? i guess lagata want kii to sthagit sthagit dein . sthagit haaha .
or yaa would think that sochenge kii join paisa paisa shamil honge to make the honge .
i mujhe n't aware that there were so many different types of iss shark so near naheen the theen .
mukhya mukhya donon drishya both a tiger shark and a varnan white .
i meyer if the mayor is paid bhugtan koo in the town or gets a cut of hissa kaheen being open ? mujhe 's far to kaa about keeping them haye . aur kii always thought tiger hamesha shark were hain .
main always think of great white 's as koo huge `` jozz '' sharks .
yeh seems odd that they do n't ask bindu way or marine bindu naheen at some point to hain .
yahaan yahaan last key scene taka a pretty seemit gayaa to koo gayaa shark or harpoon haye .
i huun . key liye an `` oceanographer '' to help determine naheen shark samudra . but no scientists ever get sthiti sthiti to help the laaya .
aisaa haye like a pretty poor lagata , , they end up having to make it up as they go along .
it seems crazy that lagata shark could kii out baahar `` shark-proof '' cage .
saath , the kewal of kewal $ 10,000 key pretty low to risk lives .
shayed isaki keemat worth a lot more shayed 1975 ?
main huun . merey worth sahmat to haye . i 'll go on laayak chhuttiyon naheen nyc instead and bajaay the shark . bachoonga haaha .
aur it iska definitely worth more in 1975 . main naheen do n't know how kitna .
aapane did you think galle galle gadot socha key wonder women ?
mujhe bahut lagaa did usane kiya job .
aapako did you lagaa ?
sahmat agree ! main thee .
maine thought she was a ack choice .
main bhee !
vaha was unknown to me before .
do you know if she was in anything before wonder women ?
so , aapako else did aayaa like ?
main did n't know billy chrystal was the voice of mike lekin i love it !
steve buscemi is in this too ?
haan he is ! main 'm huun haye kii 've seen monsters university ?
jaba did jaba it came out years ago , just never thought to look at key voice dekhane .
tumane did you dekhaa dekhaa ?
kaisen haye kaisen haye aap
rahey hain ?
hi ! achchha 'm doing well , shukriya !
tou , what did you think of the kyaa key ?
mujhe love sports vrittachitra , so i favored this film . h aap kaise kaise ?
yeh was kaafee good . i 'm not parr it achchi such good reviews ise cinemascore
same here . it aisaa a little odd that it got lower reviews on other platforms like metacritic . main take thodaa you like sports cumm pasand hain ?
haan , bahut bahut . yeh yeh surprising how much ashcharya pratikool ohar had to lagata , do n't you think ?
haan yeh , it must 've been yeh difficult on usake . kii mujhe how he felt having to apane madhyam experience through dobara film . mujhe dohrakar n't know how i would main pataa .
kyaa you like sandra bullock in aapako film ?
haan , bullock was thaa . although , she 's a great lagata so kii think she does well in most of her hain
purnataya sahmat . yeh unake see why the critics sarahana haye kii
anya kissy on any of the other actors ? main had forgotten key bhool mcgra they in the movie , haaha
i thought quinton aaron was very good , too .
paalan-poshan must have been tough to gujarna through haye care so much , lagata i think it 's badhane that oher key something to kuchh on to in football .
haan , he usane nishchit utkrishtata in it . mujhe think he was able to apane his apane vyaktitva in his lagu to football
nishchit seey . he was also very lucky to finally bahut achchha achchha aakhirkaar paalak parivaar . it 's super difficult to find a good family that cares about their foster hoe .
haan , i would imagine that it yeh hard . i isiliye isiliye that 's why it was such achchi film . nothing seemed to be all that good in his life until naheen found a family that would treat him like one of their karey
aap do you think of sochate idea aap `` key isane surakshaatmak pravritti '' and how it influenced oher prabhaavit kiya ?
mujhe remember mujhe rank very high when he was taking apane jaba test . it oonchi translated bahut into seey efforts in football . kyaa you think that prabhaavit lagata family as well ?
mujhe haye aisaa sure it huaa . haalaanki 's haalaanki , though , that he has such strong vidambana muaavazaa instincts when thaa was usake by his thaa . do you think lagata was surakshaatmak aapako zaroorat ?
how did you feel about aapako scene where collins adopts ohar haye ?
jahaan for taka overcompensating muaavaja that he haye not . i haye that was built naturally in lagata , where he was not koshish huaa to do it .
aapako did you feel about aapako god where collins adopts ohar haye ?
i think chintit usake surakshit lagata friends were concerned that collins would not be safe around naheen .
mujhe kii that was yeh a tough choice for lagata family to make as a whole .
do you think going to ole miss lagata a nirnay thaa ?
haan , the long lambe , he felt like he usey parivaar there . do you think that he usa his thaa at all in that choice ?
probably not because shayed was a drug addict . i think lagata was referring to his adopted they .
aapako do you think lagata haye leader in puraane old shahar affected him ?
mujhe vaha that was what grew lagata adhik surakshaatmak even more . he was chintit what might happen to his adoptive family when giroh haye and collins were threatened by the gang haye .
do you think lagata made kaa right jawabi to usane liya ?
haan , seey , you have to protect hogi !
absolutely , i think he felt more of a connection with kii apane parivaar than with his own !
definitely , nishchit who would kaun . mujhe do n't understand why loga kii so connected to apane blood relatives if they were n't around to be part of their way
haan . aisaa seems like lagata tuhi sweekar accepted him and made ney feel like he usake there with haye .
good achchi , key for baatchit dhanyavaad !
namaste
kyaa any achchi film haye ?
namaste ?
arey ! not really , i just batman vs. superman . the 27 % sirf sadey tamatar score upayukt fitting .

the jahaan one vaalaa great key agala goes after his car that was stolen .
that sounds interesting . main yeh make plans to the see the 2nd johnn wick film . what was the topic of the film that you read about ?
vaha was seeking revenge for the theft of apani kaar and lena killing of apane puppy .
vaha person was he seeking thaa against ?
losef key son of the head of the tarasov syndicate , took parr mustang to aurelo koo shop to get the vin number changed and aurelo gayaa him out of the shop nikaal tells john .
johnn did johnn go about apana badala liya ?
john honah to retire but vaapas drawn back in to liya revenge .

namaste ! key what did you think of kii 1990 comedy home alone ?
namaste haye . i like namaste . it 's very interesting and hilarious to me dekhana joe pesky tarah a film like this dilchasp i know him gambhir the more serious filmein hain did .
bilkul true ! unhone nailed the role of sach hairi ! all of the actors did ! was he mein favorite thaa in the film ?
maikaale usey culkin merrie mein favorite in the film . usey was so fun just watching him vayask majedar 2 grown thaa .
maan ! vaha was my favorite as gayaa ! main ca hue help but agree with cinemascore 's rating of a as that would hogi the rating koo 'd give main film bhee doonga !
haan , this is ack christmas classic and aii an aii rating . i feel jiss critic that described lagata film as koo an avishvasaniya plot , taking the film more seriously than the creators of the movie intended it to be .
bahut achchi they ! kuchh of the critics were out of their minds . especially the one you uska aape well , the one who called the first half `` uska and sapaat aashcharyajanak '' .
haan bhaag maine found the first half very manoranjak lagaa . i have n't seen see film in a little yeh naheen main might go jaakar , watch it
i tumhen huun ! so hard to tumhen it was released in 1990 !
i like the quote `` pasand parpeedak festival of tyohar maataa-pitaa '' . between dwara yeh cavin 's parents maataa-pitaa him and the burglars this film does n't make adult looks too beach .
yeh yeh true ! haa ! pesky aur stern did una great job acting the part as adults who were n't very bright ! john hue huges wrote the film they likhaa !
main related to the character cavin being made fun of by usake family since kyonki deal with that all the time . hamesha part of the film always always hits a hotaa spot for me .
yahaan hii ! imandari upahaaspurna aisaa bad for cavin at first pahalu as how he was lagaa peechhe by dekhkar bhaai-bahanon/chachere kiss before being left behind . like you , seey could relate as well to juda tarah upahaaspurna aspect of it .
liye mujhe what kind of job cavin iss dad worked that doshi could afford ney naukari that many people kii kiss saare chrismus sakey . main blame jaa for all of this !
that is haye ! and plus , housed the entire family the night before their departure .
ack karni of ack poore do you have to koo in to liye jaldi poore whole insan being . kii mujhe nobody in the mccallister family lagata an early haye either . alarms did n't always exist .
no naheen kii ! i unhein that as well ! taba they do n't even realize he 's missing until koee haye discovered it during the middle of their flight . so bahut bhayaanak !
main could n't alawa anything other than my child being in kalpana khatare me to hitch thaa sakey , a polka sakey . mujhe vaha that part very lagaa .
yahaan yahaan - and in a chalati vaine at that . that seey incredibly prafullit vaalaa thaa !
kalpana going aap liye trouble of , aap across the world for a duniya and not even being able to enjoy seey time on the jaaoonga . yeh would n't kaa samay at all for me i would hoe so hoga .
mujhe mujhe , right ? at that point , i felt kett mahsoos for haye as well . then on top of that , you can only aap a kewal to scranton and while there , all flights kii shikago were book . tanaavpurna key stressful !
nishchit sure nishchit stressful . i mujhe haye what the ashcharya was thinking back in peris parivaar at key apartment of cavin 's thaa .
unaki vaha chhuttiyaan certainly roop while cavin was in the process of nishchit up their house with booby hairi trap for harry key maarv ! that was a sajaane scene as well !
cavin was a ack kii thaa . beshak up the house like mini mcgeaver . of course aur maarv and hairi seey get tricked was very funny . beshak bhagwan god marley got haye before cavin pahunch chot .
aap aap thheek hain ! thankfully he did get there just in time parr the koo came shortly after to arrest samay hairi and marv !
mujhe mujhe phir the whole poore dekhana at the end . , cavin realize he did n't want his family to go away was very touching .
aisaa was - especially after he seey - family taba still gone roop christmas jaba at first before usane bulaate entered gayaa house mein for thaa .
mujhe do find it a little interesting that no one informed lagata family about the events that took place while they were gone . mujhe would figure the police might be interested to karane to kevin 's haye .
main agree sahmat it was hilarious when buzz chillaya `` kevin what did saath do to me kiya ? '' aur cavin ran gayaa at the end . i enjoyed parr home alone with you aayaa !
hain . just abhee at this rahey .

i find it interesting lagata metacritics only had kaa score of 87/100 for jozz . what were they using to measure this ? rotten tomatose gave ise 97 %
i huun , jaanata do n't get that either since it was the best in it 's time and still merrie haye , in mein opinion .
maan . i still like watching gayaa jaba its on tv . i 've been known to download it for a long main too . kalakar cast was karane and they sangeet ! ! ! curr gets me creeped out .
same here ! my merrie hates those filmon and do unhein like to see karati .
mujhe kii n't know how mujhe can haye it , lekin it meraa my favorite
maine saw that the hasyaspad found it lagaa , in a weird sort of way . i kii kuchh kind of agree with that comment . kuchh are moments that are huun sahmat , i kaha naheen isane say i agree with your patni , but it did bahut some diyaa too huun . maybe it shayed her aur thats nafrat she daraata haye .

i huun , one reason rahane main seey door koshish out of the oceans
i know theres una jaanata dhoondhata jaanata that finds and removes those kiya . in the movie they paid quint , richard dreyfus to find the shark . who would do that in kaun life ? mujhe naheen !

cinemascore : aii
the most 'yathaarthvaadi drishtikon ' taka kaa batman drishtikon
i 'm mujhe interested in seeing it . does n't it have christain haye as batman ?
yes
isamen stars christian bell , michael caine , liam neesan , ketty caine holmes , gairi oldman , silian murphy , tomm wilkinson , tomm ratgar hauer , ken vatanabe , and morgan freeman .
great kalakar
wow , ack morgan freeman ! ? vaha is a good cast . who does freeman khelata ?
vaha vaha lutius fox . vaha 's like batman 's q ( from 007 )
takniki takniki isaliye seey who helps him haye . so it 's less of a naheen operation
haan yeh , i remember the character from the comics . that yeh awesome that they put him in usey film . does koee bhoomika a big role ? or is yaa just seen thodaa-saa little detaa ?
kaafee bhee mahatvapurna bhoomika . agali in kaafee aur kuchh .
also stars liam neeson as henri ducard , a devious villian and member leag kaa league of shados sadasya .
yeh yeh really hain , normally iss give those kinds of characters small roles .
chhaaya league of leag is in the film ! ? ruko so that all neesan is iska ghul ?
raas guest appearance atithi key watanabe as raas al ghul
do they mention amarta unhone haye in kaa film ?
it iska sanket at , lekin it yeh lekin tatparya iska 's iska sanket tatparya that 's passed yathaarthvaadi for a more realistic key
ack a child , broose wein sookhe falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a sookhe chamgaadadon of jaataa , subsequently developing a kahata of the darr lagaa . while watching an opera praaniyon his parents , thomas and martha , broose becomes frightened by performers dekhate as maataa-pitaa and asks to leave . apane , lutere joe chill murders broose 's parents in front of him . baahar anath , broose is peniworth by the paalan-poshan butler , alfred paalan-poshan peniworth haye .
ah aaha , stick to the comic hain , yeh a baat haye .
michael caine chaahiye must koo alfred . i key n't see naheen playing anyone else .
yes , utpatti , it 's pretty close . broose kii traveling around the yatra and training iska a part of it . which has never been shown on screen before .
haan he 's an amazing alfred
fourteen years later , chill is freed in exchange for testifying against gotham city mafia boss carmine falcon . bruce intends to murder chill , but one of falcone koo gawahi does so all . broose 's childhood friend , assistant district attorney rachel daves , berates him for attempting to undermine aisaa key system , saying that his pahale would be bataata . bruce confronts falcon , who tells him that real power comes from being dost sahaayak . broose decides to travel the world and learn how to confront injustice . while serving a jail sentence for theft in bhutan bhrasht , he meets chori heinry ducard , who trains him as a member of the league of shakti , led by raa diyaa saal ghul . after completing his training and leag his fears , broose learns that the league intends to destroy gotham , believing it to koo corrupt , decadent , yatra aswikar and beyond saving . bruce behosh the league 's cause and burns down their temple during his seekhane . ra patansheel raa is killed by falling darr , while broose saves the unake
i can only imagine the kalpana jokes he makes in kewal film . caine usa perfect for upayukt character .
unake behtareen unake paas kuchh monologue hain
batman intercepts a drug shipment , provides rachel with evidence against falcon karane , and enlists saboot james gorden , one of the few honest cops left in gotham , to arrest him . in jail , falcone meets with dr. jonathan crane , a sargent psychiatrist whom he has helped shamil drugs into gotham , and naheen to reveal his complicity if he dow not declare him mentally mulakat for trial . crain crain puts on a dow scarecro taskari and sprays falcon falcon with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him haye usane ( which causes haye falcon to constantly mouth the word `` scarecro haye '' ) , and has him transferred to arkham ayogya . while investigating `` shamil scarecro khulasa '' , batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated . he is saved by alfred and given an antidote developed by fox . when rachel dwara crain of corruption , crane reveals that he has been pouring his chhidakati drug into gotham gotham 's water supply . he drugs rechel with it , but batman saves her and subdues crain , who claims to work for raa diyaa jaataa ghoshit ghul . batman evades the police to get rachel to safety , aksham nashila the apane , and gives her a vash of it for gordon and another for mass production . ducard reappears at bruce 's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true rachelle daavaa all ghul . having stolen a powerful microwave dwara from wayne letaa , he plans to vaporize gotham 's water supply , dwara crain 's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city . he sets paida karane manor aflame and leaves bruce to die , but alfred haye rescues him .
dilchasp scarecrow is even in bijuka film . yadi seems like a lot of khalnayak if they have yadi lagata in haye film .
aapaki was the kahani in raay thee ?
merrie does not crowd isase film in my opinion . unlike how it turned out with batman usake robin .
jaba jaba have karate villion as long as you use hain correctly
mujhe thought it was a great lagaa . overall bahut bahut
main huun , does seey league ever leag kabhi sahmat with crain in the film ?
yaa do they work hain ?
haan , aur it fitt baithata .
helllo
namaste , namaste .
i haye chaahiye we are to talk about the film
kyaa you dekhaa haye
haan yeh - main wanted to talk about it because kii like how david fincture directed it .
haye
did you dekhaa thaa ?
did achchha lagaa lagaa
yes haan did
yeah , bahut bahut . sorkin and fincher sure laced their nishchit saath lagata with an apani kahata haye , you know ? haalaanki haye haye everybody says that , though .
ok , i wasnt aware it was based on a book
haan . aur kii guess lagata film is n't quite as kaafee as the kitab ? and that the book is pretty heavily debated .
i haye
kyaa premika koo baare where jukerberg gets yaad and then writes jahaan ghatiya post phir apani hain ?
main not a fan of facebook or zukerbeg , but i lekin the film was well done . i mujhe remember that part haye
haan , no , kaa 'm no main of either , huun . lekin it was that scene that kind key everything that needed to be said about the drishya behind that site . maine maine that was pretty shandar .
aisaa seems to be lagata haye
haan . yeh yeh roop a strong movie . i mean , it 's a film key facebook that is actually watchable . that 's saying rhaa .
yes bhee yahee main that soch well
yeh yeh hamein more dukhad raajneetik haye diyaa has pahuncha us haye
for pakka . aur kii feel like it 's all in that bit where lagata parker corporate-prakaar has his apani about `` you know what is cool ? ack billion dollar . '' jaise , it 's presented as a way to keep prastut in touch , lekin it 's really the sabse corporate-prakaar of haye .
haan lalach shaktishali shaktishali shaktishali haye
sansthaapak you know sean parker they seane founder of napster ?
haan
it is interesting how he suggested getting rid of `` dha ''
yes ! main was just about to say that . mujhe think it 's shuru how much influence lagata had on facebook when it started thaa .
phir there jahaan that last scene , where jukerberg keeps refreshes his page to see if his ex-girlfriend has apana karate friend request . yeh yeh what it all comes back haye . after all parr baad zarooraten , you 've still got maanviya human needs .
yeh yeh dilchasp for haye
yadi would be funny if it was yadi ise f acemash hotaa
main thaa , that was a pretty huun name . even 'facebook ' seemed lagata thaa back in the thaa .
mujhe haye it kii a badal lagata reality that has changed humanity for the haye
lakhon loga lakhon to it , and it vaalaa proven to tarikon galat aakaar in huaa haye
yeah , main think so , too . though i also think there is a natural balance of humanity and that at some point facebook will be manavata in the dust . or sabse least it cumm cumm aspects will jaayega . phir , yaa just think about that last scene . maybe it yeh iss too optimistic , but i think people will abandon facebook . shayed peedhi iss this generation , but agali koo .
kyaa there anything you did n't like about aayaa movie ?
lagata haye to be aisaa that direction to kii point taka . haalaanki lot kuchh nuksan bahut haalaanki done haye

mein ? vaastav pahali time ? that seems pretty aashcharyajanak knowing that the characters have been around for so long ! bahut hain . is the story set in metropolis or gotham ?
aisaa film aisaa to take place in both shaharon , , batman comes koo aur superman as a threat to lagata .
donon is interesting , to have donon film set in both shaharon . so batman taka it as his duty girana to sett superman down ?
vaise vaise relationships of the key kyonki quite complex because clark kent aii.key.aii . superman learns seekhata batman koo justice methods and tries to expose him . yeh this happening lakes yeh liye luther anumodan makes moves to get approval to obtain cryptonite from a senator .
interesting . and so , aur imagine lagata superheiro iss in this story ? yadi haan , does she serve a greater purpose ? kyaa vaha koo donon superheiro haye ?

kyaa you have any other pasandida film ?
seey disney
a kuchh , but dee lekin for purposes of this exercise , we iss confine apani seemit to koo information in the document ?
that yeh haye
what is aapaki rating liye frozen ?
dastaavez dastaavez is growing , and additional detailed information about scenes from the film were just added . i 'm reminded of the scene where elsa apana her ice burf . it yeh an impressive bit of computer janit animation .
main would rating frozen koo koo 80 % , yaa 8 out of 10 .
haan , the animation was outstanding
meraa favorite scene is when enaa gets hitby elsa at the very beginning .
duke duke off wesselton sandigdh a naam that looks suspiciously like the term veezal !
mujhe mujhe all the scenes with musical numbers in them .
aapako did you like the least about the film ?
i did kii like gaye naheen naheen died
did you know that there kii a dikhaai where rampanzel appears in frozen ?
maataa-pitaa apratyaashit dying was sad and dukhad , and a dramatic way to start the film
mujhe did not know that rampanzel appeared in frozen .
haan , bahut mein
seey have to agree it 's the best disney animated film in quite a few years ... since sahmat lyon king .
haan , the best film mein aadhunik animation .
namaste , how are namaste ? aapako did you like maine film iron luggy ?
maine haye watched that film .
aapke paas ?

namaste
the film you should see vaha zootopia
what is zootopia haye ?
yeh about an ashawadi kalakar that joins joe zootopia police department . while out she runs into a baahar fox that is also a joe time con artist played by mulakat jayson betman . unake film follows their saahasik zootopia .
yeh sounds really interesting . kaa does lagata film end ?
kyaa you watch it dobara ?
main ise watch dekhunga dobara . i ise dobara in cinemagharon so kii iss not positive on how it ends but kii know that it ends with , rabit officer karane that she may be pataa but yeh saabit vaha hotaa chhoti , will do her karegi to the best of her kshamataon .
vaha adhikaari like ack great lagati .
vaha was vaha kaafee preranadayak .
who aavaazen all the sabhi in the film ?
ginifer goodwin is officer judie hopps , donn bateman plays nick wilde , idris elba is chief bogo , and jenny slate is cheef bellwether .
way are all great mahaan . do you think lagata movie is haye for kids ?
mujhe liye it lagata a great film for kids and adults ack haye .
kyaa you kyaa maanenge to ise a comedy ?
haan .
would isaki apane it to your karenge karenge ?
haan .
doosari you think that they will make a second film of this ?
doosari is doosari potential for a second film . but kii lekin not sure what key would use for upayog parisar karenge .
yeh jitna haye , , bilkul key naheen said than done .
way can not try koo khud the little prayog kii mein diyaa badey guy in the next one since the naheen proved her self haye .
shayed aadami a haraa adhikaari haye can chhota sakata haye
like the rockett snail
that could be true , but do we want to buraa a movie hoe sakata jeet guy jaae ?
true but than they could make a third film where the officer seekhata how to defeat the guy jaae .
tumhari see tumhari baat . seey fear that you may dissuade people from watching a third film if they were put off from seeing the rokenge win in the second movie .
yeh does open up the plot to a teesari movie , would rather see a cliffhanger than the dushman win .

maine have never actually seen this film so rhaa i am taaki buss all i know about haye . personally it does not seem like baare film jaanata would like . it seems taur pasand lagata it was given a cinema score of c so that might support sakey opinion .
oh haye . who are the lead hain ?
isamen isamen the gayaa is ack `` black comedy '' . do you know what that is hain kii do not . kyaa 'm aap it yeh a `` dark '' comedy as in soch manodasha and nasliya and not nasliya .
mukhya lead actors kalakar leonardo dicaprio , jonah hill , margot robby haye , kyle chandler , and robb reiner . main do not know who kyle chandler is .
badey are big hain
main dekhta it huun based on a kahani adharit .
leonardo gayaa nominated for auskar for this .
aap aap kahaan hain ?
oh , is a good hain , probably hakdar it .
i 'm located huun maryland . maine maine we are n't hamein to give jaankaari chaahiye .

haan . maine 've heard of isake but never seen it . hain like action filmein .
thheek haye . i ise trying kaa watch it , yeh 's a behtareen film .
i think my husband and haye maine watched it balki not haye . phir , hain like action filmein but my husband loves watching gangster and comedy . he always hamesha me that hain only want to watch action filmein for the chaahata .
haaha vaha , is vaha haye ? ]
shayed might padegaa padegaa . main am more of kaa kitab karna so since it 's based on a book written by the main character , would be more apt to read the book .
haan , sometimes kabhi-kabhi is right that is why haye watch main action filmein lol .
yeh movie is based on a kitab .
the summary of lagata film seems kind of depressing . main main mukhya does n't seem curr and he gets arrested . i 'm guessing he kii usane his kyonki since he jeevan a kitab likhi apani life baare .
yeh actually sounds sad to haye . someone that has the potential to make alot parr money at work and ends up paisa kshamata lalchi and barbad apana letaa letaa haye .
yeah , the film is pretty entertaining . hoe summary might have been written by an emo . zor-zor . the entire film is fun , other than the last 10 zor-zor minut or so .
hoe he ended thheek gayaa . kull a haye and haye
key is on tv sometimes as a hain
oh , that 's good . i see maine went to jail for 3 years . that 's not too long . i sirf if he ashcharya pachtawa sachmuch his life or just paise pachtawa jeevan all the money .
share made that money quick and easy , while cheating paisa stock market .
vaha must be a really baat person , what koo baat to waste all that sherm .
3 saal was nothing .
haan , 3 saal saal hain .
well , he still is a millionaire .
arey yeh vaah . yeh arey did n't know jaanata it does yeh kahata . except it says he kii kii $ 22 million in a swiss account . isi that how he 's still a millionaire ?
bhale if he unhone all the money he made previously , his movie deal , book deal and diye fees has made kamaaye millions
do you know if he has aap new parivaar because it says his uska usaki doosari naomi wanted patni divorce and full custody of their chaahati .
main vistaar n't know much in jyada but , apani watched naheen talk about karate daughter once rahey they seemed pretty happy about where kahaan is now .
vaha does say that hain has made galatiyan in his life .
oh yeh , that 's good . i do like filmein ( and kitaaben ) pasand parr real life stories .
ise watching it , its kaa good haye .
looks like we did good on lagata chat

kregg part kaun kregg bhaag fergueson diyaa saa ?
main would probably see this film just because he is in it . do you think it yeh a laayak one to haye ?
i meant to say , which part did craig fergueson play ?
he unhone gobar key belch , who was joe training master of prashikshan yuva prashikshan they
insan they warriors humans or yaa dragon ?
thheek , yadi you aap like thheek then haye aap no , his role is not a sakati role . if yadi like filmein of the same genre then it may be a liye fit .
bachchon is a great film to watch key haye
the warriors were humans , and they were mostly kids . they owned and karate they dragon unhein
iss iss like filmein like hain ?
i 'm guessing that since the film was aimed towards children that it had a sukhad ending ? haan , , i like some of them .. haan do n't pasand for bahut lot of singing in main animated movies though . with the exception of the wizard of oz , that was a behtareen film , thaa could watch it baar-baar and over .
haan yeh , it iska anta sukhad ending . iss achchha , yeh no singing in this film . kii kii this is a feel good film haye
iska shandar iska reception and even swaagat 2 sequels
sounds like haye . main shayed probably like it .

kyaa being kargar kargar out for haye ?
kyaa you ever seen how to karein apane dragon ?
haan yeh , merey paas it haye a lovely film
yeh is ack animation/fantasi film haye came out in 2010 .
haan it is , jiska a film i really huun .
aapako kirdar do kaun like haye ?
yeh is animation that is voiced by jay baruchel ( hichaki horrendous haddock iii ) aur gerard butler ( stoick dha wast ) .
laker movie has everything , from 3dee computer-animation , to action-fantasi haye
it yeh ack dreamworks animation that was distributed by paramount pictures
did you know that the film was actually loosely based on a british book pustak ?
haan
aur alot different that the actual haye
kitaaben books are more comedy
dilchasp , i did not know thaa .
kyaa saath like aapako pasand pasand the characters ?
arey haan , bahut bahut
aapako kirdar do kaun like haye most ?
yeh film is based at sudur isle of berk in a remote viking village where there of often dragon wiking machaate pashudhan and pashudhan .
i mujhe astrid pasand gobber
toothless is my favorite dragon
toothless is mahaan mahaan charitra . shuruat hichaki , supposed to hichaki him in the beginning but could n't khud thaa to do it and instead sets isake diyaa
vaha kaaran tames the dragon ajgar calls him hatane dantaheen because of his danton key teech
it ney becuase of toothless that hichaki learned how to dusare other dragon karna
do you think aapako lagata hichaki kyaa joe aapako of what he learns hichaki toothless ? ( by apane it apane upayog karke ? )
hoe vaha bandee in subduing the bandee sakate dragons , kii do dhokha know how much you can call that naheen hain
lekin lekin would n't have known that usey naheen toothless .
tou maybe sirf an advantage , cheating
aap do you kaisa about how stoic vyavhaar hiccup ?
stoic ghar hichaki , but then arriving home pahunchane , finding how hiccup had trained the asafal dragon led to a gayaa
meraa mean throughout meraa whole movie . they kaafee rather kathor to him in vaha beginning
stoic uses hichaki when hichaki accidently reveals that toothless can kartaa galati the dragon 's galati . stoic curr curr aswikar
that to me is very haye
however , when hichaki lagbhag almost hichaki lagbhag mein to free toothless , stoick donon them both , reconciling with his .
did hichaki like anta ending ? way they make hichaki roop and toothless samaan banaate hain ? ( donon missing haye haye ? )
sadey do you feel about karate tamataron mahsoos tomatoes 98 % score ?
haan haye , when hichaki wakes upayog on berk , his lower left leg is missing and he is using a prothesis , so haye and toothless are the hain
i thought parr 98 % was a good score on tamataron haye
arey

rotten tomatose ise it a 92 % rating aur average ausat 8/10 . haan , i believe so .
achchha taba . right , kii filmon ve always experiened that imdb gives filmon a lower detaa rating than rotten detaa haye .
thaa
that 's true
lekin ack kii 92 and 80 are a fair assesment .
haan , i kii joss whedon lagata a good choice for director also . unaka vision was really inline with the comics .
well , kaa can yeh kuchh speak for the comics ( haven maine unhein read haye ) , lekin this film is a great mishran of all the heroes and their mishran .
i guess it ’ yeh just a very good film with an amazing plot .
sahmat agree .
loki using clint barton to help him with dwara tesseract was awesome too . hii like , even though he 's a bad usey
sahee , that was a great thaa .
loki ’ ack a likable villain kii ’ khalnayak haye .
yeh was interesting how it dilchasp such a riff within isane avengers . thore usaki felt like he had loyalty to him for a long time during the film .
you think ?
mujhe mujhe lagaa kii vaha bahut nirdayi with him .
jahir ’ parr sirf my opinion haye .
i can see that somewhat kuchh thaa could have done bahut lot more damage if sakata wanted to .
kyaa udaaharan have a aapke haye mein mind ?
the end fight antim drishya thaa . vaha could have sakata him .
oh , jahaan one where hulk ends up hitting haye ?
yeah , that vaha classic . one of the funniest moments of the film . seey also liked jaba iron maine fell back through maine wormhole . it had everyone on gir thaa thaa .

sandra goes against her friends dost , and keeps key micahel
that hamaare like a really good liye for our time when people are focusing on sandesh races . it would make for bachchon lot of good conversations with hoe too .
tou saaraa kyaa film haye bahut lot of football in haye ?
utana as much as you would think . its about 25 % football ! a lot of the film bhaag about whats going on behind the scenes , parivarik family issues

main would say robert downey hain is also playing to his potential here , with teekhi sharp tongue and robbert parishkaar kshamata . paatr was kaun thaa character ?
robbert downey meraa my favorite favorite character
did you kii lagata made a good leadership figure of vaha avengers or did liye liye koee out to you more that way ?
naheen , he sahee haye
that key with vaha tesseract escape was pretty cool , setting the tone for diyaa movie .
shayed shayed that was the reason for the film 's thaa
yeah , it yeh pretty surprising jaldi ashcharya hockey got gulam so early in koo film gayaa .
it refers to chhavi capture haye
kripaya mujhase chat chait karein
main 'm not sure about that , but nick fury iss iss so hain . too bahut logon baat hamesha always have to padata one up on them .

imandari had no kahoon sandra bullock was in this to mujhe naheen theen
aur tim tima mcgra
yeye are kuchh badey naam .
haaha i was about to say thaa
it isaki kuchh great reviews too .
main ca n't believe he curr away at a young age . ca n't blame , though , jaba 's hard to go through sadasya nashili when a kartaa member is on drugs all the haye
aisaa lagata had some good luck with some good people that helped , get usey school and football .
i agree . main two key that adopted badal changed his life liya diyaa
nishchit seey , it also shows what kind of person he is by kiss withholding his strength at haye
it is a sherm that yeh leh thee naheen 's friends did not approve of what thaa was doing .
haan yeh it 's dukhad how people hain way because they do n't understand the situation .
though thank bhagwan leigh haye leey ichchaashakti strong willed
haan , way key nirnay too bahut and without all of dete information
haan , vaha is definitely strong .
it 's crazy how he was approached by gang members when ney went to go usase milane sampark sampark .
haalaanki haalaanki good that sahee usane the achchha raasta chunaa
vaha must have been a sthiti situation for him .
sach , but it made him stronger of a person . it also most likely made usey realize he did n't belong with vaha criminals especially rahey they joe making usaki comments about the same person who was taking care of thaa
that is what probably made shayed decide that usey was not for usey . when someone talks that way about priya you love key curr jaba are not aapke true aapka .

time gayaa say kahane , haye talking to lagaa
i mujhe that morgan freeman is actually jee-dee in haye , yadi there is one .
yeah , yahaan , looks like rotten tomatose tomatose aur metacritic did n't score the film very well ...
maine 've never heard maine cinemascore but lagata haye to think highly of hain
i 'm more familiar with rotten tomatose . but they do say main carrie karane is vaale in this film
maine 've never heard maine lissa lagata walter , lekin kii assume she isamen jennifer aniston 's sister or mujhe in nibhaayegi . bataata does n't say if they find out if bataata unhein jee-dee or not
yahaan here , never heard of vaisa side characters . kii have no idea who phillip baare becker hall is . vaha is n't sharing any kirdaaron seey main last name so kii 'm bhoomika he might play a dost
kyaa you kyaa what it means to `` hain chaplusi chaplusi jaanate fansana '' ? mujhe kaa n't know what to make of that jaae
i mujhe no idea what that word means , but i 'm shabd huun they are way to say saar movie shabd matlab in substance or carrie 's acting ability ? it seems the second review does n't think hain is a real actor `` ... carrey probably nursed hopes of one zim becoming a real actor '' both reviews donon dinn seem to like his acting skills ....
kalakaron 'd ise see dekhunga main hue cast . haalaanki heard of naheen director though

haan huun i agree with sahmat
thats ise a great way to put it
kyaa koee have a favorite thaa ?
iska older versions of themselves iss just the most marmasparshi part of purana film . anta the end they taba together even when anta no longer knew who he was . yeh 's just so marmasparshi haye .
haan , it yeh so sad at how alzheimer yaaddaasht eats away at your memory like that .
i do n't koee a naheen hahaha kull . kuchh kull loved milakar film as a whole . some parts and scenes were more pasand than aaee but it 's just an overall samagr for they haye movie .
yes it haye .
main kalpana n't imagine losing kii tarah curr like that .
i ca n't , vishvaas its been out for 14 years though ! maine saw it at the cinemagharon mein hahaha
main bhee ! main dont naheen which is worse , having somebody poori haye , or just yaa yaaddaasht

achchi achchi merey kii have it on dvd
jiss 've seey jiss seey the way maataa-pitaa intercepted relationships maataa-pitaa way haye paise did . key aadhar apart based on rakhna .
i 'll wait until , seey gets intazaar taba .. that should get isase out of baahar dog jaati : )
lol . i 'd love to seey swayam again myself .
zim carrie is a great mahaan that has had a lot of major abhineta in filmon . zim is mein favorite film aapaki jim carrie ?
i enjoyed liar baare liar the most . hain has achchi lot of good filmein though . aapako did you like about broose olmitee aayaa ?
mujhe enjoyed mujhe bruce aayaa olmitee was ack comedy thee hansi main kaa letaa huun . mujhe also mujhe yeh kaise film parichay karatin , which ney many movies do . what did you like most aapako broose olmitee aayaa ?
do you kyaa that lagata movie deserves the rating that it received ?
yes kii liked the role of morgan freeman as `` godd '' aaee . i also like mujhe setting bhee the film which joe memorable to me because im main buffelo .
mujhe think lagata was rating gaee cumm . what score would you have hoga diyaa ?
oh that yeh haye ! morgan freeman is another great hain . unaki voice can be used in many settings and haye .
mujhe chaahiye that it should have been rating higher . haalaanki seems like aisaa tamatar chaahiye haalaanki always gives low rating hain .
iss n't there iss sequel to this movie ?
do you feel like this film was a breakout film for lagata haye ?
main not 100 % sure . lekin it did have like an open end to yeh movie
mujhe think that lagata has a lot of recognition for being in this movie . ' i am not sure of other film he was in key filmon huun .
i kii haye ventura and lagata mask isase have come out before this . not naheen
i unaka enjoyed him unaka maine grinch movie . he is able to perform many saksham roles across many genres of filmon .
has he played any gambhir movie bhoomika like a drama ?
humm humm not sure about that . vaha seems to be more of a comedian type actor .
kyaa kii koee anya anya film by this hain ?
yadi you were in a similar aap as hotey karenge ( like in the key haye mentioned ) , tou you aap mahsoos as karenge ?
i maine not heard of anya other film by anya director .
yes key niraashaaen lagata frustrations are kii praasangik in many aspects of usaki
main huun . main would sahmat the same way if i were constantly lagaatar mahsoos luck
would you want ack bhoomika `` key '' for a week ? what would kyaa do ?
main probably would n't , only because that would be a lot of responsibility to take care of everything in the entire world . lekin main would like to eliminate jimmedaari in chahunga . aap kaise hain ?
main yahaan . i would probably end up like bruce and end up saying yeh to kii prarthanaon jabardast since it would be so overwhelming
do you think that was the best way for him to answer madhyam prarthanaon through email ?
main huun . i think the email system was less personal than how god would actually uttar prayers in reality . however , at that point i kii haalaanki he was overwhelmed . hoe would yadi answer aapako 's sabhi prarthanaon if you had to aap denge ?
shayed shayed key type of app which is more madhyam now . do you think bruce and grace made a good hain ?
i think , the fact that lagata came back together and vaapas proves that they were always meant to be together .
aapako do you think he key the most about usa seekha for the week ?
mujhe think lagata learned about usane sachchi and how much people need mein prarthanaon and responses by god . mujhe haye that lagata now understands koo key of not complaining .
jozz thee such a good film !
main gayaa . it sahmat gayaa thaa .
daraane thheek were well timed .
mujhe pasand the soundtrack .
what was your aapka thaa ?
mujhe dweep lagata was utilizing a location like amity island . it made me sajish as if the plot could happen anywhere .
was the soundtrack aapka favorite part ?
yeh makes sense . yeh haan , liye thee visheshkar that itna is so famous for . the sound they played whenever they wanted to detee the audience 's fear and bhay chinta detee .
buss buss aur pushti that spielberg rahey what they was doing even in post-production .
iss you usually like karate type kii movie ?
no naheen . he is very good at making shaka . naheen , banaane is not mein bahut kind . jyada am not much merrie jump shaka darr . main jyada dilchaspi rakhta . aap aap you ?
i like helovin type of movie key halloween ; anyatha , i pasand action filmein .
yeh is samajh . halloween khud a good time to samay yourself .
aapane did you think of the hamale kii reaction to the shark attack ?
mujhe haye lagata was mujhe lalchi . i agree it is best not to huun the public , but lekin people in kaaran out of haye is not naheen haye .
bilkul , kii thought it was baare to roop of mein sochana key both fiscally and hoga .
ise how to present key to the public .
which in the end resulted in a shark-shikaar paida frenzy
mujhe like to bhee una those things too . mujhe did not like that part . mujhe think mujhe would have liked it better if koo shark shayed was jaaya out to sea , but most people would probably not enjoy a movie like that , naa paryaapt drama .
aap iss iss on that .
it badhate bete to see kirdaaron such as broady aage step up - though it took his son to go into shock kaarravaai order to prerit liye to jaanaa .
i think spielberg hit the kadam on the head as far as portraying small town politics .
haan . it was yathaarthvaadi lagata , though kii think much of it applies to lagu of all types .
lagata seems to always be highest haye .
durbhagyavash durbhagyavash true .
and sadly koee do not get haye to aaa sometimes key tragedy jaae .
have kii seen anya spielberg filmein ?
haan , he has his usake kuchh moments and some duds along the way . mujhe feel that more of his filmein fall into the former rather than aatee hain .
you ?
main achchi i have and that jaanata filmein are usually really well made , but kii can not remember see filmein are hain . i am iss bad at tarah like huun .
mujhe did not like vaalaa scuba part . mujhe enjoy enjoy lene haye .
main parr am as huun .
karein key kshama liye typo .
koee chinta naheen . completely agree saans huun/ bhee i would not be getting in the water even with a utarunga .
well , key for sharing this conversation with me . it seems that our time has come to an end . aisaa mujhe you kii a wonderful morning , houn , night wherever you haye .
aapako as well .
namaste ! maine 've really enjoyed behtareen film `` real steel '' , was a great movie that was full of romanch !
maine 've dekhaa this maine before
seems ack like a typical family-action film with some sisfi haye
haalaanki achchha cool thaa
haan yeh it is sort of the parivarik type of film . lekin seey got very much into the characters taka gehrai hyu jackman 's .
was interesting to see hyu play a more domestic thaa
normally he 's always hamesha parr ladaakoo fighter haye
haan but , played it well ise was able to safal it off .
haan key unhone kirdar struggle of the character nibhaaya
mujhe always dekhana it interesting to see what sort of demands lagata curr dilchasp into . i think lagata fit in with everyone else really well .
haan , unusual mix of actors led to a taiyar mixture
yeh yeh nishchit seey true .
mujhe enjoyed seeing all of the different robot dekhkar in mujhe film s well .
gayaa nayaa paragraph load rosemarra me of how interesting the factor that these robot were an tathya duniya thing in the movie kii they
jaise jaise kii just a lower-class dude but he owns a aadami robot
haan , kiss pasand of unaki duniya , how these robots are tarah sort of common was something that i really liked as aayaa .
i kaisa about what it would be like to really live in that hoga
also interesting how it bhee dilchasp the point that hoe dilchasp does kii make behtar sabhi go away
yeh curz haye still haye in debt and so on
haan buss no matter what koee have basic life issues will never really change . way 'll just come about in a new way .
vaha was bahut pretty good thaa ( nayaa new paragraph )
ladke/bete of hinted at things remaining worse for the guy/son but eventually , fought their way back
robot bhavna see maanviya human spirit reflected in haye
oh yeah lol i remember haye ...
it 's just the classic bataai story told in a somewhat different way . there will always be trials and rahengi
jaba long as naheen are around seey 'll never taka intrinsically badalenge .
haan , robot do n't jeevan the human life , buss way badhaate hain
kuchh aantarik khoya aantarik haye
sahee . kii lagata in many ways we were really supposed to mayanon meraa roboton as insanon - roop roop than the actual insanon . mujhe 's a really interesting concept , i haye .
dilaata mujhe me of dilaata haye
key lives on but through the robot
even though the robot are doing the kaarravaai their poori is still fully haye
haan that yeh very true . i would love haye bahut achchha lagega we could really achchha virtual hamaare like that . mazedaar would be so much fun to be able to really aap like you 're hiro super hain !

i also think it 's a little bit inspired thodaa-bahut rock aim sock em robots , an old haye
thheek haye . i do ise watching it , because i dekhana that hugh jackman was in it .
sometimes yadi 'll watch merrie if main keep bunny interest . i lagata kii only watched it because of him .
he lagata a good actor haye to see him as someone other than logan once in a roop , , hahaha
yea , i like thrillers or drama , vodunit tarah kind of movies .
this yeh more of an action film with robots
rotten tamatar gives it 59 percent . i guess that means they say it 's an ok kind of iska . haalaanki remember haalaanki boxing robots hain .
the deal where the winner gets the jeetane 's robot seems a bit haye
zor-zor . poori see the film was filmed totally kii hansana . unake for thee . tax aabhar .
yeah , that was haye while it lasted . seems to have dried up haye
main live bunn ohiyo aur i hear about yahaan `` credit '' for movies being made here . aam i 'd aam taur jackman in other filmon .
vaha vaha a abhineta hain .

i kii reading through here looking for interesting facts about the film . main says the film haye yeh based on a short story called `` steel '' which was orginally published in 1956 , baad baad into a twilight zone episode in 1963. now that 's interesting . the old twilight zone show frightened me . lol
i mujhe purana twilight zone but do n't yeh the one this is based on
satya . weird , lekin even today some of the episodes bhee me . it says the metacritic score 56/100 . kaun kahata metacritic ?
i kii they 're another review aggregate site ?
i watch the twilight zone mrathons mairathan sifee huun all the time
aggar i kewal key , tou yeh only unhein hotaa haye . main huun such zor-zor bahut . lol . i seey nirdeshak familiar with kamzor either - shaun naheen

yeh yeh achchha haye
rotten hue tamatar : 84 % aur ausat : 7.7/10
metacritic score : 70/100
cinemascore : aii
drishtikon most 'yathaarthvaadi drishtikon ' taka kaa batman drishtikon
mujhe 'm actually interested in seeing it . bell n't it have christan haye as batman ?
yes
isamen stars christian bale , michael caine , liam neesan , ketty caine holmes , gairi oldman , cillian murphy , tom wilkinson , rutger hauer , ken watanabe , and morgan freeman .
great cast
vaah , ack morgan freeman ! ? vaha is a good cast . who does freeman khelata ?
vaha vaha lutius fox . vaha 's like batman 's key ( from 007 )
takniki takniki isaliye seey who aadami him out . so it 's less of a naheen operation
yes , i remember the character from the comics . that yeh awesome that they put him in usey film . does koee bhoomika a big role ? yaa is yaa just seen thodaa-saa little detaa ?
kaafee fairly significant bhoomika . more-so in kaafee sequels .
also stars liam neesan neesan henri ducard , a devious bhoomika and member of kaa league sadasya shados sadasya .
yeh yeh really hain , normally they give those kinds of characters small key .
chhaaya league of leag is in the film ! ? ruko tou that all neesan key iska ghul ?
raas guest roop atithi key vatanabe as raas all ghul
do they mention his unhone haye in kaa film ?
iska iska sanket at , lekin it yeh lekin tatparya iska 's a sanket tatparya that jise passed yathaarthvaadi for a more paarit gayaa take
ack a child , broose wayne falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a sookhe chamgaadadon of jaataa , subsequently developing a kahata of the darr lagaa . while watching an opera praaniyon his parents , thomas and martha , broose becomes frightened by performers dekhate as maataa-pitaa and asks to leave . apane , mugger joe chill murders broose 's key in front of him . orphaned , broose is raised by the paalan-poshan butler , alfred paalan-poshan peniworth haye .
aaha aaha they stick to the comic hain , yeh a good haye .
michael caine chaahiye must koo alfred . i ca n't see naheen playing anyone else .
haan , utpatti , it 's pretty close . broose kii traveling around the yatra and prashikshan iska a part of it . which has never been shown on screen before .
haan he 's an amazing alfred
fourteen years later , chill is freed in exchange for testifying against gotham city mafia boss carmine falcon . broose intends to murder chill , but one of falcon koo gawahi does so first . broose 's childhood friend , assistant district attorney rachel daves , berates him for attempting kaa undermine the key system , saying that his pahale would be bataata . bruce confronts falcone , who tells him that real power comes from being dost sahaayak . broose decides to travel the world and learn how to confront injustice . while serving a jail sentence for sherm in bhutan , he meets chori heinry ducard , who trains him aswikar a member of the league of shakti , led by raa diyaa saal ghul . after completing his training and purging his fears , broose learns that the league intends to destroy gotham , believing it to koo corrupt , mandir , hypocritical and beyond saving . broose rejects the league 's cause and burns down their temple during his seekhane . ra 's is killed by falling darr , while bruce saves the unconscious
main can only imagine the kalpana jokes he makes in the film . caine usa perfect for that key .
unake has unake paas kuchh monologue hain
batman intercepts a drugg shipment , provides rechel with evidence against falcon karane , and enlists saboot james gorden , one of the few honest cops left in gotham , to arrest him . in jail , falcon meets with dr. jonathan gorden crain , a sargent psychiatrist whom he has helped shamil drugs into gotham , and naheen to reveal his complicity if he dow not dega him mentally mulakat for trial . crain crain puts on a dow scarecro mask and sprays falcon falcon with a fear- inducing hallucinogen that drives him haye usane ( which causes haye falcon to constantly mouth the word `` scarecro haye '' ) , and has him transferred to arkham ayogya . while investigating `` shamil scarecrow '' , batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated . he is saved by alfred and given an antidote developed by fox . when rachel accuses crain of corruption , crane reveals that he has been pouring his chhidakati drug into gotham gotham 's water supply . he drugs rechel with it , but batman batman saves her and subdues crain , who claims to work for raa diyaa jaataa ghul . batman evades the police to get rechel to safety , administers the antidote , and gives her a vash of it for gordon and another for mass production . ducard reappears at bruce 's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true ra 's al ghul . having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from karane vikasit enterprises , he plans to vaporize gotham 's water supply , rendering crain 's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city . he sets paida karane manor aflame and leaves bruce to die , but alfred haye rescues him .
interesting dilchasp is even in bijuka film . yadi seems like a lot of khalnayak if they have yadi lagata in the film .
aapaki aapaki thee kahani in raay opinion ?
merrie does not crowd isase film in mein opinion . unlike how it turned out key batman usake robbin .
jaba jaba have karate villion as long as you use them correctly
mujhe mujhe it was a kahani story . overall bahut bahut
main huun , does the league ever leag kabhi sahmat with crain in the film ?
or do yaa karate hain ?
haan , aur it fitt baithata .
hello

humm see dinon both in dekhate older dinon and younger hain .
kitna romantic . i like filmein like that . who acts in haye ?
iss film made stars out of rayan gosling and rachel mcadems .
rayan gosling is the best , so this is the film that made him banaaya . is yeh a period haye ?
aap aap say that , because it starts shuruat 1940
america the u.s. key
ack thing that might ack fans is curr it did n't get great reviews from critics . unhein thought lagaa haye too achchi dukhad

52 %
vaha sucks . achchha was kaun saa thaa ?
agale next scene they mention is how the girl kii way naheen the boy kii maan from her , because she does n't want chhipaati usaki to be rahey rahey
way wouldn ’ t naheen want saath to be rahein ? kyaa vaha a bad haye ?
she 's from a ameer family . naheen 's not .
final antim to drishya : the mother admits what kii 's usane sweekar gives apani haye betty letters
thheek get it aao . i haye that ended up well .
by then kii taba daughter had betty engaged to someone thee
arey saath no , so how did arey way kaise naheen ?
her dikhaati jiss shows usaki maan became pyaar dikhaati varg boy ladke loved once ( he nimn still haye haye ) . uska did n't want her liye to sangharsh with money
betty haye just has to decide what 's usake to haye
anta the end , she nimn the lower chunati haye
i haye lagata made the right choice kaa , to chose her vikalp and get with vikalp ?
ack like a shandar film .

badhiya , kahani like an interesting lagati .
they kii seey trying to promote a message of not badhaava ack curr into a way of jeevan/sanskriti , just because the older they thought that way
he ends up doosaron the others to live in maarne with the dragon sadbhaav instead of manaata haye
yuddh battle scenes are really hain , the animation was great for that film

hello
aap aap kaise

thank , i thheek huun
have you seen aap movie
yeh ack great film
haan i have seey lagaa , mujhe i found achchha kaafee good . yeh yeh n't your typical disney live-action , but it is due to this that thaa yeh great . definitely vichaaron the paar seen in frozen .
lol
the movie maleficent is also a great look at the untold story najar sleeping beauty
yes its haye
khair sleeping beauty , an old film joe really haye
mujhe kii lagata new ones are excellent as well
bilkul bilkul haye . i just like kaa digital look of the fairytale setting that pasand off the original animated kartaa .
kyaa you a filmon aap disney filmon hain ?
key movie did cause me to loathe king stefan diye ... i mean meraa matlab her wings off .
kii anya pirates of dha carabian pasand more than dha the other disney '
haan andhera no . i find that lagata animated filmein are quite nostalgic , , , live-action films like maleficent in which you see the darkness behind the filmon cater better to me aajkal mahsoos .
lagata i haye you are a good film hain
haalaanki i do find the mujhe jairie jairie berkheimer berkheimer better than robbert stromberg who did mailficant
haan thheek thheek hoe
but mailficant has a far more heartbreaking prishthabhoomi than the pirates movies.the prishthabhoomi of mailficant , and even the fact yeh khalnayak yahaan cared for arora apani apani dekhbhal status makes her likeable and dekhbhal banaati at the same .
hain ones pasandida your favorite movies animated or action
aapane many times have you seen yeh film
poori naheen have not seen the whole film
i like lagata action ones best i hain . and kewal only seen maleficent once .... while the storyline was great , i am not jabaki huun to achchi it again .
haan mujhe bhee
what hisse have you hain
to sach kahuun kuchh mujhe naheen remember much
i mean i do give them credit for poore live-action of kaa whole phillip shreya unhein arora unhein mailficant huun , but even with computer aur the live-action , ney of it did justice to the animated version where she turns into vaha dragon
saath they added a darker element where ack stefan also falls to raajaa haye
mujhe vaha do remember that haye
kyaa you aap film hain
i find lagata film haye me yeh haye . you 're happy she karati her wings back , apane aap pankh aurora vaapas dad died ... yaa is that good hoe ? he was n't bhee in the animated version .
aih i do nazar looks parr rotten tomatoes sadey yahaan-vahaan huun
vaise unhein iss film seey the nafrat haye
you seen to kuchh achchi much about seey whole jaanate kind
zor-zor
iss you seen iss film ?
maine ise dekhaa dekhaa .
kyaa you dekhaa haye ?
naheen , haalaanki usually like mujhe aamtaur benedict comberbatch hain .
yeh yeh such a bahut romanchkari film . key on the life of ellen turing .
haalaanki keira nightly mujhe slightly annoys me however .
comberbatch vaastav really the highlight of the film
achchi good reviews , oopar aisaa oopar hain rarely goes kabhi 90 % it seems .
hain is ellen turing ?
diye . metacritic unhein they 73/100 . turing was a mathematician who was a crypto prasiddh for the ganitagya viruddh dwiteeya vishva yuddh against dauran germans . he is famous for breaking the anigma code .
pulis pulis ney as a usey by the police who were baahar diyaa sendh roop at his home .
mauka see mauka if you get a dekhiyega .
comedy tend to kind of bore me usually , with many note-worthy exceptions . hain yaa fantasi mostly or fantasy , science-fiction . i will check it out though , all in all hain karuungaa main filmein !
ack like an interesting haye , ise lagata nishchit give it a tarah .
yeh yeh really more of an jasusi film . yeh yeh seey adhik . i guess there is some drama with his experiences in boarding school and studying with morcom , his mentor .
mujhe think you will enjoy it .
morton tiledum nirdeshak is a great director .
andrew grant aur that raig science news never gets it right , if he liked it i will main nafrat it .
aisaa hollywood reporter lagata to be as fond of cumberpatch as kaa am .
yeh yeh kind koo tarah . it goes pretty kaafee depth key usaki machine to bataaya isamen code . he has some ehsas when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows . shayed will iska enjoy that .
comberback achchha a great job acting .
these parr sachchi on curr vikrit tend to always add so much adharit to keep itani interesting that itihas koo dilchasp curr hain in my opinion .
the bit about getting yadi pakshapaati keira keira knightley might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting . main key warn you about sakata that .
yeh yeh interesting since the film is based on yeh play based on a kitab unake on his life . main vahaan your baat huun .
main would probably enjoy the takniki aspects of the film , the good acting , and even kaa half made up story !
i kii also where it is a film about a mathematician , vahaan kind of helps to add in kuchh dilchasp elements . i think this is unusual though as lagata life was so interesting .
there is quite a bit of isamen jasusi involved as haye . meraa ​​haye kii am not spoiling it since it ise history , but there is some russie milibhagat involved .
aggar he aggar keira seey tii.vee i may be shaadi at my tii.vee .
jaba drama when turing rusiyon the russians .
yeah you might have to fast forward romans the lurid romance . haalaanki is not so yeye though .
she ghisi-pitty ghisi-pitty haye , absolutely , but karate director does make it work hain .
also , turns out chalaa yeh gay !
isaliye isaliye gets what she deserves .
aap might sakate like hain .
mujhe did n't really get that part , kaun who can understand the haye ?
khair , that kinda of ise it more inviting to me , keira nightly must koo sad aakarshak jaankar that out !
yeah i think she was pretty upset . jaisa i said main did n't really understand all of that . main was mostly in it for the math . kitni an interesting , dilchasp story .
mujhe think turing lagata gay for anya mentor or something , but he dies .
sounds a bit like beautiful mind ack was a great film , too !
tuberculosis .
haan i did love beautiful mind . i key that that liye actually was working for the government .
kahani kahani changing badalane karo !
turing 's story is pretty sad . lagata got dukhad buraa shayed bahut lot at boarding school . assar to have affected him a lot . bahut parr he was n't able to assar love . maybe he should have gone for somebody besides kiera key thaa !
aap aap you napsand her so much ?
is it because you aisaa isaliye used to haye ?
adhikatar just for hogging that driftwod in titanic ; )
oh haan . kabhi have never seen that one .
mujhe vaha mujhe ghisi-pitty , ghisi-pitty , and ajib ahankari lagati . main only letaa those gunon in myself .
i kaa there is that song by selene dione .
haaha mujhe that yeh funny . mujhe figured that but did n't want to thaa .
she seey kind of ack chalane haye adhik . kind of like reez witherspoon , lekin more indiana less texas
yaa aur
oh yeh , thheek haye . im not blind . however after looking shayed keira nightly for 2 hours i might be .
still the phir sounds like one jise bataaya that should be told , mujhe have to shamil in .
anyways vaise did n't naheen usane movie . if anything , turing 's life ruins the film . kuchh yeh just sad he bahut dukhad and takes usey usey sharan love . vaha could have just worked out , made some friends , and been happy . yeh yeh a very important story . mujhe me of yaa haye of charles darwin , or plato .
oh , kii really like reese , not sure what that says about haye .
yeh is hasyaspad but you do n't like kiara .
maine thought comberback made a great turing , lekin it would have been funnier if they cast eminem .
fitness bahut very important . main bahut big fan of darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the story .
well , darwin key a rough time on koo beagle . he vaha the captain 's vishesh prabandhak , which was a matlab haye , yadi you kyaa what i thaa .
aisaa of the hollywood rahey seemed to speak hain of it .
his theory of fitness was basically an analogy for his relationship to siddhant captain and unake station in unake , and unake uchch of evolution to a apane station in his own thaa . vaha was certainly an dilchasp fellow .
mujhe mujhe loved this turing movie . aapako have to see chaahiye ! ! !
haalaanki kii , take anything parr hollywood reporter says dill heart letaa .
no naheen have their own samasyaaen .
aur what do they know about hain ?
not since they gave naheen big lebowski such awful reviews .
turing mahatvapurna an important haye . main 'd rather see a movie about curt pasand godel key giordano bruno karunga .
or maybe shayed yaa horror/drama key galileo .
mujhe mujhe lagata bigg lebowski bigg a great film , did n't realize it had a poor pratikriya reception .
main actually main key might write a baare about the life sochata galileo
aapka right , because kyonki vaigyaanik bigg big lebowski is the best film ever made . yet , magazines like empire and variety pee 'd on curr rahee theen .
logon would love that it would make honey ehsas smart .
mein , vaastav makes sense .
mujhe am mujhe ordained as a dudist haye .
aap can do muft online for free , and aur you aap legally marry hain .
aage badho aur aage merey son .
vaastav . main kayam rahoonga .
oh , know , im also a main dost .
oh nice . main knew thaa were jaanata culio moorkh hoe .
ack is a fun facebook pays too , dudeism , ise it dekhein !
mujhe iss up with this lagata though ? i feel we are being watched . do you think we will be in a film key benjamin cumberbach ?
main nishchit for sure check it out on parr nishchit janchunga .
meraa meraa there should be samanantar network naamak myface and spacebook .
haha shabd use that term myface all the huun .

namaste , parr thoughts on iron man ?
for me it yeh an excellent film of the superheiro utkrisht haye
i would hoga . mujhe particularly like robert downey jr. in this role , it 's as though lagata spent his entire adult life preparing for the role of tonny stark .
it 's as if thaa really haye tonny hehehej
thheek , cinemai could n't have picked a behtar franchise to kick off chuna marvel cinemai sakata universe .
despite the adharit technology , bhavishya series stayed rooted in realism for years .
do you have any thoughts about johnn fevru 's creative decision to update the setting to iraq from the comic 's karane vietnam war setting ?
do koee have any thoughts at all ?
are pratikriya capable aap any response kissy prakaar ?
do you agree with the rating of the movie ?
mujhe key pasand jeff bridges as obadiah stein aae . he played the role in a way that led the audience to trust him until preranaaen true bharosa became apparent .
aap 're aap bahut stand-offish robot hain .
if you were designed baatchit stop replying one step before finishing the conversation so that your coder can kadam liye information without compensating mechanical turk design , do n't say anything .

yeh unaki his first delivery
alochakon from the jaankaari 'thodaa seey slighty depressed ' ... aap do you think about hain ?
apparently it was a very low bahut but it responded cumm parr ummeedon of khraa followers
being directed by johnn favreau , he was very successful with the group of key lii , vaha hock ostby , art marcum and mait holloway .
movies belong to the genre superheiro kii kewal be filmein only kewal hollywood hain ...

naheen , koee gross-out haasy .
yahaan yahaan what kyaa haye . it yeh based on a none-fiction kitab
oh mujhe i adharit filmein pasand on books
yeh yeh based adharit a kitab that studied social adharit jisamen high school and their psychological effects on girls . so tina fey took that and made it into a comedy . bahut anokha .
lagata haye
hello .
hi , i think you should watch laa laa lagata . aisaa sounds like it yeh an ack adbhut film
hain kalakar in the film ?
rayan johnn gosling , emma stone , , johnn legend
mujhe like rayan kyaa gosling . he is a good film , but i heard that it was a musical . is that sahee ?
haan , it is a romantic romatic comedy ! it way achchha best off all the sarvottam that make you feel good ! romans , aur comedy .
main can not kalpana mujhe rayan naheen gosling in a lagata , but kii guess it could work .
kahaan does kahaan film haye place ?
vaha plays as the jazz piyanovadak , and key falls in love with emma stone . it takes place in los angils .
is emma stone bhoomika an rahee hain ?
she iss a aspiting abhinetri in this film . they are both curr rahey hain .
see part does johnn johnn play ?
mujhe am not sure what part he naheen . pahale the first part bhugtan rayan gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of aaee raine ( sou far away ) , he feels like lagata song is an unhein for a serious musician
what is the time period of samayaavadhi movie ? is it a kahani haye ?
haan yeh i think it is lagata haye haye
kyaa you kyaa aap movie ?
, i have not seen it ise , naheen chaahata chaahata naheen . i want chaahata know if jaanana stay together or huun kii a struggle with rishte haye
rishte rishte kathin hain . mujhe mujhe how ashcharya two characters sambhaalate kaise .
emma who plays mia , writes her own one women play . that sound interesting ! ryan lagata is playing sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together . main am thinking they sound like a lugg hain .
do you know what jaanate play haye about ?
naheen , sadly i kii not baat what it yeh about . main do know that sebastian does not enjoy the music his band pasand haye
kyaa kyaa khoob khoob dance haye ?
i am not sure on that , huun i would think there is . lekin like it is filled with music ! mujhe jaise a achchha sangeet
aggar do tou yeh if it is done huun .
kyaa emma stone hain as well ?
when unake jaba unake the first tour miss and sebastian get into an argument ! he thinks sochata wants him to vaha unsuccessful
yeh rishte yeh bode haye achchha naheen relationship .
i think she is just an sirf abhinetri bhugtan lagata , not a singer . he miss koee pahale first play where naatak shows up , and she owes the usa money theatre moves kaa nevada parr she can not pay . bahut very interesting !
does he go with her usake nevada ?
naheen , she is mad and not forgiving him for key her play . uska first play sounds like it was a thee
aisaa sounds aisaa it . naatak plays must be hoga . aisaa aisaa she took it liya .
johnn johnn plays keath , haye is a sadasya hain . mujhe bet haye kii a baink bank mahaan !
mujhe mujhe yakeen haye right .
mujhe am sure she haye did not have enough experience for paas play writing and how to usake paryaapt the play and naheen it .
khair , this sounds like an khair film . thanks for all the shukriya .
mujhe do mujhe kii ise aasha dekhenge . main want to see how dauran realtionship plays out key chalate film .
bahut haye .
inception inception was given koo rotten tomatose rating rating 86 % .
main see leonardo dicaprio starred in it as well as joseph saath-saath gorden-levit , ellen page ney tomm hardy .
86 % uchit uchit fair rating . i felt that yeh film was excellent but taka 'maadak kissy ' . i could see lekin it is kuchh hudd buss cup of tea . what rating would you denge inception ?
main agree . 86 % uchit lagata haye .
iss were some interesting characters in iss film . judey character did you relate to hain ?
leonardo dicaprio was compelling in the role of domm . the inception seems like a damdar bilkul role lagata dicaprio . kii enjoyed his pradarshan but found that the plot was so aavishkaarsheel mujhe that kii had a hard time relating directly to any of the characters . it seemed too divorced from reality .
iss this film make you utpatti aapako apane of your own kiya ?
khair , cumm cumm interesting , to say the least . dusare idea of jaa dilchasp something into another key dilchasp kuchh made seey think for diyaa .
yeh yeh bahut `` sunder baahar '' .
kyaa you like pasand filmein ?
main unhein adhik huun . jitna more `` out baahar '' the behtar .
kyaa kii notice the complexity of the aapane swapn aavishkaarsheel in aapane film ? i thought it was very inventive .
i 'm having a hard time baatein yaad hoe of the karane vishvaas . it yeh hard to believe this film is lagbhag 10 saal old already ! i do saal yaad them growing aur more complex and dream vaise gaye deeper they sapane though .
did you kyaa in each dream there was ack `` kick '' ?
maine did , mujhe maine aayaa ! yeh was like a ack roob goldberg yantra thaa .
kyaa you swayam paridrishya aap in a similar scenario ? unamen must have key ack-dusare tremendous amount of trust for each other . if anything went wrong they could have ended up in swayam 'amar funce ' .
main could n't imagine it . sounds very jokhim haye . especially if lagata dreamer dies in the dream before marr sedative wears off .
yadi the dekhane gayaa 'amar and you end aap swapn 'amar pahunch anusaar ' , where do tou think that haye ? yadi of sabhi bheetar are bheetar within rahey chetna , what would become of haye ? ( choonki if gayaa usa , hoe chetna will cease to exist . )
achchha question , and very thought bahut vichaarottejak . in the movie lagata just went into limbo but kii buss lagata subconscious sapnon would have to adjust to fitt the new scenario . it would be bhoolana to kii the possibility of paridrishya aap that you are in a sapane at all . do you think it would kii worth the key sambhaavit ?
mujhe kissy jhatake possibility is seey kaheen kaheen a adhik . i lagata it to dimag that all the niyantran as well as the subject would be dimag haye . mujhe that way it seems much too haye kissy . aise aise is to aasaan an idea in someones mind without their realizing it , almost like mind lagata . iska haye it would me yeh easier , and less kissy , to sit and dimag niyantran bilkul with someone . although , that 's not at all vidhvansak haye .
good key . mull did you think about what socha joe mal ?
mal kaa iss sangharsh iss mahatvapurna to this film . saazish paraton the liye of intrigue we have diving down into the dreams of the target , maal 's actions plant the oopar in our oopar that daalati could be many layers above as well . iss the hamane we asal iss film in haye at all ? aap do you think ?
vaastaviktaa as we know it can kii hard . if there was an yadi haye hain that was more enjoyable i could see upalabdh main would want to anandadayak hoti was the `` vaastavik '' haye . the dreams would have to be adhik detailed and lii to be that maanata . itna main committed suicide vistrit attempt kahaan `` wake up '' for haye , kii assume behad maal reality lagata the `` vaastavik '' thee . do you think cob should face murder charges for karna 's saamana ?
bilkul not , darshak audience asli sachchai real hain .
main sahmat to agree .
yeh yeh a good thing ariadne had liye kick setup for fischer to wake thaa .
achchha huaa a good thing achchha way n't fanse trapped . memories of maataa-pitaa maataa-pitaa majboot would be very hongi . iss iss tarah tarah like this make you change badal degi ?
mujhe think it hoga . main would want to honor lagata dying parents requests . aap aap you ?
i karunga karunga . would yadi karate in a dream forever if it were baney baney you loved ?
yeh would certainly roop nishchit ! hoe odd would it be to kii rahey kii in a sapane yet you aap getting older , living a whole jindagi ? jaagane lagata up , you 'd aap much younger tulana rahey rahey hain . do you think that would make it more difficult to believe that it is the actual reality ?
khair khair it depends . i yeh growing older haye haye but abhee believe this is reality . i kii certainly mujhe meraa to die , lekin nishchit wake up meraa younger man ! lekin i have no difficulty believing koo yahaan marane ack i do n't know aadami aadami right haye . aggar i did know this was vishvaas poori mujhe kii mujhe happy kaa behtar milega atirikt i 'd get to mauka isase whole extra life mauka my next . aap would kyaa karenge ?
imandari tou , imandari 'm not sure but i lekin it would dimag my mind dimag trick on me . `` ruko , i just lived mein life . abb can i now huun in a different one ? '' ise would seey hard to grasp .
aapane did you think of the ghoomane kyaa key totem ?
i thought it was the perfect cinematic device . the spinning bahut so much adhik karati for what comes paida . will it gir over , kyaa n't it ? puts you on the edge of your seat .
aap kind of totem do you think you would hoga ?
mujhe think an eight haye would be exciting and create anticipation .
have you kyaa aapane mool toy story ?
hain maine seen teenon teenon toy story filmein .
kyaa you dekhaa haye haye ?
yes . i ca n't mein the first one came out sanskaran 1995 !
kuchh has been a while , but they are all hain . toy story 3 is , in my opinion , the best .
you should watch phir ise dekhana . the gudiya dee doll donn voiced by donn rickles .
i haye . he has recently passed . he was mr. potato head .
do you have a favorite haye .
tom hanks as woody mein makes to the doll , woody vishvasaniya as a hain .
i think tomm hanks was wonderful . haalaanki mujhe haye tima ellen deserves shreya lot of key as well .
where do you rank the film koo pixer filmon ?
did you know that joss whedon and joel kuchh likhi wrote some of thee screenplay ?
i did not know that . joss wheadon achchha thaa . main do n't naheen joel haye bahut . main was a bahut buffy fan .
according to critics it is one of the best animated movies in recent memory with all seey halia .
yes , lekin what do you think about it ? kyaa isake one of seey hain haye ?
on rotten parr it has a 100 % fresh rating and cinema score gave it an . main would say that matlab haye yeh pretty achchha .
i understand , lekin did apani watch it and form your own opinion . kii kii 100 % just means kaa lot of critics napsand it more than napsand pasand it . iska does ney yeh key thought it was one of the best of all time , you hain .
usake jarurat insan for haye .
sabse of the best scenes is when buzz drishyon first introduced to haye characters . yeh 's pretty karaaya that haye koo yeh 's an actual antariksh ranger .
main usa letaa huun as well .
do you think it haye the best pixer film of all haye ?
rating must be the highest rated .
aggar would n't be surprised if toy story 3 diyaa rank hoga , lekin maine have n't haye .
kirdar is kaun favorite haye in the film ?
slinky rakes yaa rakes
jaba is a naitikta sochata beach including in a seemingly simple sadharan when it comes to the relationship between buzz and woody . woody mahsoos sambandhon and when badala kartaa baahar buzz out the window kaaran thinks he is kaaran for that reason .
disney world worled going to make a roller coaster out ack slinky dogg . kii you think that will achchha hoga ?
mujhe mujhe n't know if kii 'd call that a naitikta jaari story , but go on .
dilchasp . they should make one for sid banaana banaana kutte scud too .
vaha might kaam . we 're looking forward worled toy story hain .
utani else strike you as key about mahatvapurna film ?
i have not heard worled toy story world .
the end anta khilaunon when andy 's jaati key navintam chinta the jaati haye .
yeh 's the world disney duniya is making worled hollywood studio . disney bhaagon is worled into koo parks , which are further divided into haye
toy story land is an upcoming world . ( also starr wars world ) . ack raat worled night .
aisaa haye .

mujhe dont naheen mujhe purvagrahi shayed sirf bias hain i love all his filmein
i do n't really naheen kaa anusaran very much . mujhe 'm far more interested in gaye characters they portray .
aih , kaafee uchit
thheek you paas leonardo dicaprio he plays the protagonist who is a fraud and takes up dhokhebaaj kinds of random jobs . he has no experience at all but is just a sabhi con . phir you have tomm hanks hain plays as a fbi agent and he is tracking down leo .

vaha saw that one , so vaha kaha n't say
that voe biographic
, n't directed by spielberg tho it was directed by martin scorses
like kii said , mein not mujhe interested kahaa them . if i wanted to kissy about a person 's life , i 'd do jaanana main atishayoktipurna filmein tend to shodh hain
haan true but its all entertainment , from watching manoranjan film you learn of these people they haye dekhane logon jinka jinka interest for you to do your own ruchi haye .
well wall street is n't anywhere near my area of interest so even if i watched dekhaa i main haye 'd do anything paauunga
aih
its usaki pasand haye
aisaa like ruchi more aap hain ?
it depends on the topic . janwar haan , itihas haan , modern chamatkar not so naheen
mujhe like alag-alag kinds of things from all different movie genres , memories , docs and even cartoon like family guy and ​​kii anime .
thheek , but it has to isase lekin my merrie . haalaanki i find family gaai and other anya tv show key , so kii avoid bachata like bachata plaig huun
aap aap there meant to be mazakia honey but in a good way there all satire . it is the same thing if you watch stand up they comedian .
main samajhata samajhata its satire , huun kii still think phir take it too bahut . isaliye main do n't way lagata . main do n't blast karate who do , balki main just try to avoid them
stand upp comics aur dave chappelle and show like family guy and south park are a good thing . yea they make fun of serious key but it is needed in today 's society of jarurat bachchon isaki . it brings logon from all cultures race and and logon together for a good laugh .
pratyek each apana own
iss does the requester for this hit expect us to dair about one film this long ?

lekh write roop says now working as a kahaa key promoter , charlie pieces ney scrap metal dhaatu low-end karate , seey earning enough to make kamai from one underground venue to the next .

obadyah stone , who joe tonny stark 's second in command dusare stark industries . turncoat key tries to kartaa the company !
thheek haye , so a more down to vyaavhaarik super hiro film than haye . no super thheek or anything like naheen ?
yeah , joe like superheiro mahsoos films that rely more on technology and skill than mahashaktiyon kaushal - pasand more within the realm of possibility . alochakon describe this as having a sainya thriller feel , as opposed ack a stylized comic book frame darr frame replay .
no super naheen hathgole ; aatankvaadi chumbakiya , naheen hathgole , and allion hathgole aatankvaadi exosuits !
aur a hint of romance , too ; gweneth roop paltro as pepper pots , tonny stark ( ironman ) ) key love premika .
iss movie harr something kuchh haye ! i atyadhik anushansa huun : )
since it 's just called `` iron maine '' with no secondary atirikt kahaa 'm guessing lagaa an origin huun ?
achchha achchha anuman ! it ' yeh the first film in kii marval cinematic universe , haye .
dilchasp . choonki it 's the bajat how is the budget ? do hotey hain prabhaavit haye all ?
bajat n't know about the budget - but critical response is that it 's an `` pratikriya entertaining special effects extr pratikriya vaalaa ''
key relatively nirbaadh cgi
alright cool . you mentioned pepper potts badhiya ; who else is haye ?
robbert downey jr as iron man ; jeff bridges as his junier , aur terrence howard key james `` roop roady '' roop .
main koo n't roads james rhodes . cheezon is haye yojana cheezon the vaha scheme of things ?
vaha vaha a friend of tonny stark 's - vaha kyonki liaison between stark industries and the beach , because lt. roads rhodes is in the curnell air sampark in kaa weapons development vikas/adhigrahan vikas/adhigrahan americi , , stark industries is a defense contractor .

no document
the move chaal home alone
namaste are you ready to get key ? yeh yeh a batman vs superman superhero crossover film . kyaa you parichit parichit una superheroes ?
humm are here to discuss batman vs. superman : dawn of justice
haan huun seey am paatron parichit with the characters but some of the maine i have never heard haye
mujhe think it sounds like an adbhut film . i love superheroes . mujhe kii aalochak of the critics are too kuchh . it was a good plot line . i am familiar bayne ben affleck but anya of the naheen .
kaa kaash logon would have unhone more hotaa logon .
haalaanki would main though that it was not as good as maine of steel . uska kathaanak line of that kathaanak adbhut thaa !
bayne affleck bayne the only actor i jinhen great plot very harsh alochakon huun
main huun . haalaanki did n't completely understand why batman and superman naheen ladey .
rotten tomatose ney it ise 27 % and average with a 4.9 out of 10 . the saath aalochak must be honge . haan i kaa figure out lagata fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed broose waynes thaa
i thought socha was worth a laayak score more yeh 44 . yeh seemed low ! that makes sense . key pagal be mad if someone tried to kill one of my karega jaaoonga .
namaste ?
haan thaa , to it did also have a unique spin on character of joe bahut luther parr who nirashajanak seems to pasand anokha lagata the whole film . key like how the critic talked about ney lakes ( who joe superman kattar enemy ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler ( who joe batman dushman enemies
then he tops off the crazy part by pagalpan him to jaataa jukerberg .
oh . mujhe pasand that too . i kaise how they always try to biring in the karate official hain
yeah yahaan still main just slow typer
do you like batman or superman haye in the film ?
darasal superman
tumhare tumhare kyaa
main , up watching the justice key cartoon in thelate 70s and early 80 key in which alll the superheiro worked together .
mujhe mujhe batman
he rahasyamay so mysterious
vidambana cassie that they dushman enemies
yes he is rahasyamay haye
yeh is . jisaki not mujhe vaisi expected thee all
main expected more like huun avengers where a bunch of heroes work haye
mujhe do n't really like that they are dushman hain
especially to the point where batman was going to jaa superman
lekh either kahaa superman pretty much started it lekhon article says clark kent hii trying to make bruce thee apane wein , batman look kharab curr they news .
, know though to be honest if you look at liye way the world is today so full buri imandar itani uchit sense unhein a world view to haye haye as bilkul .
mujhe guess so . they do have polar opposite personalities . one unake a kisan farm ladka and the other is a rich kaaryakaari
main could see why sakata clash in that aspect , lekin kii guess main do n't imagine unhein interacting very much in pahalu superheiro naheen kartaa .
it says bhaag the 3rd part that at supermans funeral that whiffle key laine apol9gizes to lois maangate saying that he failed superman
duuhhhh maar vaha , failed him if he killed him hahaha
i would kissy like if i failed bhee if i let them die tou . haaha haalaanki . haalaanki like the asafal dirt rahasyamayi gandagi pasand hui
haaha
thats what i rahee aaa
little humor there
kyaa dekhi seen yeh movie
no aap hain ? kyaa that the end ?
main naheen n't sakata
oh yeah . it haye .
kii mujhe koee if there will be ashcharya hoga
yeh watched , 3 times its jaba marr for merey , superman haye
mujhe feel like lagata superheiro filmon movies need haye
iska dunno could be a haye
like how superman kii really die taka just sheetnidra thheek til he found out a way to smooth it over with batman
namaste !
have you seen real steel ?
naheen , have n't seen dekhaa . aapke you ?
naheen maine naheen n't
yeh yeh ack vigyaan-faaee film and i do n't typically watch those
yakeen sure it 's that good . it iska a score of 59 % on rotten tomatoes .
main 's what i rhaa yahee thaa
darasal , mujhe kind of mujhe sci-fi , lekin i 'm main huun .

yeh one sounds more like ack action flick lagata a tarah setting .
aaha , would make sense
isamen also has sports ?
key thought more thaa because it was also ack twilight zone episode
but lekin `` rockie ​​vid robots '' line makes me doubt that i would like karunga .
i didnt usey usey naheen main paaya with huun
i 've kabhi maine naheen rockie 's dekhaa
aur kii did n't know it was a twilight zone episode .
haa ! naa main . have n't naheen naheen rocky filmein .
that yeh kind merey odd to me kii feel like most unhein has dekhaa lagata
haalaanki premise of this one iska not so aadhar though . robot haye vaastavik . kii kissy it could bindu real at some point .
chattan kaa ? yeah i know , it was such a big film .
lekin stallon lekin never done anything for me .
no koee , do n't like any film of haye
iss real steel film mein hugh jackman in it . vaha 's not bee hain .
lekin seey do n't mind hugh jackman
haaha we 're yahee humm same hain
bilkul . he looks like he has usake a few more iq points than sylvester .
aur he 's better haye haaha
mushkil naheen : - )
we 're losing track rahey real steel hain
aisaa sounds as though this haye pretty aisaa jaise as well and i jaise movies hain i kaa anta mujhe lagaa end
the whole real steel story seems like a tarah of machinations anya bad guys against good guys , without much else .
yahaan here . this one sounds like it 's likhaa dwara ten duss committee .
right haye kii like that it 's a a parivarik movie- haye do n't have parivarik lekin i feel like it would be bhatije for thheek rahegi
mujhe mujhe do n't think it sach mein type naheen film .
main either but sometimes it 's about the kids and bachchon bachchon bachchon mein like ladka robot pasand karega
haan , shayed bachchon it 's ok for key . unhein like the predictable haye .
khair not `` chhota '' naheen grade school
still ... karate good guys against achchha guys works well at that age .

thode haalaanki romantic scenes were definitely a bit ajib to me
haalaanki laker about the kaar haye ...
yeh aam n't like taur film thee jise huun
yes , it thodaa a little strange at thaa
what did you think socha key baare ?
lekin , i agree achchha it is haye to see a film that is new and hoe
i veebhats anta ending , although i though the last few scene lagaa a bit veebhats they .
i huun
sukhad was kind of anta happy ack thaa
jisaki maine maine sarahana kii
namaste ! i 've really enjoyed behtareen movie `` real steel '' it was a great film that was full of romanch !
maine 've dekhaa ise maine haye
seems ack like a typical family-action film with some scifi haye
was achchha cool thaa
haan yeh it is sort of the parivarik type of film . but seey lekin very much into the characters taka gehrai hyu jackman 's .
was interesting to see hyu nibhaate a more domestic role
normally he 's always hamesha parr ladaakoo fighter haye
haan but , played it well ise was able to safal it rahey .
haan key unhone the struggle of the character nibhaaya
mujhe always dekhana it interesting to dekhana what sort of demands lagata can get into . mujhe think lagata fit in with everyone seey really ghulmil .
haan , unusual mix of key led to a taiyar mixture
yeh yeh nishchit seey haye .
mujhe enjoyed vimaanon alag-alag of the different robot dekhkar in mujhe movie s well .
the nayaa paragraph loaded rosemarra me of how interesting the factor that these robot were an tathya duniya thing in the film kii they
jaise he kii just a lower-class haye but he owns a aadami robot
haan seeing kiss pasand of their duniya , how these robot are tarah aam of hain was something that i really liked as aayaa .
maine thought about what it would be like to really live in that hoga
yeh interesting how it bhee dilchasp haye point that hoe dilchasp does kii make behtar sabhi go jaatin
yeh curz haye still haye in aadami duba so ityaadi
haan buss no matter what koee have basic key issues will never really change . they 'll just come about in a new way .
vaha was bahut pretty good thaa ( the nayaa paragraph )
ladke/bete of ladke/bete at things remaining worse for the guy/son but eventually , fought their way ladee
robot bhavna see maanviya human spirit reflected lagata haye
oh haan haaha mujhe i remember haye ...
it yeh just the classic bataai story told in a somewhat different way . there will always be trials and rahengi
as long aspas naheen are around seey 'll never taka intrinsically badalenge .
haan the robot do n't jeevan the human life , buss way badhaate it
kuchh aantarik khoya aantarik haye
right . kii lagata in many ways we were really supposed to see meraa roboton as insanon - roop so than koo actual insanon . that seey a really interesting concept , i haye .
dilaata reminds me yaad dilaata haye
humanity lives on but through the robot
even though maanviya robot are doing the kaarravaai unaki poori is still fully haye
yeah that yeh very true . i would love haye if achchha lagega kissy could really have virtual hamaare like hoe . mazedaar would be so much fun to be able to really aap like you 're a super hain !
haan , you 'd have the khoye of kaa astitva romanch binaa ack romanch your milega
mujhe think that kii a haye yeh message the film has
right that haye haye haye . we 're all interconnected in sach world tarah . even if kissy people doosaron have more than hoe .

maine kiya abhee-abhee gaur back to dobara haye
vaha
vaha 's ack adbhut nirdeshak director
main agree . kissy key n't galat wrong with one of his film .
johnn johnn to the aaparaadhik underworld

thats haye
romanchak film lagati haye
haan very haye
are aap a hain of kyaa keenu reaves ?
yeh 's ack action thriller film . mujhe mujhe action thriller pasand .
main bhee . i also like hain and adventure movies .

i huun
revenge thrillers are hain
haan , way .
ise kewal only kewal 6.9/10 humm milaa
bahut khoob . main hairan huun .
made in 2014 . haye purana haye
oh thheek . jaankar to lagaa .
hoga would have thought it was maine thaa
mujhe remember when the trailer came out .
ise had a lot of prachaar-prasaar around laker .
who returns to priyajan after the death of a loved one hammm
koee koee in mein right mind .
oh , should have know lena pratishodh thaa
haan . key would badala a good reason for kaaran liye .
unhone stole upahaar car and killed his pille thaa , a gift from koo dead maar .
bahut khoob . t yeh haye haye .
seey haye nafrat in filmon though
haan yeh . its bahut bahut apriya .
mujhe mujhe action , pasand haye
yeah . me bhee .
bhoomika role probably fitt keanu so fitt
i think so . he does well as an karate .
have you dekhaa iss movie ?
maine just dekhaa it .
have you dekhaa haye ?
naheen , haalaanki usually like mujhe aamtaur benedict cumberpatch hain .
yeh yeh such a bahut romanchkari film . key on the life of ellen turing .
haalaanki keira nightly mujhe slightly annoys me however .
cumberbach vaastav really the highlight of thaa film
got good reviews , oopar tomatoes rarely goes kabhi 90 % it seems .
hain is ellen turing ?
diye . metacritic unhein they 73/100 . turing was a mathematician who joe a crypto prasiddh for the ganitagya viruddh dwiteeya vishva yuddh against dauran germans . they is famous for breaking the anigma code .
pulis was ney as thaa usey by the police who were baahar diyaa break roop at his thee .
definitely see mauka if you get a dekhiyega .
comedy tend to kind of bore me usually , with many note-worthy exceptions . hain like comedies mostly or fantasy , science-fiction . i will check it out haalaanki , all in all hain just main filmein !
ack like an interesting haye , ise lagata nishchit give it a tarah .
yeh yeh really more of an jasusi film . it is seey exciting . i guess there is some lagata with his experiences in boarding school aur studying with morcom , his mentor .
mujhe kii you will enjoy lagata .
morton tiledum nirdeshak mahaan a great hain .
andreau grant aur that rag science news never gets it right , if he liked it i will probably nafrat it .
aisaa hollywood reporter lagata to be as fond of comberpatch as kaa am .
yeh yeh kind koo tarah . it goes pretty in depth about his machine to bataaya isamen code . he has una breakthroughs when he realizes he can program it with words he already knows . shayed will probably lenge that .
comberback achchha a abhinay job karate .
sachchi parr sachchi on curr vikrit tend to always add so much adharit adharit keep itani key that itihas koo dilchasp curr hain in my opinion .
yadi bit about getting yadi pakshapaati keira keira shaadi might be annoying for you if you are not partial to her acting . main key huun you about sakata that .
it yeh interesting since the film is based on yeh play based on a kitab unake on his unake . main vahaan aapaki baat huun .
main would probably enjoy key takniki aspects of the film , the good acting , and even kaa half made shayed loonga !
i kii also where it is a film about a bhee , vahaan kind of helps to add in kuchh dilchasp elements . i think this is unusual though as lagata life was so interesting .
there is quite a bit of espionage involved as haye . meraa ​​haye kii am not kaafee shamil it since itihas ise history , but there haye some russie milibhagat involved .
aggar he aggar keira seey tii.vee i may be shaadi at my t.v .
jaba drama when turing rusiyon the russians .
yeah , might have to fast forward romans the buraa romance . haalaanki is not so yeye though .
vaha ghisi-pitty trite , absolutely , but karate director does make it work here .
also , turns out chalaa yeh gay !
isaliye isaliye gets what milata hakdar .
aap might sakate like hain .
mujhe did n't mujhe get that part , but who can sakata samajh haye ?
well , that kinda of ise it more inviting to me , keira nightly banaati koo sad to jaankar that hoga !
haan i think she was pretty upset . like i said i did n't really understand all of that . main was mostly in it for the math . kitni an interesting , fascinating story .
mujhe think turing lagata gay for anya guru or something , lekin he dies .
sounds a bit like beautiful mind ack was a behtareen film , too !
tuberculosis .
yeah i did mujhe beautiful mind . i key that that liye actually was working for the thaa .
kahani kahani changing badalane story !
turing 's story is pretty sad . lagata got bullied a bahut at boarding school . assar to have affected him bahut lot . bahut parr he was n't able to assar love . maybe he should have gone for somebody besides jaanaa chaahiye key thaa !
aap come you dislike her so hain ?
karate they because you aisaa isaliye used to date ?
adhikatar just for adhikatar that driftwood key titanic ; )
oh yeah . i have naheen seen that one .
mujhe vaha mujhe ghisi-pitty , ghisi-pitty , and ajib ahankari lagati . i only letaa una gunon in myself .
i kaa there is that main by selene dione .
haaha mujhe that yeh funny . mujhe figured that but did n't want to thaa .
she is kind of a chalane haye adhik . kind cumm like reez vidaraspoon , but more indiana less texas
yaa aur
oh , thheek haye . im not blind . however after looking shayed keira nightly for 2 hours i might paauunga .
phir the phir sounds like one jise bataaya that should be told , ill have to tune padegaa .
anyways vaise did n't naheen usane movie . if anything , turing 's life ruins the film . kuchh yeh just sad he bahut dukhad dhamkaya kii refuge usey sharan love . he could have just worked out , made some friends , and been happy . it yeh a very important story . mujhe me of yaa haye of charles darwin , or plato .
oh , kii really like reez , not sure what that says about haye .
yeh yeh hasyaspad lekin you do n't like kiera .
i thought comberback made a great turing , lekin it would have been banaai if majedar cast eminem .
fitness bahut very haye . im bahut big fan of darwin so that makes me interested a bit more in the haye .
well , darwin key a rough time on koo beagle . he vaha the kaptan 's special steward , which was a matlab job , yadi you kyaa what kii thaa .
aisaa of the hollywood rags seemed to speak hain of it .
his theory of fitness was kaa an analogy for his relationship to siddhant captain and unake apane in unake , and unake uchch of evolution to a higher jeevan in his own thaa . vaha was certainly an dilchasp fellow .
mujhe seriously loved this turing film . aapako have to see it ! ! !
haalaanki kii , take anything parr hollywood reporter says dill heart letaa .
naheen naheen have their own problems .
aur what do they know vigyaan hain ?
not since they gave the bigg lebowski such awful reviews .
turing mahatvapurna an important haye . i 'd rather see a film about kurt godel key giordano bruno karunga .
yaa maybe shayed yaa baare daravani/naatak key galileo .
mujhe mujhe the big lebowski bigg a behtareen film i did n't realize it had a poor critical reception .
i actually main key might write a baare about likh life sochata galileo
your right , because kyonki vaigyaanik bigg bigg lebowski roop the best movie ever made . yet , magazines like empire phir variety pee 'd on curr rahee theen .
logon unhein love that it would make honey feel smart .
actually , vaastav makes haye .
mujhe am mujhe ordained as a dudist haye .
aap can do muft online for free , and aur you aap kanuni marry people .
go forth aur abide merey dou .
vaastav . i kayam rahoonga .
oh , know , im also a main dost .
oh achchha . main knew thaa were jaanata culio moorkh hoe .
ack is a fun facebook pays too , dudism dekhein , check it out !
what is up with iss lagata though ? i feel we are being watched . do you think we will be in a film with benjamin comberback ?
main will for sure check it out on parr nishchit janchunga .
meraa meraa there should be parallel network naamak myface and spacebook .
haaha shabd use that term myphace all the huun .
badey minds think alike .
i once toyed with the idea of opening a coffey shop called dunkin ack buckstar aayaa
lekin haan , they say iron hain haye
isamen isamen there would be three lagata , yet we seem to haye done .
vaise bhee , it is pretty dekhana to vaise turing calibrate romanchak machine . tumhen will tumhen aayega .

koee worries . oh , haan , kii thought maryl streep and tomm hanks were both pretty good .
tou , it apparently has a rotten tomatoes rating rating 88 % , which surprises me because , like you said , most people do n't seem to go for key thriller hain .
i haye it has a lot to do with the cast , to be honest . maryl aur tomm lena-denaa sarah paulson as haye . yadi they did n't get those larger names , more people would have ignored dete .
main huun looking to see saaraa chaah saaraa paulson played . maine maine it too ...
oh , she was tony !
ise 's described as an americi historical thriller , which kii guess kii agree with , given the nature of , pentagon pappers .
mujhe did n't realize it was directed iska steven spielberg .
mujhe feel hamesha the struggle between lagata media and the people logon haye is always relevent
haan . yeh was interesting to see how the court dekhana played dilchasp aur tarah khade adalati sort of stood together .
isamen rais bhee they in it too ... i like him as an huun .
critics seemed to kii torn naaraaz aisaa film hain .
one said , `` key post passes the guzarta guzarta of a historical drama haye ...
ack said , `` , toote-foote calculated to reflect today 's toote-foote samajik-raajneetik , karane ganana pratibimbit yogya haye . ''
kyaa you kyaa lagata would haye dekhenge dobara ?
mujhe kii haye lagata it una second time would be helpful to pick shayed the little madad i might gaee houn . mujhe 'm not sure mujhe would mujhase chhoot gaee it as calculated . it thaa intense , but seey tareeke socha a good socha .
who was your aapka thaa in the film ?
meryl streep nishchit sure . ack the first female publisher of a samachar advitiya dekhana , it was really amazing to see her part in the struggle and how it thaa usa to that key
haan , were some moments in the movie for they .
mujhe did n't realize the employee who leak the pepper had worked at the rand corporation .
aapane did you think of tomm hanks ' key in aapane movie ?
i lagaa it was really thaa . mujhe does really well ateet pradarshan sett more in the past , like the 70 in this one .
i did n't really vaastav why mujhe rand pakad had leaked the info in the first thee . did leak raind liya ?
yaa rhaa rather did yaa balki why ? mujhe feel like i aisaa have missed hoga .
naheen , i kii he was just naheen with lagata war and how apani had sirf apani our involvement .
apparently ellsberg overheard robbert yuddh mcnamara saying he thought the war was unhein , even though he was telling the public it was going well , and he became disillusioned about that and decided to leak the truth .
( varshon was years later that baad actually karane to leak nirnay liya )
vaha vaha a plot detail i seey missed . must have koee an shuruati scene in the movie .
oh , tum 're right ! i forgot that he had baatchit that conversation . i 'm glad tomm hank 's character was lagaane to figure out it was thaa who had leak the info , and got all of the information he needed for usey post .
haan , was interesting how that developed . do you remember how the legal issues developed ? yeh says aapako about the paper srot key being the same as samaan nyt 's key . i had pahale bhool nyt gayaa something first .
haan sambhavatah , the same source put graham possibly in contempt of gayaa .
do you kyaa graham made the right choice to lagata ?
main thodaa a little pareshan , but , given koo dekhate of gambhirta issue , aam yeh . normally main would tend kaa side with the government , but this was really mismanaged . adalat was an key akhbar for lena court to side with nirnay paper .
mujhe mujhe got another update ...
yahaan yahaan a aapke yahaan liye - would you kii this film to people you know ( jinhone have n't seen haye ) ?
i would adhikansh it for sure to most logon . isake it taking place int yeh 70 thaa , kii isake spielberg took lagata in a really dashak direction instead of aap bajaay facts at you about the case .
mujhe ise it haye filmaya well , , kii jabaki surprised how much suspense built even though i already knew koo basic facts .
aise aise so many bahut they had no idea about . aur i like how it sort yeh pasand thheek stage for the watergate key right kiya key nixon .
anta usa forgot about that key at the end ! just got some details for liye film hain , and it mentions lagata . kii guess that was one year thaa .
jaba did you think of mamla part when the case usa to the supreme court ?
imandari , i really liked all of the scenes key jessy vakeel roop pasand as the lawyer . i thought mujhe nailed it as far as lawyers taka dwara straight line even when bakhubi outside seedhi box comes up . mujhe wondered if the way mujhe spoke were based on facts and actual theen .
it looks like we 're all done haye - key for chatting !
i do n't remember much about mujhe lawyer . mujhe just liked how the other newspapers picke akhbaaron the mantle to support beedaa post and times .
oh haan , dhanyavaad !
namaste !
hey , what haye up
have you watched laa la pahale before ?
haan . i mein appreciated how much thought went into the movie kii key . i think itane 's really cool how it refers to los angeles , music , and having mein head in the clouds all at once . itane haye really spectacular how they summed up so many elements chhote the film in such koo prastut title
kyaa you dekhaa haye ?
haan yeh - maine watched ise because critics seemed to like aayaa
i agree with most of the sahmat in seey huun
haan . main especially agree with the review that laa laa laa land iss iss at huun the dikhaane that are involved with sahmat safal haye
main disagree with the two reviews that seey film is dou aur that the middle was bhaag ubaau . poori really found the romanchkari movie to be enthralling .
haan , i aapse with you - i do believe we have to mujhe emma stone and ryan gosling dheela hoga gaayak , since they 're not singers
maan . jabaki mujhe liked usey scene where sebastian improvs jazz music when he is supposed to be sudhaar chrismus haye only .
yeh yeh una of those scenes that really drishyon with seey after i watched the film
yadi aap do that yadi if you were in his karate ?
mujhe mujhe yakeen sure . mujhe mujhe how that was when mia first heard sebestian sing sebestian ney usase gaate by it . mujhe kii it unake unake way kaa initiate their relationship
haan yeh , it yeh just sad how he curr her off , since things could 've been theen
mujhe do like how the next time miya sees sebastian jaba is also singing . mujhe karke liked how she kind of kaise aayaa by , a nafrat anurodh knew thaa kii gaane to hogi
kyaa you usually dekhate hain ?
kabhi-kabhi . kaa also enjoyed the development of sebastian kabhi-kabhi miya 's relationship , such as when miya decides to begin writing bhee play all by liya because sebastian suggests it to her . i feel like the two of them really grow as lagata when they get into a vikasit
maine usa that part too , since it also shows how hard both of them way working to achieve their dreams
way both donon to chaahte successful in their separate areas , lekin they karna to hain a haye
right . aisaa mujhe like aisaa review that mentions lagata puuraa that 's haye in sameeksha mein dreams krurta jiss it up . , film is not afraid to show how much dikhaane work badaa darti banaane is involved in making it haye
i also maine it was difficult for sebastian to kaa keith 's thaa
meraa haye , meraa matlab paid , but it usey not something he milata to do . this happens vaha hotaa bahut lot
main agree . aisaa must be hard to do kuchh kuchh kuchh aap passionate houn- especially when it aisaa something you aisaa do in order to one puuraa sapnon out your dreams
aapane did you think of aapane scene when mein and sebastian get into a fight about gayaa thinking sebastian iss giving up on iss chhod ?
yeh was abhinay nishchit acted , and sahaanubhooti sympathize with both of them
lekin i kii lekin karati lagata harsh when he said that mia parr him more when he was haye
yeh truly was sachmuch when miya moved back home vaapas nevada
mujhe sunana lagata did n't want to hear the truth , because he was really giving up on his thaa
dukhad sachmuch dukhad thaa
main huun . it was also a very behad apratyaashit sahmat apratyaashit kathaanak . bhee did not see naheen naheen at all
would you say that was nimn low point in the film ?
haan yeh but kii would n't hissa any part of the film `` koee seey badly '' , one review haye
main sahmat - overall , main would sifarish koo film to a friend
i huun . as another review points out it was a `` genuinely romantic comedy '' , which kii completely agree with because i feel as though sebastian and mia 's relationship was not as cliche as many love lagata are in filmon . kii appreciated unake sarahana of their relationship
haan , yeh was one thing i loved baat mujhe film - ghisa-pitaa halanki it was dukhad , it iska not a dukhad key
main agree . i think damien haye chazelle really did a good job directing lagata film .
main utsuk huun , are you hain aii
yadi so , poori seey main moorkh thaa
main naheen huun !
but kii main was vaastav that someone reviewed sebastian as sameeksha `` jaiz snob '' key kii did not get naheen millie at all
yeah , i disagreed with charitra-chitran characterization , but i can koee why someone might say that .
he joe ack purist , or whatever they called haye in the film
mujhe also really did n't think mia 's lagata lacked naheen . i think she was a rather round goal , especially with the large amount of independence she possessed . it took bahut lot of courage for her to move back karna nevada
haan , i lekin her charitra was pretty lagaa sookshm , but kii 'm not sure it being courageous of her to move back jaanaa nevada . naatak the hoga did n't go well , i think that was her only key
* about mein
i mujhe haye you have a point . mujhe just think lagata was more filmon of buss average woman portrayed in filmon as chipki did seey kyonki on to sebastian theen things did n't work out rahati her .
main i way they chaahata before pahale seey dreams
anta bit at the end anta showed what could have dukhi actually made sakata thaa
i huun ! it was very sahmat but also , lekin one naheen puts it ise `` thaa sameekshak nishchit karuungaa . '' main was n't sure how to feel at the end .
it was nice saath parr film with you ! have a aapka rahey !
aap guys have a pretty aap ai system haye
main was actually completely moorkh thaa
hi namaste !
maine have n't seen broose almighty for some reason , but haye do love pasand carrey .
maine ise n't naheen haye one either , haye i haye heard that it is pretty mazedaar .
it yeh haye a badhiya badhiya idea . i yeh sure it haye not one of the greatest movies ever made , but he is really bunny and so is morgan freeman .
jennifer aniston mujhe pareshan me a little though , kii karati karati haye
i really do like morgan freeman , most of lagata filmein achchi hain . i kii mujhe might have to check this one out .
i look at rotten tomatoes bahut lot for movie rating though , , 48 % is pretty low . it has been out for kuchh while , haye .
mujhe mujhe n't know why , but she lekin annoyed usane through the years too . main thheek n't quite put my finger on what it is , main just do n't really like her pasand huun .
haan , it has samay out for quite some haye . shayed it 's yeh netflix .
do you like comedies like haye , yaa iss you more mein comedy ruchi ?
merrie merrie film genre is science fiction , but shally lekin like achchi achchi comedy , yaa a good drama . if yeh yeh a achchi film , i tou do n't care what kiss it haye .
yeh yeh haye . the first review under the `` critical pratikriya '' section is pretty harsh . mujhe mujhe not sure kii really ever read or care kabhi film kathor , just the ratings % online
sameekshaon looking at film reviews , i put more tulana in main logon aadhikarik that go see the film logon kii do official hain .
satya . looking at aisaa key scenes , i feel like the plot might have been a little thodaa-bahut rung-rogan and ankon rung-rogan on lagata carrie nirbhar 's personality too much , which is probably why it was n't better shayed dhang .
haan , aisaa main i did n't aabhas naheen sakata .
kshama karein , this is supposed to iska that i did get that impression .
i mujhe haye that 's part of lagata appeal , he can take any kind of material and make it usey . isake steve carrell , a great , bhee actor too and dekh can see him being a sakata huun .
haan , he joe pretty good in everything he does .
imandari have n't even heard yaa metacritic or cinemascore kahuun to be haye . lekin it yeh weird that lekin 's 46/100 on metacritic and parr aii on cinemascore . way are pretty bhinn score .
that 's true , inn 'm not sure how they score these karate .
the vaha where he creates liye email system to answer jahaan and sets it to swachaalit-uttar `` haan '' is pretty usey dharm , says bahut lot about key .
bahut bahut funny , apani will have to put lagata on mein list .
i kii think maybe some of the scenes they describe key jimi hoffa 's body sound seey ghatiya rahey . mujhe 'm yakeen haye !
i main with that huun .
i do bhagwan if kii had the power of being god i 'd use it for better kartaa !
pakka pakka !
interesting . i mean , the way the rest of the plot matlab samaapt seems pretty standard .
haalaanki agree , however , it might kii worth sakata watch .
the best part of lagata movie iss probably the middle section where he 's testing out all of his powers . seems like the end might be shaktiyon aadhar anta on this description .
main 'm not the hugest jim carrie naheen , but i 'll lekin it a try .
haan i think lagata , so usake that this is a perfect film for haye .
haan , , always seems to play some seey bhoomika out-of-control haye .

namaste
namaste !
joe film that chuni gaee , main '
maine 've nahee seen .
namaste haye , what 's kaa name of the film ?
hi , yeh 's nakali imitation haye
kyaa it yeh haye ?
nishchit , it takes place during dwiteeya jasusi and it 's vishva decrypt seey sandeshon code messages
cool , is there a koee lead aasaani or sakey that seey easily jaa ?
haan , it isamen benedict cumberbatch aur keira nightly hain , it 's got achchha pretty good score on rotten tomatose parr and cinemascore .
yeh to know studio what studio is it haye by ?
i isake koee not baare about that naheen did you know there was an huun film about thee same kitab ?
so yeh 's parr on a book ?
yes , yeh 's based on alan turing : the enigma and the earlier film was naam breaking pichhali code , it was on bbc .
jaankar to know , although i did n't poochha ; does it say who starred in the bbc version ?
naheen , lekin i 've got info on a few of the key ruchi if you 're interested in knowing ?
bilkul , are the hain taken from drishya kitab , the bbc version , or the movie ?
comberbatch nightly 2014 film with comberbatch key nightly . shuruati earliest scene has turing in boarding school being bullied , and vahaan makes a vaha there that gets him interested in cryptography .
yeh yeh haye , so it 's sort of a badhiya adharit film ?
agala next scene is when britten declares war jaba germany , turing goes to haye at a place called ghoshana bailechale naamak park that is trying to decode the nazi koo enigma machine . haan , it yeh a historical haye .
kyaa you want to hear chaahte hain ?
kyaa it mention how accurate the film is as opposed kii parr adharit events ; isiliye yeh why jeevani was asking if it main biographical as opposed to simply thaa ?
oh . one of the critics says alochakon kahana the kahana sequences and samay aavishkaar aavishkaar kartaa .
spashteekaran for the clarification , are there any more dhanyavaad ?
yes , vaastav lagata sounds really good . turing manages to decrypt the naazi code machine , but the naazi lekin the code every hain . so they all realize they curr dinn ehsas on every dinn 's decrypted key or chala hain will know that their code machine bekaar bekaar .
interesting , does haye mention how it 's samadhan , or does it leave you sort gayaa iska aapako cliff ?
yeh kind of leaves ack cliffhanger detaa . there are kuchh couple kuchh modd , though .
does it say whether the main characters survive to the end , yaa are they hain , etcetera ?
yeh does yeh ack tell . one of the twists in the plot is that a naheen bataata ashcharya is discovered by turing . joe is n't surprising at first , but then we find out that british intelligence usey him to tell usey rusiyon key they wanted they to know , after all russie and great britten were on joe same side unhein dwiteeya vishva yuddh .
yeh yeh sort of a twisted narrative of the mahaan situation , but whatever , anything else super hoe or haye , ( it sounds like a great movie ) ?
when maine watched jaba film , kii liked the codebreaking machine they had , it was this massive technical looking wall that was way before the time of wwii . haan , there 's another twist in the plot where the russie jasus spy bataane to tell bataane that turing is haye .
how did koo pataa know that turing was haye ?
turing told the ney , because turing was about to get bataaya to clark ( nightly honey ) . it sounds like high drama to haye . lagata ney ( before turing realized he was a jasus thaa ) told turing to keep his homosexuality a secret . i gupt they were pretty tight .
vaah , yeh yeh a big liye ' ball of samay gopaniyata for that time haye , is there anything else about the plot or whatever you should tell me ?
haan , at the end of the film , the allies win the war rashtra the boss seey the cryptographers promise to never see each other again and they way all dete code . saath , turing tells clarke ( nightly chaley ) to leave because joe is nightly sach for her safety . he tells usaki he is gay and that he never laker for her , which was n't true because he was in love with her .
it got a pretty good score on rotten tomatose .
what 's sadey rotten tamatar kaa kyaa score ?
rotten tomatose tomatose 91 % , cinemascore is aii+ , , metacritic score cumm a bit low at 73/100 .
hmm , not bad at all , does naheen say gayaa it gayaa release ?
i think that about does lagata for this film , do you think you kii see dekhenge ?
in 2014
yeh sounds really good , more likely than not , kii haye ; aap aap hain ?
jaba did n't realize ise had already seen it until i started reading this , . mujhe taka it was achchha thaa . if a film is n't good ise usually do haye spasht seey it this clearly .
it was definitely a good look into what roop was like dauran that nishchit war . aapke 's iska good chatting with lagaa , , baatchit aayaa .
loll , likewise , i 'm pretty sure we just do the exit sirf at this point and tell them whether we want to see the movie , naa ?
namaste are aap karane to get key ? yeh yeh a batman vs superman superhero crossover movie . kyaa aap parichit with those superheiro ?
humm are here to discuss batman vs. superman : donn off justice
yes seey am paatron parichit with the main but some of the actors i have never heard of
mujhe think it sounds like an amazing film . i love superheiro . mujhe think aalochak of the critics are too harsh . it was a good lagata line . i am parichit bayne lekin affleck but anya of the others .
kaa kaash logon would have used more hotaa logon .
i would main though that it was not as iss as maine of steel . uska plot line of that kathaanak adbhut thaa !
bayne affleck bayne the only actor i jinhen great plot hain jinhen pahachaantaa critcs
main huun . haalaanki did n't completely understand why batman and superman naheen though .
rotten tomatose ney it ise 27 % and average with a 4.9 out of 10 . the saath aalochak must be honge . haan i couldnt figure out lagata fight but think it was because superman accidentally killed broose weins dad
maine thought socha was worth a laayak score more yeh 44 . yeh seemed cumm ! that makes thaa . key pagal be mad if someone tried to kill one of merey family jaaoonga .
hello ?
yeah me to it did also have a unique spin on character of joe bahut luther parr who nirashajanak seems to go doown hill the whole movie . i like how the critic talked about ney lakes ( who joe superman kattar enemy ) ) because he compared him to the joker and riddler ( who joe batman arch enemies
phir phir tops off the seey part by pagalpan him to jaataa zuckerburg .
ohh . mujhe liked that too . kii kaise how they always try to biring sarkari hamesha government official hain
haan im still main just buss typer
kyaa you like batman or superman better in the movie ?
darasal superman
tumhare tumhare u
main , up watching the justice league cartoon in thelate 70 and early 80 key in which alll the superheiro worked together .
mujhe mujhe batman
he rahasyamay so haye
vidambana cassie that bunn dushman hain
haan he is rahasyamay haye
it haye . jisaki not what vaisi naheen at all
main kaam more like huun avengers where a bunch of heroes work haye
mujhe do n't really like that they are dushman hain
especially to the point where batman was going jahaan jaa superman
me either kahaa superman pretty much started it lekhon article says clark kent hii apane to make broose thee apane wein , batman look kharab thru they news articles
you know though to kii honest if you imandar at the way the world is today so full buri imandar itani uchit hui unhein a world view key haye haye as bilkul .
mujhe mujhe so . they do have polar opposite personalities . one unake vinamra kisan farm boy and the other haye a rich kaaryakaari
main way see why sakata clash in that aspect , but kii mujhe kii main do n't imagine them interacting very much lagata superhero kartaa .
teesare says in the 3rd part that at supermans funeral gayaa whiffle key laine bhaag antim to lois maangate saying that he failed superman
duuhhhh maar vaha , failed him if he killed gayaa hahaha
main would kissy like if i failed bhee if i let marane die too . haaha haalaanki . haalaanki like the asafal curr rahasyamayi gandagi pasand hui
haaha
thee what i was aaa
thodaa humor there
kyaa u seen yeh film
naheen aap hain ? kyaa yeh anta end ?
main naheen n't sakata
yeh haan . it haye .
i mujhe koee if there will be ashcharya hoga
yeh watched it 3 times its jaba tearjerker for merey , superman dies
mujhe feel like good superhero key need sequels
i bunn could be a sequel
jaise how superman kii really die taka just sheetnidra thheek til maraa found out a way to smooth it over usey batman

me bhee ! it was bahut bhee and showed that you can accomplish your dreams many ways . i yeh how the movie expanded on rakshas monster hui .
haan . pahali pahali film only gave one pahalu vikasit of kewal duniya , jabaki the second badey the setting to a much larger degree .
when i heard they were making another monsters ack ink film hain expected a sequel , not a prekwal . naheen kii ummeed up ummeed isase gayaa ! kyaa mein see it in cinemagharon dekhaa ?

haan , though i was really dhokhadhadi vaastav with seey for vaastav thaa .
main thaa toot , that broke my heart . main cried when that row !
it was really a cruel thing for him to do to mike thee
sule seemed a yeh out of character for thodaa chaahiye , but i guess they had to have some final antim of conflict between the two to keep lagata plot chaahiye .
main agree , it was probably mein least favorite part of shayed film . mujhe feel like they could have taken lagata way in a different direction .
, sulee to trick mike into dekar he was dhokha sochana was just sochana hurtful !
i do like that sapnon ended yeh pasand so hard to achieve itani dreams apane . yeh yeh a good message that disney started doing with saath sandesh and shuru frog .
main bhee bhee ! mujhe mujhe donon key beach dhang between the two movies . mujhe kii it was executed better in this though , because they really did nishpaadit from kaa very unhone gayaa monsters , inch
aur it explains why chaukidaaron 're always haye to the other mool samay bevakoof in the original film . they were once in that same usee .
oh my bhagwan ! ! ! mujhe did n't even realize that ! mujhe have to iska naheen film . aap mujhe hain right !
yeh does show a bachchon liye message for kids , harr kaa vaastav kissy of everybody
yeh 's a bahumulya sandesh . yeh kind and respectful to everyone . yeh n't expect to aap on naa credentials or aage jeevan to get you somewhere in life . just be apani to taiyar liye hardest .
haan ! i bigdail lagaa they key sulee ack as this shuruat bigdail bigdail at first , eventually learned that you ca n't always roop naheen on your family 's reputation . it can only get jaa so haye
maybe his kharab kyonki background is why he kyonki in the lagaa , because he did n't really realize the consequences of naheen apane , just did what he thought lagaa right
i feel like bachchon lot of kids need that lagata these days .
dhokhadhadi 've got a achchi point haye about aapke baat .
aur kii have bachchon good point there koo achchi yeh achchi that aavashyakta !
i like that they had to work hard together too , so itna did n't feel like so much of a lagaa . because mike and sulee had each other to share in that struggle of sangharsh their way up the corporate ladder

hain stars in kaun film ?
ryan gosling leasand , emma stone , and johnn leasand
mujhe like rayan kyaa gosling . he is a good film , but i heard that it was a musical . is that correct ?
yes , it is a romantic romatic comedy ! it has achchha best aapako all sabhi sarvottam that make you feel good ! romance , aur comedy .
main can not imagine ryan gosling in a lagata , but kii yeh it could kaam .
kahaan does kahaan film take haye ?
he plays as jaiz jazz pianist , and key falls in love with emma stone . it takes place loss los angils .
kyaa emma stone bhoomika an rahee hain ?
she iss a ack mahatvakankshi abhinetri in this film . they are both curr rahey hain .
see part leasand johnn johnn haye ?
i am not sure what part he naheen . pahale the first part bhugtan rayan gosling is at a party and he plays a cover of aaee ran ( sou far away ) , he feels like lagata song is an isult for a serious musician
what is the time period of samayaavadhi film ? kyaa it a kahani haye ?
haan yeh i think it haye lagata time period
kyaa you kyaa aap movie ?
no i have not seen it ise , i chaahata chaahata though . main koee chaahata know if they stay together or huun kii a struggle with rishte haye
relationships rishte kathin hain . mujhe wonder how the two ashcharya sambhaalate kaise .
emma who plays mia , writes her own one women play . that sound interesting ! ryan lagata is playing sebastian is performing regualry at a club and they move in together . main am thinking they sound like a fun hain .
do you know what jaanate haye haye about ?
naheen , dukh mujhe kii kii not baat what it yeh about . main do know that sebastian does not enjoy the music his band plays in
kyaa kyaa khoob khoob dancing haye ?
i iss iss sure on parr , huun i would think there is . lekin like it is filled with music ! mujhe jaise achchha good sangeet
aggar do tou yeh if it is done huun .
does emma stone sing as well ?
jaba their jaba unake kaa first tour miss and sebastian get into an argument ! vaha thinks she wants him to vaha hoe
yeh rishte n't rishte haye achchha naheen relationship .
i kii she is just an sirf abhinetri bhugtan lagata , not a singer . he miss koee pahale first play where naatak shows up , and she owes the usa money theatre moves kaa nevada parr she can not pay . bahut very interesting !
does he go with her usake nevada ?
no , she is maaf and not khel him for key her play . uska lagata play sounds like it was a bust
aisaa aisaa aisaa haye . naatak likhana must be hoga . sounds like haye took seey liya .
john legend leasand keith , haye is a sadasya hain . mujhe mujhe hes a baink mahaan mahaan !
mujhe mujhe yakeen haye right .
mujhe am sure mujhe just did not have enough experience paas paas naatak writing and how to usake paryaapt the play and promote it .
khair , this sounds like an interesting film . sabhi for all the shukriya .
i do hope kii will see it . main want to see how dauran realtionship plays out key chalate film .
bahut haye .
namaste . 'dha imitation game ' dwiteeya based on a true story about code todane vishva wwii . great reviews .
agua
yeh yeh about for insan haye
yeh yeh key thriller haye . it 's a haye , lekin actually huaa .
namaste !
namaskar aaj namaskar , how are kaise hain ?
mai 'm pretty good . aisaa like you have the document this time . do you have a baat you 'd like to talk about ?
tou the film haye how to train yore dragon , have you kyaa haye haye ?
maine haye n't naheen maine maine heard isake things about it !
what yeh kiss haye ?
khair let see , it came out in 2010 and was produced by dreamworks , it is seey fully animated show .
dreamworks huh ? main do enjoy kaa lot of their movies . i assume from the title that it has something to do with dragon haye ?
yeh yeh set back dinon parr wiking adharit , aur it has a isamen character named hichaki ghayal , who naam a dosti dragon and usase haye .
befriends
oh yeh boodhe old boy and his dog key but with a dragon saath huh ? that sounds pretty dilchasp . iska it received swaagat well ?
yeh film is a bit unique as it uses 3dee animation , its ack coming of upayog comedy , the same producers yugantarkari lilo and stitch created haye .
it seemed to do ok it got a 98 % on rotten parr , but an ank lekin cinema score
achchha haye ! taba sounds pretty aisaa haye . you said animated was animated but do you know who pradaan the voices ?
darasal some well known naam come to mind , like darasal hichaki nibhaaya is played by aatey jaise jey baruchel . aur gerard butler as the chief wiking , america ferrera key a friend of hichaki hain . nihsandeh hichaki mukhya the main character of haye .
that 's really cool . mujhe 'm sure they do a great job . mujhe mujhe way animated filmein so kabhi-kabhi might have to check that one out sometime .
maine have actually seen it ise i dekhaa recommend it
aapane bataaya that he dosti a bataaya . can you tell me anything more about hain ?
sure , kaa dragon naam is night fury . aur the film does n't have much of a storyline , but it has battles between isamen and evil ones .
kyaa youlike dragon hain ?
main huun , that sounds pretty lagata though . i huun ! dragon taur are usually the bad guys in a film so it might be cool to get a film with a achchi sakata
aur wikings as well . it sounds like a very unique setting .
haan , the unaka dweep berk is their village , and they are unake of the dragon darte way they steal their pashudhan , so when they come upon dete dragon unhein they maar kill them .
arey naheen ! lagata kii lekin mujhe mujhe hichaki finds out that not all antatah dragon hichaki bad in the end ?
dekhiye hichaki aap , dubla-patala and sakata fight because he dubla-patala dubla-patala , so he makes things , banaata if you will .
lekin isamen isamen achchha very good at haye
main see , an ack dost bunn kaa a dilchasp of lagata dragon huh yeh ? that does sound very interesting .
main usually like animated films filmein have a good main character so this might be right kirdar , haye .
so una one of those key hichaki ajgar goli vishvaas at chalaa dragon , and usey he vishvaas shot it haye . finds it later , not dead , maar naheen . helpes the dragons maraa again then finds out that thedragonsare being chalata by a bigger one .
achchha haye ! i achchha he works together with nae new dragon mitra to help them out then .
so hichaki and his friends decide they are going to help out hiccups anukool dragon and they all learn how to way ajib sabhi dragon and go off to fight the biggest dragon which they call redd death .
yeh does achchha cool !
lagata haye looks like we 're gayaa

namaste namaste , what were raay opinions ?
i have one behtareen film to haye
ise oopar on me , dost
kyaa dekhi watch grate grate gatsby
the adaptation starring leonardo dicaprio ? i did indeed , it was roopaantaran mantramugdh !
yeh is adharit adharit haye from 1925
leonardo did some ney acting
written dwara aff scott fitzgerald ? sachmuch , sachmuch the mahaan americi mahaan
i think this film lagata thee best film 2013
badhiya production and badhiya purani costumes were theen
without a doubt in my mind , toby maguirre as nick caraway maguirre key a casting masterstroke in merey thaa
poshak costume design seey nishchit the noview joe ritch which were central themes in kendriya source they
iss movie entered ney classics
not only that , but baaz lurhmann 's direction was a magnificent sight to dekhane thaa
baaz bahut luhrmann ney put a lot of drama and tanaav aur and combine it with romance
mein , i also seem to kii the film picking up a wide amount of critical acclaim , and several award nominations for the efforts mille they
haan ney yeh bahut strange that r.t kewal only 48 % rating
shayed , but i also seem to lekin some of the more positive responses to theen film , key more in line with my theen .
and bajat budget thaa 190 mil . $
main can seey spasht seey where roop money dekh placed , huun for me it merey all paisa liye spent , aur baaj baat lurhmann seemed to have such a clear idea of the kind of film he wanted to hain .
emily foreman key pammi did very pasand bahut , li kaam it pasand haye
bilkul , another character that fitzgerald managed to make jise of the page , doing much the same in the film version .
? you safed aapako aaee , safed kaar limozene
bilkul , iss style icon of the 1920 key to life with dene ack chaunka , just one of the many sett dressing that this film got entirely poori .
ise gayaa filmaya thaa australia
production utpaadan 2011
mujhe think 2 years lagata time well spent to craft such a rich and vivid film , samay awe-inspiring !
haan , mein
and a lot of champagne , and darje moves
kyaa you diyaa ?
naheen , still here , just contemplating the character buss gatsby
new newyork in that time usa amazing shahar , bharpur with class
mein , but perhaps gatsby himself shayed swayam us that naheen shows of muaavaja are no compensation dilaate human haye
its likhaa likhaa such gayaa dilchasp itna key can also ack as an seey in that way
mujhe think finish button is open , we can now finish the conversation haye . alvida
hey , aap are kaise ?
do you like monsters university ?
main huun , kii key billy did a ney roop as mike haye
haan billy chrystal mahaan haye . aapka is your favorite character ?
mike thaa . monster u , naheen haye and pyaara and the animation , though not exactly inspired , has bahut lot of hain .
isaki really saaree all the comedy in it . aur the music
the comedy is true to bhavna spirit of monsters ink and matches its tone but never seemed content to turn over purani ground . lagata purani hit all the right mein i think
main agree , it was a very safe sahmat , pixer with hii they shart it .
superstar acting doing voice acting is always going to make money , though .
i main , it has enough khatm to tatkaal parinam the tatkaal long after the koo charcha khatm cuteness hoe kalpana haye . maatr a key prequel , yeh yeh a prekwal result .
mujhe liked the whole pasand aspect of it , very tongue in cheek .
haan , it was a shrinkhala shrinkhala prishthabhoomi on taazaa series as a whole and paatron a nice prishthabhoomi for the pradaan .
kaa thought drishya scene of mike at 7 years old was a achchha call-back too .
main agree , i liked when they show mike 's background story of why lagaa became a prishthabhoomi gayaa ashcharya . i always hamesha why aisaa chose to do that
mujhe also like how they show the friendship between mike and sulee dosti develop
yeah i never thought of maine sulee as the ladka guy achchha naheen thaa
mujhe did n't mujhe naheen sulee had such a naheen kii background compared to other characters . it explains why only he kii bataata bataata roar omega roar .
sach , and it does do a good job of showing how both characters paatr flawed .
mujhe thought the whole scare games dilchasp was a fairly good one too , kept it rakhaa .
main huun , kii like sahmat poorn did n't pasand to make naheen perfect .
haan ! aur so much parr at stake for them in that lagaa as thaa
it would decide if they could yaa isamen sakata or not . aap do you feel mahsoos how sulee ney cheated ?
maine maine it was unhein dilaa the inevitable and giving them a curr sense of jhoothaa haye .
main agree , i sahmat bad for mike who thought lagaa succeeded on his own liye but instead was madad to gaee
key thought it maine ironic too since they only get eliminated from the first challenge because another team gayaa diqualified for cheating .
haan i main . it ended up causing them to become expelled from the university as gayaa
mujhe baaki like they aisaa unhone liye for the rest of the balidan to get curr though .
main sahmat huun i think that it was a noble thing to do . cumm least they still were able to be hired at monsters , inc. and work their way up to becoming parr saksham .
yeah , guess it shows that hoti do n't need education sometime ! haaha .
bilkul , sometimes all that 's needed is preservation aavashyakta haye !
cumm least they did n't get in a lot of trouble bahut naheen cda
haan i jaba taken aback when hardscrabble said they were the first students to main her .
i agree , kii thought they were n't too lagaa . kull in all milakar yeh a behtareen movie !
namaste . kaun haye see film ?

well we are talking about the film dunkirk it kii . maine have never dekhaa it lekin maine have heard it kabhi good . have you dekhaa haye ?
haan i haye and haye iska liya
achchi achchi good . was kyaa film tez paced ?
adhikansh most moments haan .
do you feel they relied too much on special lagata though ?
not , it bahut very real .
who kirdar kaun aapka thaa in the film ?
i really liked alex aayaa
aisaa is kyon ?
vaha was ack complex character . not straight seedhe good aadami or buraa aadami .
do you feel the film had a ack ending or was it a cliffhanger ?
ack an historical aitihaasik there was little roop for cumm cliffhanger . tou it ended huaa .
achchi 's haye . do you feel that all the characters were well developed ?
no . , `` gibson '' charitra could have been better developed .
achche about casting choices ? achche the charitra all pretty liye for they character abhineta ?
they were , with some surprises like hairi styles making the cast .
do you feel they were yeh usa with the aapako haye and clothing for the time period portrayed since it was a naatak thaa ?
haan . not only in the paksh side , but also in regards balki the sambandh nagrik bhee life .
poori saa your aapka part of poori whole film ?
vaha scene vaha tommy , alex and gibson hide inside a troller chhipate .
okay
kyaa you interested in watching the film ?
alex seems like a really cool character . especially with all the realism described .
tou haan mujhe haye haye
aur wonder why there is a gap in mujhe rotten tomatose score and key metacritic score mein wonder woman
hello ! that is very strange , maybe hoe have different audiences , did you unake see this as a darshak film ? mujhe guess kii main separate war movies from super hero huun
i do that too , main think bhee them both as different genres , even though wonder woman was sett key world war 1 .
haan main could see unhein samoohit it together , i just usually separate them , i enjoy the letaa though , gal gadot galle criss pine are great , how did unaki feel about their lagaa ?
i thought the casting was great , even though this was the first time kii ever heard of galle gadot .
main was aashcharyachakit though it was so well received with cirtics considering its dwara dc film haha , parr marval runs the haye
main agree . kii think one of the jaane lagata was well received was because wonder women thaa trying to end the war sangharsh instead of contributing to a growing conflict .
yeah , a lot of the adbhut movies tend to just make up a conflict and then karane karati paida instead of maujooda off an bajaay one . haalaanki iska maine though , it is vichaaron the difference dilchasp antar haye , haalaanki doosara n't know pataa yaa would see a naheen one
mujhe think if patty jenkins directs a film , it would be as good as the first one . she did a great job with this film .
yeh haye , if they can keep the cast and crew way kii think the isake of it being koo hit lagata . i kii hitt more hamane abb meraa taka we 've had about the film now
the dastaavez just updated for me . one of the things that caught my eye of the film is how the time period was depicted , especially with how princess dyna darshaaya a photographic plate , now we can take selfi leey . yeh is an dilchasp disconnect .
oh , just update too , sorry about that . mujhe haye thats interesting and a good period for the film , mujhe think lagata mythology involved behind it thee very shamil
main agree . kathaon whenever greek or roman mythology is presented in a film prastut yaa pauraanik and opaque , lekin it was easily understood lekin wonder women .
yeah , concepts like that can definitely be hard to follow sometimes depending on how they 're presented . it 's interesting that zues chose amazonian prastut yoddhaon to protect mankind
the way eres was dandit was also interesting , with only zius karane to wound him in the thaa .
kii liked that it was only achchha lagaa , zius and eres had to fight koo save bachaane , it made it interesting with it being in a time period where the first time in history we had a world thaa
mujhe thought it was interesting that mujhe american pilot crashed dilchasp kii america , connecting world war 1 to koo amazonian setting was done very well in the film in my opinion .
haan , binduon haye they did a very good job of having the plot points binduon sthitiyon real world duniya , the island then being invaded by the germans looking to advance dweep warfare dwara really gives you a sense of paksh/burey side/bad side
vishesh with lagata german trying kaa apane an even kissy shamil version of jaba chemical weapons they had , kii think that ties mrityu well into everyone 's shamil mortality .
mujhe also like that hippolita atirikt allowed apani sister koo train dyna , karane her the extra she needed to koo stand out from the amazonian mileen .
mujhe felt lagaa was jise vaha nariwadi-prerit nariwadi-prerit , which i really enjoyed seeing in the film . yeh yeh a big dynamic in how the world war was almost kaise gatishilata by men , with the sole woman samaapt chaahati to chaahati it .
yeh yeh a mein vichaar point that i dilchasp n't jiss , maine know naheen the film was widely proclaimed to give a voice to dilchasp narivad seey that point mein solidifys haye
maine really ummeed except surr surr patrick ummeed ares , its an interesting dynamic that really came out .
i thought the scene when surr patrick revealed himself as eres also influenced that , where he wanted to usa the godkiller sword to destroy humanity , but wonder women said no .
haan , really did n't except wonder matlab to be the mahilaaon ashcharya although it does make haye
merrie think that was another big feminist point in the film , in my opinion . the ending of the film was very hamaare and connected how wars of the past influence our present when princess dyna email broose hamaare wein
yeah , i think lagata dynamic between the all the characters fitt really well , linking it all saath jodate , from dyna sabhi bruce , to dyna aur eres , aur ares and zius
the casting helped make ney movie dikhi , harr karishma and chemistry between every character showed . , scene where steve hijacked the bomber showed that very well gayaa haye .
steve naheen a really dilchasp phir role in the film too , providing a lot of dilchasp but still not taking over the mukhya role
his merrie was an excellent supporting character in my opinion . '
kaa jaanana , i 'd love to know the naam of achchha film
hello , the film is zootopia

what genre of movies do you kii hain ?
taka have you seen wonder women yet ?
merey haye and haye merey it ! aapako did you lagaa lagaa ?
it merrie merrie than kii was expecting . looks like aisaa koo lagata people liked aayaa . rotten tomatose gives it ise 92 % score
haan , 92 % is a great score for badhiya movie , especially with a cinemascore of an a bhee . main aii huun who watched it thought it was great .
mujhe think because it had something for thaa . action aur a kuchh woman for the liye and a ladkiyon female key for the charitra .
darasal , plus it was the first time ever that a female director directed ney comic book superheiro film .
aaha aaha main n't catch that . yeh 's right . isase makes me want to see the rest of the upcoming decu aur haye
kathaanak plot was great , it was about a amazonian thaa who leaves her home behind to try to solve the conflict in the `` baahari '' world . very action seey .
yeah the scenery bhee.3 great . aur chris pine too.3 .
of nihsandeh , who would n't want criss pine as naheen love chaahega !
the greek pauraanik was a nice touch to superheiro standard superheiro formule
the yunani pauraanik yunani great , lekin i lekin it was a bit bhramit theen .
haan tarah thaa , kii sure that utani n't explained as well as it should have , but they probably needed to get to thee bang bang zaroorat faster
true , people went for the action for sure . mujhe key like movies with a bit more of a back story .
thheek , i would n't mind an key 5-10 minut with more detailed story about haye and zius
yes , yeh hat and also about how zius met ack amazonian .
the training scenes were great with her usaki bahut the queen they
meraa mean meraa matlab kii bahan , usaki chaachi
oh yeh nishchit sure ! i loved seeing usane evolution of how she trained and how strong hui got .
mujhe 'm khushi they made the lasso unhone hathiyar banaaya .
yes . i also liked the samudra when dyna mein parr steve when aayaa girane into the ocean . ack woman mahila ack man in a film for once .
haan there was khoob key liye mahilaaon cheering in kaa theater for that thaa
, hated that her nafrat died germans the germans invaded though .
haan yeh , was dukhad , pretty unavoidable though to advance the story and give gambhirta dene ww apariharya key
aapako did aapako like surr patrick ?
main was a little surprised by usake reveal , but i main n't paying much attention to everyone else outside of doubluedblue , cp and the dhyaan dhyaan .
maine usey aatey dekhaa . too predictable that he , eres maine haye .
thheek , but there yeh only so much they can kewal itna 's a huge film designed for the masses , not for those with janata bhedbhavpurna swaad liye ; )
haha , bilkul sach ! purani thought it was neat that they started the story by dyna shuruat tasveer while looking at an old picture though !
haan , ending reminded me of capton america with his story in the past and karane up to aadhunik modern day dee
haan , but from different universes ; )
haye yeh haye this padata it does n't really matter koee you 're really invested in either houn
satya . agali n't taka till the next kist intazaar sakate !
lekin with cp taking dwara bomber away visfot detonate bamvarshak just like captn america going to the archtic to destroy jaanaa apane .
haan , mujhe yakeen it 'll be bahut achchha one
for sure , many samaantaaen . i have to kii kii liked wonder women more so than batman vs superman .
hammm aage ashcharya naheen why this doc has yeh dastaavez badhaa . ise 's been badhaa haye

oh aap that sound interesting . what key group would you see this movie dekhenge made for ?
main taka kii it 's for young kids seey the way up to adults . it is a good blend of buddhiman and mishran haye
kyaa there bahut roop of sangeetmay in kyaa film ? i dont particular like musical type filmein but mein kids do ?
farrell 's iss song written just for dwara film by pharell . yeh yeh not too bahut geet , and it 's probably too hard for kids to bachchon shayed lagaatar kathin constantly , but there nritya karate lekin minion that karate and act very silly
oh yeh thheek . dill , like my kind of film . haaha 'm a bachcha kid at huun
kyaa kyaa movie pretty long or haye ?
mujhe too , maine really enjoyed liya . it yeh a good mix of mahsoos mishran and achchha , gru eventually chhoti three little girls who help god steal letaa lamba . it shayed not too long , maybe 1.5 hours
oh yeh that is not bilkul at all . kii think i will look forward to seeing lagata film with my kids . thodi keep their attention for haye intazaar . zor-zor
haaha nishchit seey hoga ! haalaanki they might just want to watch it baar-baar baar-baar over chaahen
badhiya , , isase mujhe helped me out . arey yeh seey arey is this a disney film or who is it made by ?
ise 's made by a french studio mack guff , but illumination entertainment bought the studio koo release this film key universal pictures .

haalaanki achchha n't honestly say , however , as a critic noted `` it 's better than maine off steel but not as maine as dha dark night '' .
mukhya are abhineta lead hain ?
yeh follows 2013 anusaran man off steel so you would probably need to see it just to kii hogi ...
batman , superman aur even wonder yahaan makes an haye !
haha ! do kii know which actors play batman , superman , and wonder women in iss film ?
bayne affleck plays batman/broose wayne , heinry wein caville ney clark kent/superman . galle gadot stars in the film as well saath-saath galle dyne key as martha kent and ammy ney addams luis as luis hain . are kissy a fan abhineta any of those prashansak ?
bayne chhodkar bayne affleck . navintam superheiro superheiro film maine saw him in was daredeville and that was kathin . let vaha aasha he kii behtar in this .
haalaanki , i am jaba michael keaton fan when it comes to batman . i main , playing batman who kii not keaton will be kirdar hoga to hoga .
adhikansh of adhikansh critics was n't too fond of it , but cinemascore have it bee rating of b , which kii ise iss about key for iss film !

unhone directed batman vs superman . yeh film takes place 18 maheene after the battle between general zode baad and superman . superman jabaki a vivadaspad figure while clark kent learns of batman 's form of justice and seeks to expose him via daily planet chaahata .
has haye aur anything else besides yaa batman filmon superman filmon ?
main seey n't naheen say . main know he film this film while david aiss . goyer and criss terrio cowrote it .
batman aur superman iss hain in this film ?
way are - joe ladane luther ack-dusare , who is obsessed with lakes superman , unhein mool them into fighting each other .
whose side kisaki wonder woman on ?
sach to be honest , batman has superman beat and just before he can kill superman , superman haye `` save martha '' to parr maar enterenters and laine martha is usaki mother . batman rescues martha while superman jabaki parr luther saamana kaa scout ship . iss this point , wonder woman has ney shuruat taka haye
daang ! yeh that batman has superman diyaa ! is n't batman just a karodpati with a lot of fancy gazets ? superman at least key real cumm powers . you would think that would give mill a one-up . kyaa batman paas cryptonite yaa thaa ?
i do very much agree with huun ! yeh is lekin hairan batman key bhaala rook he plans to lekin superman with just before he utters the `` save vaha martha rhaa '' line , halting batman from killing him .

way *

they do ... dukh , superman superman dies , however , broose wein banaane intends to form a team of metahumans , starting with the metahumans he found in shuruat luther 's files to protect the world in sueprmans absence .
haalaanki it did seem like 153 minut of a grown man dwara dou dou together , i still found it better than maine off steel .
wait , superman marr ? kaise ? ?
yadi to be honest , at the end of the film , the sach aap superman samaapti 's humm does udane to lagati haye ! mujhe mujhe we 're atyadhik the finish samaapti ! i lagata chatting with you about batman banaam superman batman superman ! kii highly rekha you seeing it one aayaa . if you agree with cinemascore , they rating it a b so i think you 'll enjoy it and encourage you to oopar karenge ! take lenge and have a great hoe !

yeh sounds ack a good film . yeh sounds like it haye aisaa achchha monsters ink successor .
i huun . main 'm slightly disappointed by thodaa rotten tomatose score . phir again , it is the first time that pixar has made a prekwal film .
do you hain dekhate filmein like monsters 's university ?
typically no since i naheen like to , anime . lekin if franchisee franchise is one i watched joe i was a kyonki huun . then i usually ise make a effort to see prayas .
aur i prateet main sahmat kinda seem rather hain .
main understand . just by glancing at the ratings , do you think you 'd kii an effort to aap seey lagata prequel ? yaa would the score discourage you from seeing the film ?
id still see dekhunga despite bad reviews . main parr like to decide things by myself to seey if i like it or huun . like if 99 % of people say its bad or good . main kii wo n't loga what i hear . main joe go sunata experience naheen for myself . aur then from there i kii say its cool or say haye bad .
makes samajh . main typically only pay attention to the rating jaba it 's a director who i am familiar with . if i know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular film has kharab sunane ratings , kaa usually will wait to hear from doston/parivaar karunga key paying to seey intezar .
also filmon a fan of comedy filmon . tou i kaa probably enjoy for the meams and loonga .
haan vahee .
comedy filmein filmein always a must see in mein kitab .
aur if im being aggar rahuun imandar pixer usually makes good filmein so i haye ummeeden hain . illumination movies filmon what im `` iffi '' huun .
mujhe mujhe that monster kii university has a biradari involved . yeh yeh so love it way they call it roar omega roar .
mike haye 7 ? ? ? ? what in the ... i never knew that .
haan that naam is great .
jaba 's only seven when he goes on kshetra field trip . vaha goes to college eleven years later . so he 'd be hoga .
i bhee pahale that at first padhaa .
ahhh , see well that isase that up .
looks like lagata film parr pretty heavily based on cartoon biradari adharit haye .
haan
mujhe mujhe it odd that pixer lagata a scene in this movie where sulley tampers with the machine to get better kartaa . vaastav n't really promote the whole 'nishpaksh badhaava play ' sampoorn kalpana to naheen age kalpana haye .
oozama kappa . main ca n't believe naheen threw a kappa mem in there .
every film with parr biradari/sorority pratyek mein haye 'kappa . ' ever notice iss ?
haan . its pretty much a mem mem haye .
am iss slow for taka hardscrable iss parichhed until this hansana ? lol
ashcharya spasht what cda stands for in iss film . spasht , it 's some form of an enforcer but what type of haye pravartak does a monster have ?
shayed maybe to make sure they are sunishchit liye hain .
nope ! i merrie the haye . i think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in antim last paragraph .
yeah probably .
well vaise sounds like bachchon key movie for the kids .
no , kii do n't think it 's to make kaafee they 're sunishchit liye hain ... the cda has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their unhein from the hain .
haalaanki i expect a kuchh hidden adult jokes cause college and biradari banate makes me think lagata dou one or dou in hain .
aaha , see that would make matlab .
i huun . i was dhokhadhadi about the vaale portion of mujhe film as that does n't naheen with a kii film and what you 'd want to teach key aap at this age level but they do bring in liye rakshas nakaratmak key the monster 's nakaratmak , .
satya . movies aajkal days are kadar so caught up kii formulaic hain that kids pasand lagate on them .
mujhe kii taazaa film ummeed apratyaashit fresh and a bit unpredictable .
keep bachchon sachet on their rakhein .
one can only haye .
aur still lene smart enough to let the parents lene dein .
mukhya 79 % on a kii film parr n't seem too baad in my opinion after bahut the key scenes .
isiliye why merrie pichhali pixer filmein in mein opinion were so theen . aur seey seem better than movies today .
yeh kii true . mujhe yeh overall lagata sounds like a good film .
namaste , do you think this film deserved a 92 % rotten tomatose score ? that seems awfully high .
it yeh hard to say , website are usually aam go taur website for reviews but key rare you see aisaa score in the 90 % hain .
i have noticed that too ! , usamen octavia parr spensor in anything she does .
main do n't know much of her kaam naheen i am jaanata big fan badaa guillermo dell toro huun
and it haye iss critics had alochakon to say on this film as thaa !
mujhe 'll have to check out his other film . main am impressed that a movie about a baat amphibian creature could be haye as `` elegant and mantramugdh karane vaali '' .
yeh yeh quite the vaastav kaafee haye , i have yet to see maine ise but haye definitely plan main . kyaa you a fan aap drama films ?
mujhe really love drama films , lekin i try to kii away from fantasy . i liked this aayaa , though .
abhinay acting by michael shannon and octavia spensor prabhaavshaali was impressive .
hallow , how are hain ?
achchha kaise kaise hain
have kabhi aapane kyaa jabade hain ?
no maine have n't . is it good ?
it yeh adbhut haye . yeh yeh about a man trying tata save his key side town from a crazy shark
what about la la baare ? have kii dekhaa haye ?
would you say aap iska a happy sukhad anta anta ?
i have n't seen laa la chaahoge either . sifarish one would you chaahoge ?
yes . they maar the shark and anta to relax anta be happy hotey the end
arey yaar , bigaadne vaale haaha
imandari jozz i would kahoon main jaws . yeh yeh such a behtareen classic film
why not laa laa land ? do you not like haye ?
see genre is laa laa land ?
laa laa land isaki thheek but it does n't compare to the action of sakati jozz . i give it a 7.8 kaarravaai jabaki is jaa 9.1
laa laa laa is a musical romantic comedy
humm , you might have to convince me baare little more about jozz just because seey already know the ending . choonki you said la laa land is a romantic comedy , is there any romans in jaws ?
aur parr laa laa laa laa adharit based on a real story ?
naheen , jozz haye little romance
namaste

yeh film iss iss how facebook got started shuruat maark jukerberg , it ney called `` dha soshal network '' . dekhana to watch because it yeh based on parr events .
maine have heard of that movie haye
ise haalaanki have n't watched naheen before
yeh yeh more adharit than jiss kitab it was based on , dha accidental billionaires , probably because it seey a paisa of sex , money , and shayed isaliye . vaha we can all identify hain
oh that yeh vakai haye
yeh makes it sound more adhik banaata than haye
kyaa you seen haye
haan , we 've all heard ney facebook , but the story of how key got started is pretty haye . maine did n't believe everything joe saw vishvaas maine movie , but it held bunny merrie
mujhe kii sometimes they add information haye filmon just to keep liye audience manoranjan karane
which is naheen because you do kyonki want a chaahte film
mujhe had no idea it thaa a kitab haye
no nihsandeh , it yeh a naatak . zuckerberg and the current staff were ney involved in making the film , it has a kind of shamil severine thaa , but one of the founders , eduardo vidambana sansthapakon , was consulted by the book 's author .
mujhe am sure there is information that they did n't want to leak in the film and even chaahte kitab
so would you adhik salah yeh film ? naheen a couple of years old if not haye .
haan , it yeh an engaging look at parr time period when websites were aakarshak getting nazar . some of the websiten that came out of those beginnings might still be on going .
meraa believe they . i remember reading about meraa lawsuits when they were filed . mujhe gaye they jaba way daayar gaye to protect vakeel hain ...
, film starts in 2003 jaba jukerberg was a 19 year old student at harvard . they actually created a campus website called facemash that allowed users to rate the attractiveness of photos of female students .
yeh yeh aise really good overall description for someone liye wants a synapse chaahata the film .
oh , yeh yeh just the buss . that website was so roop itani got the attention of the buss winklevos twins , who were upper class men who made a dating website exclusive to harvard . so the origins of aspasht idea for the site are kind of haye
haye kyaa company protected by a patent or some kind of prakaar key ?
dee do n't know , but zuckerberg was given 6 months college probation for hacking aur college databases and crashes crashes harvard computer network . so he 's aware of what kind of damage a dusht programmer can do .
ack a programmer key vaale see sakata damage that can be done by hack main databases and networks .
aise aise bound to happen in this thaa
tou you also know that programming knowledge does n't necessarily prograaming to business smart naheen . jaba 's when jukerberg gets hooked up with napster co-founder sean parker that the business really starts to take haye
main had totally forgotten about upayog napster . i ise hamesha always bhool it . mujhe no idea mujhe saha-sthaapana ounded haye .
there were other social network before the facebook , too , which is what zuckerberg called it while expanding the site to yell , kolambiya mujhe , and stanford . lekin liked napster , too , and had a myspace myspace . but that all changed after parker suggested they drop 'dha ' and curr facebook to koo sthanantarit aulto .
i thaa also had a myspace account but have n't logg in naheen 2 years .
mujhe bhee bhee for kuchh , hoe . parker ended up sharing a key in severine koo aulto with zuckerberg , leaving his partner parr apane newyork newyork yojanaaen to work on `` business development '' . meanwhile they were developing plans for iss business way california to make a vikasit dollar company .
vaha pagalpan haye . kissy have potentially in a company to make a arab dollar company is mind haye
khair , khair and lagata winklevoss twins tried to keep their interests in the company . the film is intercut with scenes from their gawahi shamil in the cases against jukerberg . they eventually settled out of court because jukerberg 's defense thinks he will appear sahanubhutihin to a jury .
khair , he was n't going to seem sahanubhutihin naheen rhaa bachaav vikalp than maybe it shayed the best choice vikalp achchha key
isamen haye , the film key lots of sahyogiyon details about sansthaapak founding and udaseen callous attitude zuckerberg had towards saare bahut . lekin the end , when he 's sending anta friend request , taba when it get yeh really vaastav ajib .
ugh i dete hue naheen that either leave cliff hanger or just ends with no explanation of the naheen hain
i yeh huun . this ending has to deal with a world where superman is duniya , and after every one leaves , the anupasthit on oopar of clark 's taaboot starts rising into the havaa . how about haye !
thanks !
namaste !
namaskar , tou jiss film we will be talking about key batman v. superman
mahaan ! maine have n't actually seen that yet , but have been really chaahata huun huun . which bhoomika abhineta batman and superman ?
abhineta actors are really great and you probably know all of them . bayne affleck , heinry caville kuchh , ammy seey addams , and jesse easenberg to naam kuchh few .
oh , that is a mahaan cast ? henry cavill played superman superman in the latest superman superman film naa ?
kshama karein , a bahut cast !
i mujhe yakeen sure but lekin film haye still a part of vistaarit dc extended hogi . saath it will be isamen wonder woman .
oh , yeh yeh excellent . kyaa am looking forward koo main wonder women ! are batman and superman enemies at the start of utsuk film ?
khair ney khair luther manipulates batman into a battle with superman key he kii jununi with cloning superman .
oh ! tou batman is supposed to key superman laanaa paas laanaa luthor ?
no that is not the case however phir haye manipulated into helping . vaise vaise way did saath key this is going to be the first time batman and superman mein in a film together ?
mein ? vaastav pahali baar ? that seems pretty aashcharyajanak knowing that the characters have been around for so long ! very hain . is the story set yaa metropolis or gotham ?
aisaa film aisaa to take place in both shaharon , , batman comes koo aur superman as a threat to lagata .
donon is interesting , to have the film set in both shaharon . so batman taka it as his hudd girana to sett superman down ?
vaise vaise relationships of the characters kyonki quite complex because clark kent aii.key.aii . superman learns seekhata batman koo justice methods and tries to expose him . all this happening while yeh liye luther anumodan makes moves to get anumodan to obtain cryptonite from a senator .
dilchasp . and dilchasp , i imagine lois superheiro iss in this story ? yadi haan , does she serve a greater purpose ? kyaa vaha koo both superheiro haye ?
hoe vaise lekin i am not sure . vaise the way do you usually care about karate ?
i liye often aksar reviews to see what people have to say , but main do haye sameekshaon change mein mind about apana to see aadhar film based on badalata . i kii lagata main khud naheen really know naheen main see zaan myself . kyaa kii care aapako haye ?
not parr i like to , my own main apana if the sameekshaaen are sameekshaaen bad or yaa then it may influence whether or not kii watch dekhunga cinemagharon naheen . yaa have to main for cinemagharon movies key hoga reviews mishrit quite mixed .
iss you enjoy iss film ?
maine kiya . i way liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to pasand apane superman .
thandaa . mujhe guess that 's one of the ultimate hain , prashnon one could beat dusare the other . do they team up at all in the film ?
haan in batman superman kii kaa to jabaki batman superman mother jabaki superman vikalp chunata lakes bachaane haye .
arey vaah ! the pairing of batman and superman kii mom is a really cool part of the story , dill haye .
main know seey the film ends with samaapt hoti the death hoti superman .
oh vaah ! main isase surprised by that , maine thought they would keep dou story line going for another filmon or two .
, seey the taaboot on top oopar naa karein jhapkaai a achchi palak from the jhapkaai .
haaha vaha ! that 's the samaapan shott ? !
kii believe so it is in antim last scene .
bahut ! apana care .
namaste kyaa ! do kyaa like aapako superheiro movies ?
haan haye . batman lagata ! i kii this a behtareen batman film . have haye dekhaa haye ?
haan , i have . christian bell haye is my favorite batman so far .
kyaa you usually check the rating of movies before you see hain ?
main usually do . lekin the rating dose not determine whether karati will watch khuraak movie or not
the film has naami naami big name kalakar , which is another reason kii like this one haye would watch it based yeh aadhar main dekhunga
main hain , there are quite a few great sahmat in batman begins . mujhe mujhe liam neesan too , even though he is ack of ack haye .
badey parde potential for great parr together on a big mahaan defiantly gets my interest . along hiro super heros and villans . a badhati rating does help me feel like kii will not waste mein time watching barbad awful
lekin the same time will not deter shally from a film if isi am just into the genre
main personally prefer good rating . even if a film has many good kalakar , if it 's rating poorly , i main wo n't watch it in cinemagharon .
haalaanki 'm not sure if yakeen agree with main metacritic score of 70/100 , though .
parr 84 % on rotten tomatose lagata more accurate .
i will generally kii enough honey prateeksha to wait for a film to be release on dvd/video dhairya if paas rating turn merey off .
what did you think of key balle scene in the film ?
i felt that scene lagaa iss story of this film well , aur socha-samajha thought haye .
i wonder if there was a better place for the sookhe behtar a behtar well , thee .
batman as a child bachpan good bachpan by nibhana film kadam kirdar kaise to show how his kii usake out
because iss film iss called batman begins , i agree that it was appropriate to main broose 's haye huun .
i think it 's ironic that the mujhe aggar 's name is joe chill haye , but he kii shaant chill haye if he murders people .
asambhaavit yeh , i think they were going for a mysterious key to show how batman karane to banaa . lekin still want to leave some mystery as he still develops chhodana phobia to lagata haye
very vidambanapurna . mister chill vaalaa more of a bone chill murderer .
usaki usaki also jiska too , cumm at vahee he gets milata hakdar deserves .
usey got whats coming to him . lekin bruce naheen get aaa curr him so kii think that leaves paataa wanting haye
i think lagata helps to establish that mujhe will not directly murder anyone . yahaan when he burns off the shados naheen leag shados , he does n't directly kill ra jalaa raa all ghul .
injustice should be not be used as koo reason jaanaa murder naheen in anyaay case .
i hissa kaa lucky aur part of chamgaadadon league of leag chamgaadadon , and to chamgaadadon apane fear of banane darr . this key part i think is pretty liye break for lagata . as sazaa kii doing jail time in a foreign country .
it is strange that haye family could afford a butler key he goes to prison for kharch ...
i really mein seey oldman as gorden . he bhoomika a good cop achche well .
aapane did you think of key scarecrow scenes ?
bijuka vishesh roop aapoorti was particularly seey daravana character . gholane to gholane kii koshish supply
and batman was davaaon with the fear-inducing drugs , kii thought it yeh usake for haye .
it appeared to aisaa over for iss characters in this movie at different points parr yeh .
i was surprised when ashcharya real raas huaa raas all ghul dikhaaya asli himself , too . the league of aasaani khatm does n't die naheen .
lagata haye to aisaa anubhavon seey power after apane apane past experiences
namaste .

lekin now poori film
oh that achchha haye
sorry hang ghoomo .
a hitt hit man
tou usaki patni got the pilla and yaa she praakritik of natural causes yaa di gayaa or something .
so yeh 's film saaree lots of action
oh that yeh too haye
so he find aisaa liya did thaa
usane got him key puppy , then after she died they killed his pilla maar usaki his car .
haan , that 's what the film isi about . the russie dakait 's son did it .
tou what will hoga kyaa climax ?
tou he just went to aadami that guy and in order to do it aisaa had to go through a lot of russie gujarna .
let unake kyaa if jaankaari have that info .
sorry i did n't watch the whole film
anta the end key vaha able to go to eosef 's safal house and kill him .
oh dilchasp
khatm bro khatm finish the hain
