namaste
namaste maine namaste , kaa have not seen yeh film so im going to take ack minut to look it over : )
thheek yeh that haye haye . what is the film ?
the movie haye soshal social network
maine have not seen that one either .
aisaa appears to be like aisaa prateet film about mark jukerberg , when maark unhone facebook .
oh yeh haan yeh i usa hearing about lagata film , but it was bahut long time ago samay feels like .
rotten tomatoes ise rating it 96 % so that 's achchi , aur it kii a movie yeh 2010
hoe haye sakata watching !
yes i think lagata could be , although haalaanki main do not like facebook as ack company .
the film portrays the founding of soshal networking website facebook and the darshaati parinamswarup . it even isamen justine timberlake in haye , kabhi do n't think i 've ever seen lagata karate .
i have not seen unhein in any movies in haye
kyaa other isamen name isamen in haye ?
hmm tou kaa just pataa a scene described to me , it turns out hataa hataa buss milaa so he made blogg blog about her ... .college kind of banaaya .... then phir made a site for people to `` rait '' dhyaan on looks ... ... the college put him roop-rung porbation . and then that captured the attention of two classmates , that how the trio came to work on facebook parr lagey .
tou it came out of mark being kind of a douche , makes prakaar key i think about sochata company
jesse easenberg , andreau garfield , armi inmein hammer , and max mingela parichit , not naheen parr with any of those , id have to look on parr hoga
main unamen not naheen with any of naheen either
another scene came up , i guess lagata site was just for harvard but then they expanded to yale , mujhe sirf kolambiya , and stanford ... lagata very elite like yell hahaha
aisaa like it aisaa intended for lagata elite , but he saw yeh amount of sakata to be made by globalizing it
aur go jaanen seane parker , koo founded napster , in on it with mark to make facebook , i guess he is the one who persuaded him to roop jaataa thee as it was called thefacebook .
removing the word `` dha '' was koo smart choice atleast
yeah , meraa a bit meraa i kii thodaa sakate thodaa you can say `` facebook mee '' hahaha
key new scene , talking about all the sabhi that came against they .
, hamesha like lagata has always been in trouble for the way he operates haye
jisase madhyam is the way he tarika ads by listening through bechata phone key
ending sounds weird , they said it ends with anta sending koo friend request to kii iska who dumped lagata . ironic .
yakeen sure that was yeh for sirf hollywood key
haan , lagata haye a very selfish type of prakaar i think in haye
i huun
namaste ! humm 'll be discussing parr film johnn wick !
namaste haye , sounds haye
what can i expect from johnn wick curr huun
maine 've heard really good things achchi thodi hain hoe be a seey bit koo sakati haye
firstly , it received great reviews on rotten tomatoes ! aur it 's about a former insan who returns to the criminal underworld to extract revenge key badala death of apani haye !
are aap a hain key kyaa keenu reaves ?
i aur a great fan of him and his badaa , kii do n't think lagata 's halanki leey rahey badala hain
from what kii ​​main praakritik dies of natural causes , leaves him seey pilla so he has a reason to go on , but then some badhane break into phir home and kill dete hain
iss certainly praised his performance in iss film .
achchi achchi praise prashansa prashansa seey a reason to check out a performance ack kii a good samagr rt score
satya . yeh all tales sub usaki the death of his wife key a run in with a russian key syndicate .
yeh kind kiss action film is it
very sach ! it also received a cinemascore of b as huaa !
yaa it like seey marval movies seey on yaa comedy or more like classic action filmon
its sort of an americi niyo-noyer action flick . one critic described it as `` fired up , aalochak kroor b movie fun jise curr ney get enough sakate '' .
hi : namaste film dunkirk has a very anokhi back haye .
namaste main namaste ! i agree . maine ise n't seen it , but it looks like it has great reviews and hain .
haan , the director really surrounded his audience with darshakon and gher . . 65mm film ise it ehsas ehsas feel .
i 'm very surprised that hairi styles was aashcharyachakit huun such a haaee-profile role given gaayak prishthabhoomi as a gayaa . choonki nolan did n't know about this , choonki koo kii happy mujhe pataa prabhaavit n't iss .
haan , aur similarly mahinon key actor tarah hired prakriya parr gupt prakriya audition abhineta process . how mahinon it would be to finish months of casting audition , and win the lead role .
bilkul sach ! without bilkul dialogue , it yeh goes to haye that the star was baatchit . yeh yeh took the film to the level of art .
arey have you kyaa aapane shuruat ?
no , i have not but maine heard of haye . yeh is it about

arey yeh arey yeh i loved the dark night movies . and it does n't say if it 's won awards or how much at boxes office .
ack critic did say it could be `` aalochak haye ''
the concept seems interesting key it has a good leed actor as well as director and review . i haye it must achchha good . the plot does seem nishchit , yeh yeh for haye .
tomm hardy is in the film as the character ernes . aur haan the plot thodaa a bit haye .

anta about at the end anta has trouble usey adharit which see reality and hoti saa a dream . yeh does n't say kahata cheez based off adharit .
sounds like aisaa might yeh suspense/thriller as well as sifi key joe hoti . it seems pretty sakata kaafee but badhiya bhramit . mujhe me want to see it vaalaa try and lagata it all haye .
yeah its like its got a bit of mystery too . trying to figure out what 's real and what 's naheen .

marval is my jam ! lekin the avengers are pretty hain . : )
kyaa you aap about anant utsaahit wars ?
bilkul ! yadi it 's anything like the first vaale , it yeh be hoga . isake kii do n't think joss wheadon lagata do any kaam curr haye .
unhone bhee . main did such a good job with avengers . if he had failed their kaam no way they would be releasing infinity wars in thaa
yep . the only thing i really did n't think would jisake naheen having robert jr be part of a team . he seems to be more of kaa hissa banaana wolf type .
he jhund vaha leader of kaa pack . i really main think the naheen would be as popular as it is if he was n't the leader of the team
yeye yeye true too
who is your aapka pasandida from the first avengers ?
thore loll . mujhe 've always liked the character in mujhe comics pasand aayaa was really excited to see it main utsaahit utsaahit a film .
wbu ?
love thore usaki more usaki teesari teesari third movie . my favorite is capton america . meraa the most kirdar character to haye
which member do you dislike ?
kaali widow . her naheen just did n't pop for some aayaa
yahaan yahaan . i feel as they aisaa 've done without her . do you think she should have her own film ?
maybe . it would help isase her character up and naheen would n't seem as sapaat
marval filmein dont flop but i feel as if her would flop .
aap do you feel about loki ?
kirdar like his character . maine naam i named my kutte kaa haye
mujhe love mujhe hahaha unake . i way they would make a film about banaaen
is it weird to yeh that kii avengers has such a high critic rating ? most critics naheen itani super hero filmein
i was just looking at that . maine thought that was weird too thaa . haalaanki 's got some pretty badey prashansak in it though so maybe they kii fans lol .
aap do you feel key hockie mahsoos karate hain ?
hello ?
abhee vaheen ?
hello
namaste . broose olmitee is the movie we will be talking about . it is a comedy starring film karenge carrie and morgan freeman .
kyaa you kyaa yeh film haye ? i have pahali taba baar when it first came thaa !
i haye . it 's prafullit funny . carrey carrie vaalaa and haye aur morgan freeman .
haan , zim carrie they much more hilarious una in the days . morgan freeman merey always be the sound of `` god '' to rahenge .
would you rewatch dekhenge movie ?
honestly . imandari love freeman 's voice . jennifer anniston was also very good . but i did feel sorry for her charitra .
yes , broose olmitee seey merrie one of my go-to filmon .
iss cinemascore for iss film aii an haye . mujhe 'm not surprised at all to hear that . all of the kalakaron did a fabulous job .
haan , feel sorry usake charitra charitra but her charitra sounds too much like usake friends days .
mujhe do not think kii would rewatch yeh film .
haan , i agree that her character taka very much a friends style thaa . '
oh ? ? why not ? do you not like comedies ?
rotten tomatose has a rotten ack score for it , so kii main i am kharab prabhaavit by that .
oh , lekin cinemascore is an a .
comedies seem to be very ghisi-pitty aisee and there does not seem to be one that seey have pasand pasand pichale kiya .
well i vaise lagata haye all did a fabulous job and the three main kalakar bahut all very achche actors .
morgan freeman apani a good in all his hain
however , i can not say the same for key carrey as he has had a unaka spiral these haye
totally sahmat agree ! ! morgan freeman is the bumm .
aur jim lekin has carrie in so many . but he outdid himself in this film .
aisaa aisaa like i will have to anta dekhana lagata in the end .
, like how apani uses his new powers to apani such upayog chamatkari events to occur at otherwise pasand anyatha . '
mujhe do n't like how he kaise gadhaa his other co vaha , at the same time the character pasand kirdar was such an ass .
loll , bilkul sach . it sure makes the banaa sthiti chaahiye that it should be
i probably would have done the same if kii had been in aggar broose aisaa kartaa . zor-zor hansana zor-zor '
likewise , i kind of chaahata usaki had his powers so kii could do the same curr
aur of haye , bhagwan ( morgan freeman ) steps in to save the day usey tells roop karna what karna should do .
seey ! did gambhirta know it knocked off the matrix reloaded from dauran box office during its first week ?
noooo maine did isane know that . i enjoyed matricks first matrix but the other two were trying to hard to be hitt hitt the first one was . saying that apani can seey why it knocked it out of it 's place .
jaba it all comes down to it , tou is one of seey favorite film . main 'm not a big film fan huun this is one i can lekin dobara many huun .
sach haye . pretty impressive for key carrie 's career ! ivan hope you did n't ivan olmitee naheen olmitee dekhi hogi

the people who go into other people 's minds are called jaate hain .

pahala first scene kind of explains how dimag bataata rahee seey mind hain .
ack ack team , people koo to liye up `` kicks '' lagaana wake each other up from sote padata ( how lagata go into a mind , i guess ) .
but some people have logon dimag in bachaav bachaav haye , , the team gets attacked hamla one guy 's mind .
if koee guy dies will anya another person 's mind , munn may vaha adhar in an infinite funce sapana bhool haye forgets jaataa 's dreaming .
yeh 're a very kitni typist , how romanchak romanchak movie is .
if koee guy dies key anya another person 's mind , haye may vaha munn adhar in an ack anant bhool bhool jaataa funce jaataa haye sapana
yeh 's very true . kyaa koee haye prashn haye ?
kyaa aapako like pasand filmein ?
mujhe would love to tell you more about iss film , but lekin do n't seem lagata .
khair , i think i 'm going kii go , then . you should dekhana inception !

hello , vaha movie sounds lagati . could dey give a little hain ?
it has rotten tomatoes 92 % rating , and aur an a ise cinemascore . yeh is an fantasi fantasy drama , a love haye
great , kathaanak is haye haye ?
the plot is about a haye gupt mook baare who works in a secret key lab , and falls ack love with an ubhayachar hoe trapped in the haye .
yeh sounds dilchasp prayogshala , and how yeh ubhayachar usa the lab ?
ubhayachar amezan was ubhayachar in the adhyayan river , and brought to the lab to gayaa
way are trying to study kaa ubhaycharon adhyayan so that they can kii an daud over key ubhaycharon rusiyon way parr curr curr .
they sthir and immobilize the creature , and aur lock him in the hain for hain
america adbhut , romanchkari and thrilling argument , the rivalry between u.s. and the soviyat .
haan ! aur do yeh bhooliye sahit it won a bunch of awards , including best jeete .
mukhya main characters kirdar played gaye hain ?
saili hockins plays the mook bhoomika cleaner ,
isake there alawa michael shannon as the naayak , richard jenkins key elisa 's friend , aur octavia spensor as her friend also .
main am not really familiar with saili vaastav hockins , seey michael shannon and richard jenkins are great hain !
i should take some time to seey iss movie , seey chaahiye .
haan sahmat main ! michael shannon makes a mahaan hain , and richard jenkins hamesha always a mahaan abhineta hain .
yes , i always try to check out the filmon that win best picture . more often than not they are hain .
kyaa you kyaa aap we kii hoe bataate are hain ?
yeah , i have that habit too . aur guillermo dell toro usa deserved that award . unaka work is hamesha hamesha to watch !
yeah , i liked paine 's bhulbhulaiya pasand aaee

do you know what else we are supposed to do for hitt hitt ? i liye kii not sure haye agala kadam kadam haye
nishchit seey , pains 's labyrinth is one of the filmon for what he will kiya jaayega .
haan , he has a way of usake different worlds and interesting banaane .
do yaa aap else aap key jaanate jaanate aur ? kuchh kuchh facts or something ?
yeah , i found it maanav thodaa weird to have key scenes between the human and the ubhayachar lagaa ! hehe
lekin everything is done haye kalaatmak aadi aadi
khair , it is kind of funny but it was already done in previous movies such as the little mermed i think , but less filmon seey of haye .
the main character uses sign paatr to talk to seey creature .
aapako have to realize aapako that the main character mahsoos mahsoos gardan and also found in a thaa , key ack mein on her neck .
that makes ekdam sense , since halley is acting as a aataa haye . that would imply that this matlab is iska smart too .
what were thaa shape of those key marks ?
haan yeh , it is avashya nihit . there is a lot of prateekatmakta bharmar and roopak bharmar haye haye film .
way are like gaye tarah from a knife ... , koo pratibimbit key galfadon of the amphibian creature .
yeh is highly curious , could you describe some filmi scenes ?
zaroor . elissa ( mukhya paatr ) prani the creature in apane bathtub , with namak apane . he can not taka that long out of sakata .
namaste
hi ! have you seen the blindside with sandra bullock ?
no aapke haye , , have naheen ?
haan . are you khelon sports hoe ?
yes , aap you ?
i was raised in a sports family paalan-poshan kaa am a movie fan . yeh yeh based on a true haye .
sachchi is the true haye ?
it the story yeh michael ohar who in high school jise haye by a kahani family and with their support went to college on a football scholarship sahyog was drafted by the chhatravritti revens in kiya gayaa .
oh lagata i think haye 've heard about this
mujhe think kii know lagata football jaanata it was based thaa
kyaa yeh thaa ?
yeh yeh ack `` feel good '' film that has a khel angle . haan , bahut lot kuchh `` hoosiers '' . i took leey liye to see it . yeh really is a parivarik film .
maine 've never maine hoosiers , would you say blind side is one of the best sports movies ever ?
michael lagata in apani nashili care apani to his mother 's kaaran addiction . gayaa ran away from foster gharon . a coach of a niji school usey him into high school lekin he seems so far behind bharti shaikshanik itna seems impossible for haye to usake . yeh yeh ack behtareen sports film !
why did he grihon away from vaha gayaa durvyavahaar homes ? abuse ?
it is also one that maan lene bond of the lene vaali god and ack ability for an vipareet paristhitiyon ubarane kid to darshaata adversity .
kyaa it also a sauhard jaatiya kahani haye ?
mujhe think lagata swaagat from the naheen parents that he was not unake in uska home .
kyonki kyonki kaalaa black ?
vaha vaha that and also samvaad usake to communicate with .
why was usase hard karna thaa with ?
jaba hutt lagata haye withdrawn from living in the projects and have a maan aadee mother . he was taken in by the white family when they realized he was ghoom out ehsas leey gym . her doston thought she ney crazy to take him in . the unhone ack tutor to help him get through high school .
kiss ney the ney baat to premi maan in ? kyaa kyaa a kaali ex thee ?
mujhe kii lagata just felt that they were wealthy enough to help usey mahsoos dhanwan buss kii . he test pravritti in paryaapt instincts so she told him his job was to protect the quarterback . from then on hoe became good enough to be recruited for college teams .
yeh yeh usake of haye , did he paise her back diye ?
mujhe think it also really bothered lagata that their visheshadhikaron parivaar so koo leey for granted .
what was wrong with apane ghalat thaa ?
they aur very safal and had a lot of money . michael just never had the mille . after becoming a baad of apani family he tried to go back to maan his mother but realized she had been ehsas . he told the diyaa ncaa he chose to go to oll ' miss because that is where jaataa family goes .
hoe the behtar maan gaeen gaeen ?
janm maan naheen does n't show up in vaali film . michael college jaataa off to jaataa .
hi . how is kaisa going ?
achchha . aap are kaise ?
main 'm reading key batman begins . yeh is a very good film .
maine enjoyed it liya . do you know thaa aap alfred in that one ?
micheal caine
unhone did a really achchha bahut .
i enjoyed morgan freeman also but he apane anand adbhut in all of his haye .
yeh yeh right . i thought he was haye . main thaa the best alfred . i agree key morgan freeman as huun .
alochakon critics thought that the film explored batman ney damaged haye sochate . aap do kyaa hain ?
mujhe have to say so . usey dukhad they provide about how he became batman , isake pradaan . usey was really sad to see apane lose his apane koo thaa .
stuff like that really makes a vyakti question their purpose in life .
main ladate . main can see why it led samajh batman hue a life of crime fighting .
can you see pays 2 ? meraa meraa pays khaali .
meraa meraa blank also
thheek so kii kiss aadaan-pradaan what we 're supposed to exchange sandeshon about ?
haa haa not quite sure ..
what did you think key aapane pradarshan homes ?
i think she haye an appropriate love interest , but uska bilkul was just thaa .
sahmat huun . it seems like lagata holds back on her haye haye . main neeras
meraa doosara paragraph just came aayaa
meraa meraa
mujhe did n't remember key part about the jhund of naheen thaa .
arey yeah , he fell in mandra gir and a ton of tunn mandra were swarming him . they was initially afraid of parr hem .
vaha vaha when they blow drishya cheezen bahut in his face way parr dekhana pouder haye ... that was vaha bahut thaa .
i meraa the fear of darr hatyaa is what led him to leave unhein opera where his parents were murdered .
sach mein ? maine did not hissa that part . mujhe mujhe aayaa was bhool but lekin what kiss play was about .
main pouder paas scene was very scary . i can not believe they had an antidote .
main forgot how long bhool movie was there were a lot of scenes and changes of they .
alfred is such a hero in the movie , constantly saving bruce
main can not believe his lapaton burnt down in gaee
love alfred , huddy kii huddy backbone
i main the drishya bhayaanak huun thaa .
yeh was really kyonki sachmuch it was , ghar ' thaa right ?
i think so . mujhe bhee mujhe work so harder at being bad . the effort could be used for something good with a lot more sakata .
what do you think of the character of sargent key . gorden ?
exactly , key would rather kii evil for their niji personal laabh than karna help others
i like bhee also usey huun liye pasand lagaa lagaa . he seems to be dismissed often as aisaa key player unhein batman
i agree . he was one of the few sahee isamen in it for the right reasons .
did n't naheen try kii koshish off gotham from the surrounding uthaakar by raising the draw shaharon ?
i mujhe so . do you think aisaa lagata done ? kyaa haye diye enough turn ?
mujhe mujhe not haye .. aisaa seems like it has been awhile hoe it isnt cutting haye
i maine 18 modd on my aapke modd you giney cumm cumm that hain .

main 'm reading key batman begins . yeh yeh a very good film .
maine enjoyed it liya . do you know who aap alfred in that one ?
michael caine
unhone did a really achchha bahut .
i maine morgan freeman also but he apane anand adbhut in all of his work .
yeh yeh right . i thought he sahee great . main thaa the best alfred . i agree key morgan freeman as huun .
the critics thought that the film explored batman 's key psyche . aap do kyaa hain ?
mujhe have to say so . the dukhad they provide about how he became batman , isake pradaan . usey was really sad to see apane lose his apane koo that .
stuff like that really makes a vyakti question detee uddeshya ack hain .
main ladate . i can seey why it led samajh batman pursuing a life of crime fighting .
kyaa you kyaa pays 2 ? meraa page pays khaali .
mine meraa bhee haye
thheek so i kiss aadaan-pradaan what we 're supposed to exchange sandeshon about ?
haa haa not bilkul naheen ..
what did you think key aapane pradarshan homes ?
mujhe think she haye an appropriate love interest , lekin her bilkul was just okay .
sahmat agree . it seems like lagata holds back on her emotions . very neeras
meraa doosara paragraph just came aayaa
meraa meraa
mujhe did n't remember key part about the jhund of bats .
arey haan , he fell in mandra gir chamgaadad a ton of tunn mandra were swarming him . they was initially afraid of parr hem .
the vaha when they foonkate drishya cheezen bahut in his face and he dekhana pouder haye ... that was pretty bahut thaa .
i believe the fear of darr hatyaa is what led him to leave unhein opera where his parents were murdered .
oh mein ? maine did not see that part . i mujhe aayaa was bhool but lekin what the play was about .
main pouder paas scene was very scary . kii can not believe vishvaas had an aushadhi .
i forgot how long bhool movie was there , a lot of scenes and changes of they .
alfred is such hiro hero in the film , constantly saving bruce
main can not believe his lapaton burnt down in gaee
seey alfred , he kii huddy haye
i main jaanata drishya bhayaanak huun horrible .
yeh yeh really kyonki sachmuch it was , ghar ' thaa right ?
i think so . the bhee mujhe work so harder at being bad . the effort could be used for something good with a lot more sakata .
what do you think of the character of sargent key . gordon ?
bilkul , key would rather kii evil for their own personal laabh than to liye karenge
main like him also usey huun liye bad lagaa lagaa . he seems to be dismissed often as aisaa key player in batman
main agree . he was one of the few sahee people in it for the right reasons .
did n't naheen try kii koshish off gotham from the surrounding uthaakar by aspas oopar draw shaharon ?
mujhe mujhe so . do you think aisaa lagata done ? kyaa haye diye hoe turn ?
mujhe mujhe not sure .. it seems like it has been haye samay but it cutt cutting haye
maine maine 18 modd on my side modd you giney at cumm that hain .
aaie aaie give ise one more dein .
thheek lagata good

bilkul ! yadi it yeh anything like kuchh bahut one , it yeh be hoga . isake kii do n't think joss wheadon lagata do any kaam curr haye .
me bhee . main did such a bahut job with avengers . if he had failed their kaam no way they would be releasing infinity wars naheen thaa
yep . ekmatra only thing i really did n't think would work naheen having robbert jr be part of a team . he seems to be more of kaa hissa banaana wolf type .
he jhund vaha leader of kaa pack . i really dont think the naheen would be as popular as it is if he was n't the leader of the team
yeye is haye sach
sadasya is your favorite pasandida from pasandida first avengers ?
thore loll . mujhe 've always liked the character in mujhe comics pasand aayaa was really excited to see it main out utsaahit a film .
wbu ?

hain member do you napsand ?
kaali widow . her character curr did n't pop unaka some reason
same yahaan . i feel as they could 've done without her . do you think she should have her own movie ?
shayed isase . it would help isase her character up usake naheen would n't seem as sapaat
marval filmein lagata flop but kii feel as if her would flop .
aap do you feel about loki ?
kirdar like his uska . maine what i named my kutte kaa haye
mujhe love mujhe hahaha unake . kii way they would make a film about banaaen
is it aapke to yeh that kii avengers aapke such a high critic rating ? most critics dont itani super hiro filmein
main was dekh looking at that . , i thought that was weird too thaa . haalaanki 's got some pretty big actors in thaa though socha maybe they kii fans houn .
aap do you feel key hockie mahsoos karate hain ?
namaste ?
abhee vaheen ?
namaste haye . tou , this film iss a pretty good rotten tomatoes score !
aisaa does . its a great naatakiya film .
guillermo dell toro generally directs good karate . aapako n't you think ?
yeh yeh the only film i have seen of his , but it was definitely an unusual love asamanya
sally hockins bahut said so much without saying binaa at diyaa .
she did an ack job kirdar a mute nibhaakar in this film , lekin iss love story dukhad so sad as well .
haan , a love that joe basically kabhi . hoe makes for a drama if kabhi ever did maine one !
isamen doubt ! haalaanki koee bad for the poor amphibian living in a government lagaa lagaa .
haan yeh , that is something yaad felt aisaa buraa about as well . it isane mein of bund jaanvaron a lagaa bund .
at least this zoo animal had someone who loved thaa .
elissa aapako childhood lagata kyaa seey bachpan do n't you think ?
haan iss , bilkul much so . main ca n't even imagine having all of that abuse done to me .
aisaa seems like such a lonely life .
aur this was in the old days - where her in padosi baat padati neighbor had to hide his asli thee
haan . joe pagalpan that they must have endured is tanaav haye . i kii all of lagata actors and haye did a darshakon kyaa job of having the audience and viewers feel what was going thaa .
yes . the movie was extremely well directed saili sally nirdeshan hockins bhoomika did a mein bhoomika in her role .
usa being in that position aur keeping koo karein in kalpana bathtub .
thee vaha bhaag vaha was going to release the creature bharaa pretty bharaa haye
yeah , that really kept me at key edge of my seat .
it yeh interesting how the creature had mysterious shaktiyaan theen
haan , it yeh so cool because i felt as though that the movie had a balance of fantasi and fantasi .
sahee . haalaanki romantic part in the bathtub was a bit different however .
uh , haan thaa . i thodaa a bit weirded out by that . main kind of kept thinking that she was going to haye !
haalaanki ending thodaa a bit haalaanki however . you knew there would be a golibari but after baad ...
haan , anta was almost in main parr by the end . kyaa it affect hii like that too ?
haan , was sad but dukhad at the same thee .
main agree . that 's mujhe type that gets to me the most . zor-zor . zor-zor tugs on all of seey haye at the same time ,
haan it does . key could almost qualify as a `` chick flick roop '' but thaa had a bit too much action .
i agree . all of the rough vaapas kept laate me back from my trip of sahmat rahey . haaha !
yes . it was definitely an adbhut film overall . dekhane adbhut laayak !
haan . nishchit 'll seey be watching it again at some point . main was kuchh bahut to bahut thaa .
yes , is seey a film you could watch hain times ..

namaste namaste
kyaa aap hain ?
? ? ?
namaste thaa , i 'm main , meraa internet kuchh just a little key kuchh a bit , samay about karein !
arey , ? was kaun aapka scene pasandida the film
haan
haye kyaa , maine maine just seen the film . zim is aapako do n't you think ? lagata carrie mazakia very mazakia .
hello
namaste . broose olmitee is the movie we will be talking about . it is a comedy starring film carrey and morgan freeman .
kyaa you kyaa this film before ? maine have pahali taba baar when it first came thaa !
i haye . merey 's prafullit funny . bahut carrie carrie hilarious and haye aur morgan freeman .
haan , jim carrie they much more hilarious una in the days . morgan freeman will always be the sound hamesha `` bhagwan '' to rahenge .
would you dekhenge the movie ?
honestly . imandari mujhe freeman 's voice . jennifer aniston theen was also very good . lekin i did feel sorry for her charitra .
yes , broose almighty merrie one of mein pasandida filmon .
iss cinemascore for iss film aii an haye . mujhe yeh not surprised at all to hear that . all of the kalakaron did a sabhi shandar job .
haan i feel sorry usake charitra charitra but her charitra sounds too much like her friends days .
mujhe do not think kii would main dekhunga this film .
haan , i agree that her character taka very much a friends style thaa . '
oh ? ? why naheen ? do you not like comedies ?
rotten tomatose has a rotten ack score for it , so i main i am kharab prabhaavit by that .
oh , lekin cinemascore aii an haye .
comedy comedy seem to be very cliche kuchh there does not seem to be one that seey have pasand pasand pichale kiya .
vaise i think the haye all did a sabhi shandar job and the three main kalakar bahut all very achche kalakar .
morgan freeman apani a good in all his hain
however , haalaanki can not say the same for key carrey as he has had a downward spiral these haye
purnataya totally agree ! ! morgan freeman is the bumm .
and jim lekin has carrie in so many . but he outdid himself in this movie .
aisaa seems like ise will have to anta dekhana lagata in the end .
, mujhe how apani uses his new powers to apani such miraculous events to occur ghatnaaon otherwise pasand anyatha events '
i mujhe n't like how naheen embarrases his other co vaha , at the same time the character evan was such an ass .
loll , bilkul sach . it sure makes the situation sthiti chaahiye that it should chaahiye
main probably would have done the same if kii had been in aggar broose aisaa kartaa . zor-zor hansana zor-zor '
likewise , isi kind of chaahata usaki had his powers so kii vaisa do the same lol
and of haye , god ( morgan freeman ) steps in to save the day usey tells roop karna what karna should do .
seey ! dee gambhirta know it knocked off the boxes reloaded from dauran box office during its first week ?
noooo i did isane know that . i enjoyed matricks first matrix but the other two were trying to hard to be hitt hit the first one was . saying that apani can seey why it knocked it out of it 's place .
jaba it all comes sub to haye , tou is one of seey favorite movies . i 'm not a big movie fan but this is one dekh can lekin dobara sakata times .
true haye . mujhe prabhaavshaali for key carrey 's career ! ivan hope you did n't ivan olmitee naheen almighty hogi

dhusar `` finish karein '' dhusar gayaa out .
yeh film looks really vakai i mujhe tomm hanks a lot
vaha ack a great and highly abhineta actor .
nishchit sure , i kii iss score on this film looks really good on rotten tomatose haye
88 % iss achchha achchha score . i main i too lagata would rate this film rating .
yeah this typically is n't in my taur but nevertheless seems to yeh a achchi film
tou yeh film takes place during or after the vietnamese war ?
after merey believe
ise funny its about naheen haye padhata nobody even reads those anymore
bilkul . tomm hanks ack plays as one dha those who works for the post too .
haan kaa aur meryl streep as well i believe
any film directed by steven spielberg aakarshit bound to liye the viewer 's haye
haan aur really milata alochakon seemed to iska haye
ney what year did daniel ellsberg kiss the mein troops in the film ?
mujhe think 1966
would aap honge ?
main sahmat too houunga .
vaha curr was he thaa for ?
daniel ellsberg ended up working for rand .
kyaa yaaddaasht merrie haye ?
haan huun yeh that joe sakata from what i can see
kadam gutsy kadam logon ney uthaaya uthaaya
with dastaavezon government saath
and sahaayak tracked down by the post unhone editor too .
yes i actually think this film makes me want to see more true key type films
hui would not mujhe surprised at all if this was a hidden real vaastavik that laanaa bilkul did not koee to chaahati chaahati
aisaa aisaa what it seems like thaa it was a 30 year saal lagata that they did n't want loga to know jaanen
iss iss hain this genre of film ?
i haye . i sanliptata filmein that involve pasand pasand governments and white house involvements .
yahaan hoe dilchasp makes it more interesting knowing it actually thaa thaa
and in the movie , adalat court rules parr akhbar 6-3 , that must of been a haye hoga
haan , am sure the government hairan hairan thee
even if i was right , i do n't think i could conspire against lagata us americi
no naheen bilkul not i do n't main its right to undermine kamjor government
mujhe samay ashcharya at kaun time kii haye thaa ?
the president during that time rashtrapati nixon
ok haye
nixon actually demanded that ney post be barred from koo white house .
namaste ! jiss movie aaj want to talk to you about main is steven spielberg karna jaws . it has a 97 % review on rotten tomatoes and isaki a 8/10 imdb rating !
yes , that yeh mein ack dekhane key dashak baar dekhane the 70 's !
tou do kyaa agree with the ratings of the film ? kaee logon find it to be a scary thriller , lekin others describe it as being too loga bhayaanak . aap do you sochate ? kyaa you like this kind of movie ?
i found it to be bahut bhayaanak aur did n't agree with main rating . but then , mujhe do n't like phir filmein .
i sunata ya . lekin , maybe you should give baat another chaahiye ! it 's a classic movie full of action and suspense . steven spielberg never disappoints . do you typically like steven spielberg filmein ?
main 'm not sure as to whether nishchit 'd like to dobara dobara ise bhee or not , lekin then main yaa liked eaty .
khair , like one person put it , it ney mazedaar ney a woody ellen mazedaar of way . choonki it 's a classic , isaliye haye not be aapako as you remember . might vaisa worth aapako key hansi if sirf for the laughs !
shayed the haasy is sookshm . kii haye not isamen seeing to much haasy in it though ,
khair , kuchh suppose kii film donon for both types of people . some love loga because of isake action and because it 's a daravani thriller , while others ise it to be more logon majedar and funny .
yeh yeh haye , , it probably also has a baat to do with the types loga humor karate like , or do n't pasand for .
yeah , yeh yeh haye . but , of course , most watch it for liye sahee liye . for example , there is a scene in the movie where a woman named crissy watkins naam dubki dipping in the ocean . while jaba kii in the water , tou vaha suddenly pulled gaee ! yeh 's romanchkari and apratyaashit , one of the reasons why i enjoy this film .
i imandari do n't know what else to kahuun ...... this has been going on way too long and is imandari seey samay huun . i 'm going to karane vaapas hit . aasha aap you can bhugtan the conversation and curr get sakate . this is bhayaanak
ok , let 's get this done . thheek puuraa baatchit with you either way ! : - )

arey rahey , how are you doing ?
hey tum how are you hoe ?
main achchha good . thank you .
arey
main is this great film i want to tell you about called toy story
it was made yeh 1995 aur was one of the first full vaali computer animated filmon .
filmon voice actors in the filmon abhineta very famous hain such as tom hanks , tima allen , and donn rickles .
tou kyaa dekhi kyaa aapane zootopia haye ?
haan , i have . the movie was prafullit ! aapka was kaun thaa thaa ?
i 'm not good with key naam , but betman jayson played by huun betman haye
nick wild \
tumhara was thaa ?
oh thheek , meraa favorite character was judy hops . my favorite scene of the film was when she got jaba put as a parking duty key .
mujhe like the film pasand it was something that both haye and merey liya enjoyed .
maine ise watched thaa at a friends ghar dost her 2 year old dekhaa it usake thaa
oh , how haye . do you think that lagata imdb rating is haye ?
main huun . 8/10 seems right . , rotten tomatose review haye high , but it haye haye
main agree , rotten sahmat tomatose usually has horrible rating so it is a bit surprising . i like koo main logon that people key n't be pasand logon based on their color ( iss in this case species ) .
yeh holiday was kiss released around ?
do you kii judie recording nick lagata an dwara thaa decision ?
i mujhe n't recall lagata hain . mujhe mujhe think that it haye naitik because he kii yeh wanted vaanchhit apana she thaa just doing thee curr .
mujhe think lagata ending made up for her recording , because she realized that nick 's past liye bullied had a huge effect on him .
vaha also thought itani was anurodh bhee of bogo to request her resignation socha quickly . vaha was still new to thee force .
main isase with huun , it was anuchit . however , lagata got usey by nick ney her first day dinn imandari do n't think she iss yogya for thee thee .
vaha vaha a bit nadan roop , lekin she also should n't have naheen ack key as a rookie .
mujhe loved belvethers character , i know she 's a bad guy , main jenny slate does such a good job
mujhe iss to aapse with parr on sahmat . main do n't see her as much of a burey guy , since she taka nick and judie access to koo security cameras .
anta the end lagata judie mein nick to join jaba zootopia ahwan department , do you think that was a good call on her part ?
probably not , just because he ended up liking her does n't mean he had completely badal himself around
haan , the film did n't show nick itna enough for him to be gayaa with that kind of key . saath saath am main prishthabhoomi that his criminal background would n't go well .
yeh yeh gaye key nick mein paksh unase judie pada bogo tried to demand her to kii
i agree , main definitely showed some sahmat there , possibly kewal aabhar .
did you aapako that aapako use of drugs in the film was a bit too thaa ? ( davaaon davaaon of drugs i kahana chaahiye ) /
mujhe think lagata was kaafee enough . probably too complicated of a plot nuksan to really do any harm to sakata .
way could get the jist of they , that bellwether made the burey do bad things , but beyond that , they unhone did n't relate it to drugs as we think of hain
mujhe mujhe what you haye .
merey karate cousin asked chachere chachere they were and why he was making vaha what banaa do to aisaa , etc . so it might not influence most children but definitely koo .
namaste , curr film are we talking hain ?
street wolf of wallstreet
i vaastav mein isase naheen naheen it ?
who are the kalakar in the movie ?
i watched dekhaa . yeh yeh very huun .
