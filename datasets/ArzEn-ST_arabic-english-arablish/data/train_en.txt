it had a great impact on me
and it was about jerusalem before persaders invaded it.
and it was describing the the feelings of fear anxiety
all these things before knowing that other people would invade their country.
and this is their feelings.
and everyone was talking and there was a philosopher that was answering them back.
in this book?
if i correctly remember there was something called be proud of your scars that's it.
nobody
gym
i was in mun and i'm older than you before it was called sife now it's called enactus.
these are the two main activities that i was enrolled in model of united nations and what we call now enactus.
i was i was a secretary in the security council and basically a model of united nations.
they were events to mimic the events of united nations among which security council.

no
no
i don't know
i would like to work as a researcher rather than a teacher actually.
did you do internships before at college ..
i was in mun
in ibm
and .. and it was nice
and there was another training in siemens.
it was nice as well but still i find myself more in my career.
yes, i can say something like that
no, my life when i was a student at college
because i mean it was balanced.
it was level of freedom versus level of responsibility but not like now.
currently level of responsibility is much higher.
so there is no the same flexibility in time as before.
i want to return back as a student.
yes.
i have been to finland, turkey and german.
i have to say the last trip which was german because i had worked well there and actually it was very fruitful.
yes, i have to say yes.
yes, we are still in contact.
research stay related to phd
my phd is related usable security.
basically usable security means to have system that is both usable in terms of being convenient to the user the user should know how to use it and yet to be secured so as not to be vulnerable to different sorts of attacks.
so basically we're analyzing the different ways of attacks and we're trying now to figure out usable way to secure the the mobile systems.
yes, paris.
i have no idea but i feel that many people went there they had an experience so i can go there.
no, i would immigrate.
if it wasn't german then it would be emirates.
in german i have contacts in these countries if i traveled actually i'm determined that i will travel, work and know exactly what i want to do.
but in emirates i have besides having already many friends actually, it is a promising market.
i went to dahab.
this is the fifth or sixth time that i have been to dahab.

i like the country very much.
we haven't any activities actually in the last trip but definitely we went to blue balls three pools.
everything in dahab actually
no
i mean my life sequence is not moving in this way.
definitely life is not moving smoothly
but i think definitely everybody can face problems at work.
but i mean for example i faced a problem at my master's time.
but that didn't hinder me from doing it.
afterwards i discovered that it was something very strong.
but the problem that occurred to me at that time was a big one and thanks god i overcame it actually.
no individual
i'm in control of every aspect of the work so that’s why i think that it is better to work on my self on my own.
no, but is there a role model in certain field?
i mean everyone i see is a role model in certain field
can you mention examples if there certain thing that you want to say.
i mean so the so so in my life for example on the personal level i believe that my mother is a great person.
at work i see that professor slim for example he's a very good teacher actually
i mean i learn something from everybody.
respected
i consider myself an easy person to deal with but you have to ask other people about it actually.
no, at all
i have no problem at all in this issue.
no, i deal normally.
i don't feel that there is any problem actually
sycophants
yes there is a term that i won't mention, those people who want to impress their boss or or so so they kept flattering him.

do you know urgent and important distribution?
it is that if the task is urgent and important it's the first thing to be done.
urgent but not important it's the second thing that should be done and so forth.
to hide that i don't understand
yes, it happened.
no i mean, i mean what was the reaction?
no, i think it passed that's it.
no
no
because everything is there.
everything i need is there.
i need it for communication with others i mean
that's it?
okay
okay i used to live in fayoum till the first secondary then i moved to cairo because i was practicing in el bank al ahly club and .. %k swimming actually.
when i'm done there and i get to know my friends and other people and groups and so on and i get to know that there is a university called guc.
whatever my total grade was i mean i enrolled here.
whatever my total grade was i mean i enrolled here in the university.
in the beginning i wanted to joined mechatronics
and then i joined met
currently i'm more interested in web development
and i try to search for new interests.
okay, i selected the major i mean i was thinking at first about mechatronics.
i found that in met as well frankly many of my friends enrolled there and i know others who graduated.
they took the bachelor and did the masters abroad or in egypt so i liked the idea actually.
and i felt that they are in so .. i can join more than field in met.
not .. it doesn't have great reputation
met is different i mean
my bachelor is a verification of the online images.
it's supposed that i received online use and i have to make sure of the source whether it's right or not.
i check the photos whether they're correct or not, photoshopped, faked, ((corrupted)) by any means of new editors or any software applied on the image i can detect it.
to use several programming language not only one which is the only benefit in the bachelor.
i don't have a fixed routine.
i don't have something in particular to do everyday.
i can get up at seven in general i don't sleep much so i can get up .. usually i get up at five because of college and to catch the bus and so on actually so i get used to do that.
i can tell you the routine that i'm getting used to.
i was getting up, go to the exercise, return back to have breakfast.
if i have classes at college i would practice at college.
and then i continue the day at college and stayed there till six or seven something like that.
then i returned back by bus and since i live far away, i live in shoubra so it takes time so i returned back home at eight o'clock for example.
i just eat and watch anything on the internet on facebook, youtube anything and then i go to sleep.
on the  weekend most of my weekend i spend in club or .. in club or in exercise or meeting my friends or something like that but i don't travel thank god.
besides i'm getting used to swim all time but actually i don't consider this a hobby it's more a sport.
i read a lot.
and i like learning many languages as well.
there is more than one book but i can mention the most recent one.
a book called the flinch
for james something i don't remember actually james what?
it's about the flinch when you're worried when you're about any trial to worry for example about jumping from the plane or doing anything this is called flinch it means that you're hesitated.
so how do you overcome it and how do you go on in anything or try anything and not to keep waiting, something like that.
i liked it because it shows that you shouldn't wait something in specific to start working, that's it.
okay since i enrolled in college i joined two clubs.
club enactus
in the club generally we are working on projects, not logistics, or hr or something of that sort certain projects we're in charge of a project.
i was working on a project called furny cards.
we used to deal with a big company related to decorations and so.
they used to send us designs and we do  furniture by using cards.
car boards
and we know how to sell it and we used uneducated or physically disabled or mentally to do the cards or to make furniture and to sell it so as to be a profit for them.
i was in another club as well but it was race cars.
he was in charge of organizing events
and there are events that are being held here in the settlement.
we were responsible of organizing the events i join as an usher in most of the university activities.
this is most of the activities i do at college actually.
i tried both working individually of course has benefits and team work has benefits but %k .. i mean on the long run of course it has to be team work.
working individually you can reach to a point and then give up everything and you don't want to go on on anything so you quit.
no team works they encourage each others
they learn more from the mistakes you feel that you learn
working individually there is no one to revise after you so you feel that you're sleeping actually.
most of the time english but it can be arabic i like it i mean arabic that is little lebanon dialect or little far away than the egyptian culture actually.
or the old movies that we get used to watch long time ago but now i'm not following.
i mean english or arabic?
anything?
the most singer
it can be eminem
sometimes i was much listening to her because i like to enthusiasm myself during the training so i actually get used to that long time ago.
okay who else do i listen to my oh god? i listen to fayrouz so much.
about school no i don't think that i will enroll them in a national school because i was in a national school and there is no benefits.
and then i saw people from international schools and i liked their way of thinking.
it can be a german school.
pardon me what is the question once more?
what are you going to teach them when they start speak? which words would you teach them? and in which language?
i will slightly go far away from the issue of teaching them words in a specific language besides the language you are using because it's the language they will first use. i mean later on they can understand second languages.
so most of things are in arabic i don't think so i mean when we get far away from this topic we will not force you actually.
and that's it once they started to understand the languages they can understand more the meaning of the words and we can teach them the words in another language and the language that is not being used at home or the language that he can use at school or somewhere else.
what i really want to do, i don't want to be an employee or i mean by income or to work in certain company and to take income per month sorry salary monthly and i mean currently i'm searching for being an entrepreneur.
i took a courses in entrepreneurship so as to know how to make start-up how to make it abroad or in country because i'm not sure about my status  of course.
but this is the point but my dream job it's no it's my dream company for example my dream organization more than dream job.
which field?  at first i was thinking of web development because i took an experience from the internship and i took courses and so on.
but lately i mean i didn't find this topic ..
it was not my great interest
so currently, i search and ask as well the major i enrolled in .. i enrolled in because of several factors  it has several ways to learn several fields not only web development.
the reason of my bachelor i enrolled in a field that's totally different image processing to see the .. as well the work field how would it be like.
but now there is a stage that i'm searching actually.
i worked as a part-time for a while in the company i did before internship i did internship for three months.
and the manager slightly liked my work and the supervisor so he proposed part-time job so i thought of trying it.
part-time job is the same as the internship it was the same eight hours five days per week.
i used to go there at eight a.m.
it was a company located in dokki so it was slightly near to my house.
i started to be like a tracker we adjust our schedule and so on actually.
and continuously working i mean for example i used to work for example every hour i used to take a break a 15 minutes break.
we ask each other more frequently it's not a desk job and that's it.
but i mean i liked the job nature that was in the company.
yes, frankly as a student at college actually.
working life is something amazing it's beautiful but full of risks and then you're alone so if things messed up so body you have to handle it alone.
so working life is definitely good, be of its advantages is that it's risky as well and you can get profit of course ; however, student life is a little bit lazy that you love .. learning bit by bit. i mean you still have have time to learn then go for the working life instead of rushing to the working life instantly
i have tried working individually before at university and it was really exhausting and difficult
i actually succeeded as i got certain grades for example or the project became very good. i'm proud of it but i was not pleased with the journey of the project. i am not pleased with the four month project.
when i attended the internship and when i went the course, we used to take a lot of tutorials and everybody was sharing so i enjoyed that very much.
not all of us was working and there were so many problems but i felt that the team and i were supporting each other as they can explain everything to me .
until the situation became very disorganized, it was .. was a better experience rather than individual work
once before i had a partner in the team
what i am trying the most is that once you had a break, you stopped working
you don't have to exert much effort in order to reach something just stop and have a break
you take it step-by-step restored with him too tackle the problem step by step simply at all all as if we are going to learn from the beginning as if you are kids
being simple makes you feel that you're not alone and it's okay to make mistakes and it's okay that you are not as the same level as the other people so you will start feeling some security then you have energy to continue
yes i have traveled before to romania
it was a camp .. camp for two weeks
the camp was for two weeks as well  the camp was sponsored by organization international organization
the idea is that you go to this camp that has to do with swimming training that i used to attend.
you go there to train people and teach them . in addition to this, they used to have a competition by the end with fourteen members from different countries and you started talking with them about the cultures there
how do you live together? how do you eat? how do you earn money? what about your jobs?
it is as if you got to know many countries
there were a lot of places; for example, if i'm going to talk about the best place in egypt, it will be dahab, the blue hole or three pools
those were .. were great times as when we went there before, we spent .. spent three days alone in the camp
so it was really good because it's one of the best places that i have ever seen, to be honest and i will not regret traveling the long road to go there
the best place abroad? i can see that it was a really good because i have been to only one country
the country that i traveled was all about forests so the experience was new for me as i haven't seen this before in egypt at all so for me it was good and i will never forget it
of course i will travel
of course i will travel
traveling is nothing but when you want to travel and try new things, it's already an experience that helps you learn everything like how to manage your time how to manage your money and what you are going to spend on food. you will take spending money into consideration
you get to know new people so your way of thinking will change for example you spent say twenty two or twenty three years with people that have the same mindset but when you go there, you will find that the society is not easily persuaded of anything that you say
you should find a way to persuade them
so the experience was really good, it's better not to miss such chance once you got it
a turning point  in my life? once there was something related to my father, yes, my father . he was in a coma and was suffering from some problems that i started to feel more responsible.
he was in a coma for three months that i was responsible for his work and i had to deal with the problems there as .. i felt that i became more mature a little bit . it's not only about working but also leaving my family alone and being at university to finish that projects at university that i have there in addition to meeting my university colleagues so i felt that it would be better if i balanced between both of them
it taught me how to balance between them and that's it
it usually depends on the person in front of me. if i feel that the person in front of me really wants to talk with me and to ice break, i start talking with him freely but for me, i really like ice breaking . i don't like being isolated from people.
i love talking with people freely and it's not necessarily to be right or wrong or, for example, or to be upset with me or angry from me but with all my respect, of course but i really like to get along with people so you should love this and learn how to do this.
so i felt that i have .. i am educated, actually, i won't say that it's a gift but i am educated so i feel free to talk and it's okay with me no matter what as long as it's in a respectful way.
i don't know what to say, yes but i should change my way of speaking, there's a special way you use when you deal with strangers unlike the way you use to deal with those you live with. so it will be different, of course but no i can talk with them but in a different way
i mean if somebody that got used to me realized that i have totally changed my way with one hundred eighty degree so when he sees me, he will say that i am not used to speaking this way.
definitely, yes when i speak with another person so this is the way how i can let them understand my view point.so it depends. i shouldn't have only one way to let people understand my point.
i will start with the good thing but i will laugh about the weird one at the end
it's good for me a little bit. it's not about being courageous but rather about .. about being spontaneous as i say what i think at once as i don't even think about it or repeat those words
so .. definitely, i am trying to do my best avoid this disadvantages this as much as i can
but yes, i am very honest and i usually like meeting my friends
i usually like checking on people even those who don't care
i love checking on everyone
i really love .. helping people
it makes me internally pleased, it may be nonsense. i may not believe this but this is the truth.
what i usually say is that i am a little bit honest
being honest is not .. not humiliating to the one in front of me.i mean if somebody did something wrong with me and i wanted to criticize him, i won't speak with him bluntly but it's totally the opposite as i will start speaking a step by step with him
if i don't care about this person, it will not care.
something that's weird, that i am very silly
yes actually, i mean my bachelor in particular
my doctor
once i took such a start, he made me feel that i shouldn't do this at all as it's very trivial
so once he said that it's trivial, i became in the mood
but yes, it's because of the courses that we have at university and because of the doctors and tas at university, you are forced to act like this way, to go freely in this path
yes, i can live without a mobile
actually, the mobile is not a great part of my life because i made myself busy doing other things, for example, as i said i usually read, as for my reading, i love the .. don't love the soft copies
i train how to talk with people more
as for the mobile part, if i want to contact with somebody who's far from me that i can't reach him, i can't meet him, i won't be able to speak with him this way that he was away or even if there's an emergency and he cannot come then he did his best to come
a situation for example, or a specific idea, or what?
to make you persuaded of this?
if you have a shower with cold water everyday, will you lose weight.
the idea that you take a shower with cold water may make you crazy, as nobody will take a cold shower but you will take a cold shower, okay?
a step by step at first except that you feel as if you are dropped off from a plane or you went skydiving, it's really hard as you cannot breathe, you .. you cannot understand this
you feel that it's easy for two or three minutes and everything is okay although the situation is difficult for example, you will jump from a plane, as you will make something great so you will feel great
in this way, no, you feel that it's normal and that you can do anything like doing exercises, running, swimming or doing anything, your adrenaline will make you gain an experience .. you will feel wow so that you can do anything
how to lose wait? as you will walk a lot and think and of course, you won't eat
try this
you're most welcome
okay, i was born in kuwait
i lived there for eighteen years.
then i come to egypt to join university
i went to an international school
i used to be in an igs i mean just before i joined university
once i am done with igs, i went to egypt as soon as possible
i came here in 2010
and i have been living here on my own for nine years.
okay i thought that the first year at university was really difficult
i wasn't actually sure which department department i wanted to join.
joining the faculty of engineering was mostly right because i am the only boy for my parents so i can't be anything other than an engineer or a doctor
but given the circumstances and i am already the only boy so i had troubles dealing with people in general.
i'm sort of introvert a little
i felt that this is the most suitable field for me personally
because dealing with computers is a lot easier than dealing with human being
actually, the social aspect in my life was minor and the component was very weak
so i was not able to deal with people so it was more comfortable with dealing with computers
so plus that i was good at it actually
i mean i remember when i was in cs one, yes, i got b minus but but i used to explain to others
may be the grades weren't fair due to the circumstances
but in cs two i think i got an a easily actually
okay so i guess that my study was normalized normally like anybody else in my class
i think it's all cs projects, except maybe for my bachelor project
my bachelor project was about 3d object recognition which was something fancy actually at that time.
actually, yes, now the situation becomes easy but at that time in two thousand and fifteen, the project was a little bit difficult for me
actually, i spent more than two months and every day, i spend from twelve to sixteen hours in front of my laptop alone
so i believe actually that it is one of the defining experiences in my life
i felt that yes this is what hard work actually means
my usual routine is that i feel as much as i can that i sleep seven hours as a block
i don't my sleeping time
i may spend a whole year taking three or four naps in total
i really hate taking a nap in the middle of the day as i wake up suffering from headache. i don't like this so i try as much as i can to sleep for one block for seven hours, that's it
if i sleep at eleven o'clock, i get up at five o'clock.
if i sleep actually no sorry from eleven till five o'clock around six hours
if i sleep at eleven o'clock, i get up at six o'clock.
if i sleep at eleven o'clock, i get up at five o'clock and so on.
but once i get up, obviously actually i read a few articles. actually, once you get up, you are supposed to take a cold shower because this shock makes blood migrate into the inner organs rather than the outer organs.
so it sort of gives you like a awake up call, it alerts you.
because your organs have entered a sort of hibernation state while you are asleep.
so once you take a cold shower, water i mean blood flows into the organs out actually away from the skin cells
so it actually works
actually the cold shower makes you awake
but yes actually and as soon as i take my shower i just get my breakfast and come to uni or work actually
unfortunately i'm not a very sportive person
so i watch tv series and this is the only thing i do in weekends
that's it
actually netflix mainly
okay, the last movie i have watched was split
i wanted to go and watch a movie called glass
i felt that i have watched unbreakable although it was very old movie that i watched long ago
i really liked it
and obviously glass is based on unbreakable and split
i watched split and it was actually really interesting.
actually, the concept of multi-personality disorder is really really interesting.
actually when i watched youtube videos that discuss a topic a little bit fancy topic
as at one point, there was a woman that a man was asking her questions and she was replying having a certain attitude, tone and way after that with a few minutes exactly, he asked her the same question and she answered in a different way and the content of the answer is totally different
her tone of voice is totally different and the accent sort of even it becomes a little bit different as if she is southern i mean the southern states although she is not southern at all
actually, it's a little bit creepy.
so but actually it's an interesting movie
very interesting
my favorite author or who i love reading for is khaled el husseiny
the theme of khaled elhusseiny in general is just pain trauma which is painful drama actually which is the only thing that teaches human being honestly
actually all his books are good but maybe the book that influenced me the most was and the mountains echoed.
i believe actually
it was .. was a very gloomy book honestly
generally, the author is from an afghan background
he was a refugee actually and left afghanistan and went to pakistan then migrate to the us.
so all his stories are themed around the refugees and the war that started in afghanistan and so on.
as the story tackles a character that lived during the war and actually how did she stumble upon one family to the other
and then how the war influenced them although this woman was from a very wealthy family
and how she went down and lived in a low state and it's really bad actually
but and and how did she find i guess a true love
eventually, there should be the part of love and imaginary in order to make an entertaining story actually i guess
i guess it depends on the geographical state that we will be in
actually, i'm not sure honestly as i should stay in egypt or leave
actually, i'm not settled yet
so it's assuming to travel another country so i'm guessing that any school will do
actually, there's a standard of education and there's not a great difference
most probably the majority of schools are almost the same thing
otherwise, if i am here in egypt, i guess since that there is a great diversity in schools such as the experimental, international, national and the elite schools
it's really very diverse and very difficult
it's a very difficult choice
so i guess personally that i choose the french schools for girls i guess
based on my personal experience, some of friends in my class are actually graduates of french and i felt that their education level, their level of education is really good and very satisfying at least
so based on that based on my previous experience and what i noticed from my friends, i think that such schools will be most suited for my kids, i guess.
well, i'm guessing or actually i'm not guessing that being a ta is not my dream job
i don't believe that it's anyone's dream job
i personally try to acquire a position in an r and d.
but the problem is on the r and d position i mean that the r and d requires the academia
and i don't like the academia
but it's a temporary state and it is a requirement
so i'm trying to pass through this phase so that i can move on to an r and d for example it could be a corporate or it could be a research center institute.
it shouldn't be related to the academia
and the internships that i attended as i have attended an internship before in an oil company
i used to work with the network administrator
we used to try to set up sort of a network because they are ip cams it should all log in on the server so the owner of the company that lived in the us and he wanted to log in to see what's going in his company through his ipad so it was interesting
actually, i acquired a lot of knowledge about the networks in general based on this project.
so this that was one interesting internship, honestly
actually, this actually from the little internships that i was forced to work on on my own and to deal with a lot of people
unlike the usual time you spend in your room using your laptop as you code your tasks and send emails and that's it
i do not think that i want to be student anymore
i'm actually i don't enjoy academic to be honest
i'm not .. i don't enjoy teaching teaching process
to me this is just a temporary phase with it as soon as possible and i'm trying to get done
being a student obviously would be something interesting if i'm learning something interesting
actually if i got a phd position for something that i actually really like i'd definitely be interested to be a student once again actually
but for the time being i'm looking for a job and such actually .. no i would like to go back to the market now actually
i have traveled to so many places, honestly
but the longest period of time i spent was in holland netherlands, i stayed there for a year
i stayed in germany for four months
so i guess the most remarkable moment is when i .. was in the greenery actually
actually, i really lack this here in cairo, honestly
i remember one day when one of my friends visited me and we sat in front of rijksmuseum that is the rembrandt museum
yes, the rijksmuseum and the rembrandt museum are close to each other
anyways actually there's a greenery place and it's like a patch sort of hill
but it's a made-up hill actually
so we stayed there
we stayed for three or four hours
the weather was really good
i think that that day was the most remarkable day for me in the whole year actually
i made friends but not at work
it's very difficult making friends at work
i actually made more friends from the course of deutsch that i used to study
so that was pretty interesting
i'm still in touch with some of them, not all of them obviously
but i don't think that i make other friends
yes they were but they were with me at the dutch course
on the top of my mind right now actually i would love to go to japan, honestly
to me, it's a very interesting place
actually, i think i would love to go to japan anytime soon.
that next to switzerland as well
actually, i've always looked forward to visiting switzerland
but definitely the price tag of each trip, no matter how little it is, it becomes bigger honestly so it's something to think twice about actually
it depends on the scholarship itself
it depends on the position that's offered actually and the scholarship that's an offer as well
i am guessing obviously a scholarship is something nice to have and a position is obviously something to seek for whether or not this is something suitable to me right now that it's a very difficult decision actually and that's it
i guess there were a lot of turning points
but i believe maybe the first six months after work was the turning point in my life as i felt that i'm no longer a child actually
actually, i'm an adult and i'm responsible for myself
and it's .. the stress at work was really violent at that time of my life in particular so i felt that okay actually this is the difficult choice to make
that are you happy?
if so are you i mean is there something you can do to make you more happy or less unhappy?
so i believe that's one of the turning points
okay i, as a student, i personally prefer working individually not in group projects
but now that i worked i believe that it became different
and i really appreciate the group work
however i would always prefer that the task given to me is not a task that i need to do for somebody
actually, assuming that there are pools of tasks so assign to me tasks as many tasks as you want and i submit those tasks to you so as he can continue working on the tasks or he adds this to another part
he and i will not be working on the same task
actually assuming that if there are a presentation or a report that need to be made, i can be responsible for the presentation and he will be responsible for the report or vice versa
it's not necessary to work on the presentation together or to work on the report together
i feel that's counter-productive actually
there are but outside university
i believe that my personal role model right now is elon musk
he is that kind of person who wakes up at 4 am actually
because he is the one who made space x
he is the one who made paypal
he is the one who made tesla
so so .. yes this is definitely something i look up to actually
i believe you can never actually target the .. or actually tackle the idea of liking someone or loving someone no matter how good you are as a person either be .. actually you'll always be criticized in a way
so if we will talk about the personal sorry the professional perspective and career-wise i believe i'd rather be respected than liked
yes, being loved among your colleagues at work is obviously something that you would love to find and something that you would seek but it's impossible
you will never be loved by all your colleagues at work
it's almost impossible
so i'd rather be liked, honestly
get things done faster
i believe that no i'm not an approachable person at all
actually i'm not an easy person to deal with at all
but at work actually as long as we are at work yes it's simple and easy
but as for the personal level no, i take a lot of time to come on to someone and just actually be natural with them actually
so there are always a lot of layers before dealing with a normal person as he's somebody i have known since ages
indecisiveness
i hate indecisive people
i don't like for example the concept of having a meeting no so let's all decide no we can do a or we can say that we will do b or it could be c, which is okay this is not going to work
so it's okay as all these options are on the table but we need to make a decision
that if you are indifferent and passive to everything i mean then we might not have this meeting
actually, i feel that it's pointless
but not at university
i'm sure that i've done this once or twice within an interview which i think is allowed, i mean, in an interview.
but i don't do this inside the class
actually once when one of one of the students asks me if i don't i mean if something .. i mean if somebody asks me whether i know this or not, i tell him.
no and when i was .. no during the evaluation yes when i was a student yes when i was having evaluations definitely
yes i definitely
exactly actually
i definitely had to do that
but now, as a teacher, no, i definitely don't do that
actually when somebody asks whether i know this or not, i say no and i ask him to send me an email then i will reply with the answers as soon as possible.
i guess in the evaluations i remember in particular actually when there were many situations, it definitely did help me up
actually it means that if i spoke about the project and how much effort i exert and what to-do-list i prepare regarding this class and the other class and i guess that it worked eventually actually
not proud of it but it did happen honestly yes.
no because the majority of people that i deal with on daily basis are not there around me
actually my parents live outside egypt so i will never be able to communicate with them if i don't have a mobile
it's almost impossible actually
i think that one of the most important points that people skip or don't care about is sleeping seven hours
actually, this is that you have no idea how much research shows actually actually very very important for a human being
i mean as much as that people stop growing after twenty-five and that you are already after twenty-five it's a countdown for you to die basically
but sleeping seven hours is .. is so vital
actually research shows that sleeping less than seven hours will actually actually i mean .. will actually most probably lead to elevated heart beat so the blood pressure will rise, you'll be susceptible to the slightest things happening at work actually, so you will be passive-aggressive, you will be overweight easily
definitely, i'm not exactly sure what i am not sure of casualty and effect in everything, actually how each one happens, but actually i'm sure that i've read a research that shows that all of this happens if you sleep less than seven hours
so i feel that one of the underrated things is that somebody sleeps less than seven hours
i'm sure that you don't want to lose weight at one point and you don't want to suffer from high blood pressure at any point in time soon
so if you want to avoid these two things you definitely need exactly or more than seven hours .. actually to sleep less than seven hours as a block actually.
actually, i was born here in cairo here in egypt
i used to be at traditional national schools and all of them are arabic before university
then i joined guc, then when i was graduated from guc, i became a ta
i was at university, then i worked as a ta at the same university where i used to study till now
i started to be .. interested in my .. my major starting from semester 3 at university although at the beginning totally against it, i didn't want to go for this major at all
starting from semester three, i felt that i am more interested rather than the other majors
and starting from semester three i decided that i will continue in this major until i graduate, god willing
my bachelor project is about something entitled semantic web
most of the search engines there were .. were working on their .. their .. their logic based on the linguistic part that the user enter regardless of its meaning and what he means by this
we used to try to make a semantic search engine that reasons or understands the user that writes a term in the .. the search engine and what he means by that trying to show the best results that can fit the .. the term or the query that the user entered
i do nothing except for getting up, having breakfast and getting dressed
so basically the weekend is just for resting and sleeping and the .. the extra thing that can be done is to visit my .. family, relatives and so on, that's it
my hobbies are mostly reading and the .. the .. the computer games, if i can call it a hobby, that's it
maybe i read a lot of books and all of them are good
most of them were novels actually they are not .. not .. not scientific books or something
a novel entitled morning and evening talk by naguib mahfouz was one of my favorites, and when i watched the .. dramatic adaptation as it was adapted into a series or something and it was adapted in a very well presentation
there was the prisoner of zenda and it was also very well.
and actually, the second part that most people don't know that it has a second part that was entitled rupert of hentzau
it was the second part of the prisoner of zenda
those what i can still remember for now
those what i really liked the most
i haven't watched movies in a long time, but the movies that i watched that were very impactful on me were troy and most of harry potter series when i used to watch them when i was young
titanic  when i watched it for the first time.
at that time the .. the directing of the movie was very persuasive of its exact message . even if this is opposite to what you are persuaded of, he can direct you to the idea that he wants to say exactly and who you sympathize with, who you don't sympathize with, who you love, who you hate, you see the movie in his own eyes exactly like what he wants actually
those what i can remember now
i don't remember anything else actually
yes
i still don't have children but in general i didn't .. didn't think of a specific school
it's not about being an international or a national school but it's based on the school itself and the .. the .. the environment over all that the .. that the son will be there one day
it's not necessarily that a national school is bad or that the international school is very good but no it depends on the school itself
it has .. actually has certain standards that one will think of at that time i mean to make sure that there's a healthy environment around him
and students like him should have certain standards as such standards i want my child to learn from school
as for the languages, he should have the.the .. the secondary language based on the school no matter is it english, french or deutsch, no problem
but what i am really interested in is that .. he didn't abandon his mother tongue which is arabic, no he should know arabic well and he should speak arabic and discuss everything in arabic but still he has a secondary language that's very strong that will help him scientifically or anything related to the job market or something
in the software development
no the .. the working life is better for me by far
i don't .. don't .. don't want to be as a student anymore or to have the .. the .. the hassle of attending lectures and solving assignments and .. and exams and midterms and things like that i don't .. don't to go back to this ever
even the time when i was working on the masters here when i was a kind of a student was not .. not .. not a good time at all actually.
all the activities that are a kind of student activities when it comes to readings and getting papers to find out something and things like that was really bad for me and i don't like to go back to this kind of activities again.
definitely, if it's based on routine, it could be long term very boring daily routine .. but if you enjoy it, it will reduce the chances of feeling bored with what you do throughout the day especially that it's like teaching.
as for teaching, each semester, you meet new people and interact with them differently according to their different mentalities that you need to address all of these mentalities differently in order to deliver your message or to deliver your content in a good way to these students
so at least i really love teaching and i feel that it's a kind of challenge, first of all whatever the level of students in front of you, you should deliver what you want to say in whatever way as you should find a way through which they can understand what you say as well as the content that you need to deliver to them correctly and in an efficient way so that they understand you regardless it's technically good or, it's not technically good
so this kind of challenge .. satisfies me honestly
that i %b .. try to overcome it in a way or another
socially, you pass by so many people of different mentalities, from different environments, from different levels so i see that's good
by time although i didn't like the .. the .. the .. the student life, the guc is a comfort zone for me
so therefore i don't mind at all to stay here even if there's a routine-based aspect
once when i was in the eighth semester, i was in an internship at the software development company
as for our .. our .. our normal life, we were divided into teams there
each team was responsible for a part of a product that they made with .. with different teams that were there
i was in the team of the development there and we used to practice on the developing .. developing software with language c++
it was .. was a very good experience for me, i could feel how people were working on the software development and it was actually one of my preferable parts for me although i became a ta after that but i was very pleased with
and if i get the chance later on, god willing, to .. to shift my career to something related to software development i .. i wouldn't mind at all ..
no
last time i went to north coast last summer
it's only leisure time actually
one can go there, wake up, go to the .. the beach, then come back and eat, sleep and so on, nothing more
this is surprising for some people but it's marsa matrouh
the .. the .. the environment there was really good, the sea was really good, calm and clean and the landscapes that look naturally were nice in addition to so many places that you can visit such as museums and so on
in general, the weather there is better than that in other places that i visited
and .. and i have no problem to go there once, twice, thrice
the first turning point was in semester three when i decided to continue in the major cs
because before this %b .. %b .. the .. the decisions for me were far away from cs, it was electronics or mechatronics for example or something
as the turning point that the course of cs3 and that was the turning point for me
because i felt that i really enjoy this .. this and i really excel things like computer science and at the same time things related to the other major like circuits and things like that that i .. i did miserably in these courses actually
so a huge turning point was when i choose a major and go for another major at all
the same happens before i joined university
at the beginning i was about to join another university then by mere chance one of my friends told me about the guc
and i had .. had an impression about the guc because it's guc but the other place that i was about to go required a specific language
because that was the language there and i don't know this language
but i knew from him that the .. the university doesn't require having a specific language so i can join it anyways
so by chance, i went there and took the test and i passed the test
then i joined guc
it was swingy at all actually
maybe not at all
actually i have like a kind of standards and kind of a goal that i try to pursue in my own way regardless of how other people did it previously
no i i would say that i am very very easy person to deal with
on the contrary, i'm a very considering person as i try to understand the person in front of me and know how he speaks and deal with him in the same way that he uses to interact with me
yes i feel that i need to change the way i deal with people in general but i don't feel that it's difficult
on the contrary, i feel that it's part of the social intelligence actually
and this is a skill as far as i think people should have this skill in particular especially that if you interact with different levels of people
and i have to deal with all of these students in a good way
it's not necessary to be in a specific level and i prefer this level and if somebody is away from this level, i don't deal with him in a good way.
on the contrary i don't feel that's difficult
yes, it's important to change the way how he deals with different persons and different personalities and so on but i don't feel that's difficult actually
no i prefer to be respected rather than liked
i am not interested to be liked or not liked but rather respected because respect comes over love
you may love somebody very much but by the end he won't respect him
he sees him .. loves him because he does something that he likes but the overall picture i see is that he is not a respectful person
the .. the respect can be found even if the person doesn't like you, or he doesn't accept you because of something else but overall to gain his respect is not easy at all rather than to be liked
maybe you are liked for illegal reasons
you may be liked for  inappropriate reasons
that you do something that he sees it as a good thing after all as he sees that he does not gain his respect
that to gain a respect of someone is more important than to be liked
yes, it could be but i don't make it as a dead end
if there's a chance, i will try, if not, i won't try to deal with him again
but the .. the .. the stubborn person is the one who sticks to a certain viewpoint and he shapes everything around
so dealing with these kind of people is very very difficult and no matter how often you try once, twice or thrice, most probably you don't reach anything
but at some point i am trying not to close the door
no there's at least a chance as we can make an extra trial with him maybe he will start being more flexible actually
i have .. have never done this at all
on the contrary, most of the interviews that i attended and i say everything very very very honestly as i told them that i really didn't know that topic and that i cannot answer this question
although people advise me to avoid showing that you don't understand but i would prefer to speak about something that i do understand rather than fabricate the answer saying nonsense just to try .. to impress them with something that they don't even know so he would say this .. this .. this is good and i pass it but i don't .. don't do that
okay what was the reaction of the person in front of you the interviewer? what was his reaction? or what did he tell you? did he remain silent did you remain silent?
it happened twice, once he didn't give any impression at all, as for the second time he was surprised because i said so.
he was surprised because i .. i said that i didn't know and that the one who had an interview said that he didn't know this topic
but by the way in .. in both interviews i got accepted
but i got accepted and that they didn't reject me because i said that i didn't understand that topic
honestly i doubt
unfortunately, i can feel this unfortunately actually our .. our .. our lifestyle is based on the mobile and internet mainly
so the mobile means to have internet everywhere
you have your mobile everywhere
you can do a lot using your internet as you can check the news and social media through it and so on
one can feel that when the internet connection is weak, or when there's no internet at all no i feel that i stay in .. in .. in .. in a black hole that i cannot interact with people around me or i don't know what's happening
this is not good but as far i think most of the life style of people now is like that
actually no, i can say that i cannot live without internet or mobile
i would say  that you don't .. don't do anything if your major is computer science, don't do any research if you don't want to continue in a research track
as for the major of computer science, most of the .. the job market don't appreciate whatever in a research track especially if it's not practical, it won't benefit them at work
if you are about to work in the software development company part one, two or three, they will check your skills that have to do with the job duties
what will they be able to take from you at work?
but if you say that you worked on masters in a certain field and you prepared a paper to attend a conference and that you applied for a journal and that was a .. a .. a .. a .. very impactful journal and so on
it's okay with all of this and then, what will you do at work?
so if you decided at the beginning that you want to continue the academic career, i would rather say do not try to pursue this field at all
or even you try to say that you'll complete masters and then go
most probably you will complete masters for your own sake
but if you target target the job market from day one anything that would lead you to the job market even if it's a very small start-up or anything that will offer you an experience and to .. to .. to .. to .. to .. to support your cv regarding what you especially are pursuing in the field of computer science
but if you feel that you are an academic person and that you want to continue the academic career then you'll be a ta then a doctor then a professor and so on, no you have to go this way and you know what you need in order to continue in this track successfully actually
i was born in cairo anyways
first, i live in gesr el suez then i moved into elrehab then i moved into nasr city then i went back to elrehab
i went to two .. three schools as well
when i was in the kg, i was at ..
when i was in the kg, i went to a school and i moved to another school in the primary stage then i moved to a third school in the preparatory and secondary stages
all of them where national but english schools actually
but after that i joined university
first of all, i joined university so as to go for mechatronics or production, okay?
and then at first i was a little bit hesitated whether i would go for electronics or networks but i joined mechatronics as well
but after i joined mechatronics, i discovered that i am good at the subjects that related to .. cs actually
that is cs or .. or .. or any other subjects related to electricity
but for the .. the mechanical subjects that i used to .. to pass but i got c minus or c
so i decided that i said no  i will try think on my own about this so i said if i left cs, what would happen
i was about to be in semester four so anyways i should repeat four subjects and so on
but when i was at the end of the semester, i decided that no i should be careful while making this decision so as not to regret it later on and i moved to met
i thought that i was only one department until they told me that there are departments for dmet and cs
why did i go for dmet?
i can't remember to be honest with you
i really cannot remember why i went for dmet instead of cs
but actually i didn't regret taking this decision
no, i don't usually regret
okay now actually .. actually i devote my time to three aspects
it's university or bachelor a, training and the third is something called hyperloop
at cairo university that i have just joined recently
most probably my day is divided upon these three or it's for only one of them
i mean for example i get up no i get up now whenever i want at 12 pm for example
but i either go to university or stay at home to work on the bachelor and at night i go to the training three times a week
now on friday i go and exercise american football almost every friday as i watch matches or if i don't go there, i hang out with my friends anyways
okay not really actually
actually, there's no exercise but this the most that ..
regardless that i go to the training, even when i stay at home i go and search .. search to learn more about this topic by watching videos and reading about the rules and that's it
okay first of all, the bachelor
it started that i .. i am supposed to do something called tracking objects using something called stereo camera
stereo camera is an ordinary camera but they .. they are actually two cameras okay?
so it's being used instead now if we use a specific camera okay to know the distance between the camera and the other thing, if it's only one camera it will work but with .. with estimation
actually for example if you know that .. this person's average density is so and he can see his weight so he will estimate the distance between the camera and the other thing
but if we have a stereo camera and in certain ways we can use it to estimate the distance between the camera and the specific two objects this way, okay?
that by using two cameras so it's related to maths and so on but i didn't go into it
but i totally changed it until it becomes something else
at first  i was trying to .. to detect the object in general and to find out how i can know that's only one object so that i can estimate this region that this particular object has nothing to do with the surroundings
so i went for deep learning and computer vision and so on i am still reading in this topic
hyperloop is totally different it's ..
do you know elon musk?
okay actually if you know elon musk and if you know space x or tesla?
okay he is the owner of those two companies, he is the founder of those two companies
then he made something called hyperloop
such hyperloop is like a transportation method as it looks like a closed tube and it has low pressure like the vacuum and the pods pass through it to transport people from one place to another
it's like a train but without wheels actually as it is moving on something called air cushion actually the air is pushing it downwards so that there will be a distance between it and the ground and it moves with very high speeds because there's no drag force maybe because the pressure is 0.1 percent from the atmospheric pressure
so it moves with very high speed and with low cost because the tube is placed above the solar panels so it powers itself in general
so .. and the user of the motor that they use is the same as the motor that is in tesla which is an electric motor .. motor so there's no fuel consumption.
the important part is that they made a competition for students to let them .. them participate as they should build pod but a little bit smaller and .. we travel to perform actually the pod that is performed in .. in america in a certain place that we still don't know
and we are trying actually they are trying to see the best one who created the breaking system and the best one to maintain safety and so on and even they evaluate it according to many aspects so we are still making a team and so on
no
no
i do love movies.
my most favorite movie is dark knight rises
it's about batman of course all people know it
should i tell the events of the movie?
a brief story is that  that batman wasn't there for a long time at .. at generally actually for reason that was in the previous movie and .. and but he was forced to come back because there's somebody actually was about to come and he wanted to .. to turn the whole city where he stayed upside down
that's it and he beat him at the end and there was a war
it was a very good movie
honestly, i still don't .. don't care about the job but i do care about the place
actually, i wanted to go to a country .. some countries where i wish to live so whoever will come with me should understand me?
unfortunately, no
honestly, each has its comfortable aspects actually at university, i was free sometimes but this is not the case with working definitely
i would work to be independent and this is the good point that i am looking forward to
i have traveled twice
okay first i traveled to sweden in two thousand and thirteen
i was playing handball with my team
we stayed there for two weeks
the best was the .. the championship where we participated and we found many people there because they liked the handball actually they can go and watch the match in the stadium and so on
so the championship was an important event in the city there
so the first thing is the great diversity actually there were teams from different countries in the world as all of them were almost in that place. in addition to this, people who were living there attended the matches and a great number was .. and the opening celebration for example the stadium was totally full not with not only the teams but also people .. people who were living there
it was like .. a festival in the streets all the time as there were a lot of people who were .. were living there
second i have been to saudi arabia for umrah
i which i can live abroad
first canada or australia
canada and australia in the first place. canadians don't exercise .. racism as they have morals so they will welcome everyone
actually people there i don't feel that .. that i am not welcomed there and i can feel that i am a stranger
in addition to this, there are arabs there in every where
in australia .. australia .. life is a little bit easy
actually working there is not that difficult for them
their minimum wage is high
actually even if i .. i go to australia for example i have no problem with working anything that doesn't relate to my major
i could work as bus driver i have no problem with that
it's important to have an experience to live abroad in a country like that
no i just felt that i don't want to .. to continue in a field that i am not sure about and that happened when i was in mechatronics actually
i didn't want to regret making this decision after graduation then i would say that i should or .. or that i meet somebody to tell me to join mechatronics and i would say no as i .. joined mechatronics but i wish i could joined another department
no .. no i didn't like to go for .. for this even if .. even if i changed the major and then graduated, i wouldn't like this. if i had remained in mechatronics, i wouldn't have known that it was a mistake
it's okay i have no problem with that i don't regret anything like that
honestly, the experience with the team wasn't that good .. no but in some cases the team .. was good in general . to me, i have no problem with both options honestly because in both cases, i would work on tasks individually
as well i have no problem to help someone else even if it's not my part actually.
i have no problem
yes elon musk
that he will change everything now like the global warming that .. things like that are dangerous for the .. environment in general the global warming is like the .. how i can call it?
in general it .. it .. is related to .. to fossil the burning of fossil fuels actually as it .. it was the most important part in his life
actually he .. dedicated .. his life for this and in general he is a very successful person
i wish i could be like him one day
of course to be liked is better
no no i am a very easy person and it's okay i have no problem actually it's not annoying to talk with people
yes.sometimes i deal with them ..
actually maybe i .. somehow i stereotype this as if i find the person in front of me is from .. from a certain type that i got used to deal with, i will deal with him according to this concept even if he is not like that, it means that i still don't know him but i am just assuming
the best quality that i see about myself is that i don't get annoyed .. annoyed with people at all no matter what they did to me
outside university yes i sometimes do this
no actually sometimes maybe for example i am in a debate with somebody and .. any of my friends okay and i my feel that i want what i am going to say will be understood so i will say nonsense and i know that i am saying nonsense okay
and i can tell him after that that i was saying nonsense actually
no they believe
for a certain period of time or in general?
it depends. if i don't have a mobile and the whole world is the same like me?
yes, yes, no, it's okay i am talking about the .. the phone calls actually
no actually for me .. for me the phone calls are very important to me actually but i don't care about the other options
what should i tell you and how should i start?
if you are pleased here, no you should stay here
so i can .. actually i haven't been there honestly but i can go somewhere and i don't enjoy this and i feel that dealing with people is difficult for example or something, here i deal with people more easily so i can go back it's okay
i don't think that i should do this honestly.
i am originally from alexandria and i stayed there until i was four years old
at first, i was in a français pre-school but when we moved into alexandria .. when we moved from cairo. my mother doesn't know français but papy does but he started a new job and so on and it was a start up and so on that he couldn't have time to follow up with me so i had to go to an english school
i went to a national school and that's it
when i joined university at the very beginning, once i joined university i chose major materials and .. but later on because it's somehow related to my father's work and so on but after i changed my mind
i found this in .. in .. in .. in with many people and i saw their work related to mechatronics and so on
a very close friend of mine was .. was in mechatronics and .. and he persuaded me to join this field and i liked what he said to me so that's why i went for it
okay
my bachelor project is actually somehow related to the optical field
it's prepared in .. in the lab of optics
and after that actually it's the introduction of the research .. actually the medical research
we will use it later on after .. after that the results are supposed to be out so that it can be used in the medical research for .. for the sensors actually
it .. it could be used later on as anyone can detect the weight of the weight of cells cancer cells for example, the weight any kind of bacteria that its mass is very small that it's difficult for anyone to detect it actually with the .. the ordinary balance
okay my daily routine is that i start by doing something that nobody does in egypt actually
for example, all people kept telling me that they drink nescafe or coffee and so on but for me i don't drink any of these, and not even tea or anything like that
actually when i wake up i can drink milk like kids or like when i was in the pre-school  .. and i still drink mix mix chocolate milk
for example, if i get up too early because my brother's school is near to my university, sometimes i drive him to school after that i go to university and it's still vacant that i can park my car easily in the parking area as i park my car on the first row of the parking area which is really good because in the midday i can easily find my car at once
that's it and now i go to the lab because this is my bachelor
and actually for example i run my experiments or something, if i don't do this, i can write the reports or something
and after that we all started to feel hungry so we all leave the lab and go out to eat and have fun for some time then we come back and keep fighting to .. to choose who is going to continue working in the set up and so on
that's it .. and we are supposed to leave the lab at four o'clock and this never happened  .. actually maybe if we finish our tasks early, we can leave early and this what we like the most actually
and if we aren't done, i should stay working the whole day till the night comes actually once i stayed there till 9 pm
so  that's it and on the midday if we finish early, i go and pick my brother up and go home
if i didn't finish early actually, i have intentions like anyone to lose weight and to go to the gym and to be super fit and so on, i was trying for a long time but i really love food very much
generally my hobbies do .. don't relate to my weekend plans or something no actually i can get up early in the morning and for example if i will not go anywhere, i can go to swim in the piscine of the club
and it's okay if i am stressed or something, i can run on the track actually
my hobbies are all about reading in general actually i love reading very much but it's not restricted to the weekend or something
no the majority of my readings are in .. in arabic, actually i really love history and in general this seems weird to anyone for example i chose major engineering or something but i love history very much since i was young actually
i have no .. specific examples of my favorite books but i have two favorites one like youssef zidan as i almost read all his novels and i just brought his new novel from the book fair but i haven't started reading it yet
i used to read the .. the genius of umar i used to read the genius of umar when i was young
i really like his style of writing because it's not easily understood from the first time you read and you love to read, as you love to read it more than once even his .. his style of writing is .. unique ..
in english %ma .. there was once something  something that was also somehow related to history, called the manuscript found in accra
i read it as well and it was really good especially because it's written by paulo coelho
definitely i read the alchemist by paulo coelho but i read it in arabic because i had the same topic in the arabic project in .. in the secondary stage as we were supposed to read the story and .. and analyze it and then summarize it, and that's it ..  and .. that's it
i mainly want to travel
i want to travel to germany
actually first of all i wanted to complete .. wanted to complete my masters
actually i wish i won't be late actually once i finish university .. once i am done with the five years of university, i will complete my masters at once but .. any plans after that .. yes the masters that i am interested in should be related to cars
but actually after that who don't wish to .. to work at mercedes benz or bmw or anything like that?
but actually .. actually still .. definitely when i will start something related somehow to .. to this field and i find it mentioned in masters, i will start to search for more aspects that i was not focusing on so at that time i can have something very specific that this .. this .. this is the dream job actually
the first internship that i attended was after semester four
i went to .. to the lab which was a chemical and analytical lab
i wasn't related that much with my field but i am having a .. a study about it
but i was .. actually i got it through one of my relatives
at that time .. i was somehow broken down because .. i didn't do well in semester four at university so i wanted to feel that i am .. am good at something and that i succeed in it in order to .. to get over this
so .. i started working there and i loved the experience as i went to work to interact with elder people even the idea that the field was different from what i studied that i learned a lot
i discovered that i have good information about chemistry
and that was the first time i felt that i spent a month and half and i didn't want to leave actually i have plans actually that .. whenever i have time, i go to work and so on even if i will go once a week or something
the second .. second internship i attended after semester six and i also got it through one of my relatives and it was in .. emirates in sharjah
it was really my life experience because i stayed with my aunt in dubai and i used to .. to work at the lab but it was petrol lab actually it was somehow related to my .. my field because there mechanical equipment and there were machines that they were making an assembly for it in order to .. to run on it the .. the .. the test
so i used to get up at 6 am to go to work at 8:30 and i used to take three buses, a metro and .. and a taxi and i spent two hours on my way to work
and definitely i wasn't .. wasn't familiar with the accent of the ..
yes i have traveled abroad . the first time i traveled was with my father when i was five years old . we went to turkey .. because papy was having job tasks there so we went with him
i had a situation there when my sister entered the toilette of the hotel and .. and she locked herself inside and she couldn't open the door
we kept calling the reception so that they could send somebody to us and until they sent us somebody, they didn't understand english easily and finally they sent us someone to open the door and she kept crying and so on
the second time is when i was in the third preparatory when we went to turkey as well but that time i was almost a grown-up and i still remember the details there and i have many photos there
the third time is when we went to lebanon, jordan and emirates but what was really weird was that we stayed for less than forty eight hours in each country because our main goal was to go to emirates and stay with my cousins and that's it .. as for lebanon and jordan, we went there because papy was having work there
so once we arrived, he went to work and we had a tour all over beirut in less than a day
then we went to oman
and .. and .. then to dubai
then a year later we went to dubai
then the next year we went to france
and that was the first time for me to travel to europe and so on
and definitely, the best place was disneyland actually i am a number one fan of disney since i was young and i have already memorized their songs till now
and .. and it was the first time to travel to a european country and so on
and after that last year i went to dubai again and that's it
i went to siwa, siwa oasis once with my friends from the club and we were all of the same young age
definitely, it was a very new experiences the hotel there wasn't a hotel it was the resort itself as you felt as if you live in an old place
and the country itself makes you feel that you used a time machine and that you went back even .. even we weren't familiar with people there .. we weren't familiar with the culture there and so on
but she is nice and very small and there weren't any kind of technology there or anything like that there were no cars there and if you look at the sky at night, you can see a very clear sky full of stars and so on .. actually it was really nice honestly
it was such an amazing landscape as you were staying in the desert listening to the deers' sounds and other weird sounds
and .. and we swam in the .. the sulphur springs and it was really nice
and luxor and aswan are nice too because i like monuments and things like that
but the other places like hurghada and sharm elsheikh are ordinary
no, sure, i will love to travel abroad to build my future and in a way or another i am still young and if i didn't build my future now or didn't work hard now and .. actually i should .. make a plan for the future
and my parents won't be pleased with me if i stayed with them doing nothing and .. this is what i really want long ago actually why not that i go for it
actually i won't delay it actually because i am afraid
definitely, i know that it won't be easy to stay alone and .. and it will be a big responsibility that i become responsible for myself and you no longer .. have anybody to help you in any problem but i think that they won't forget me and they will come and visit me and i will visit them of course
that .. actually throughout my life i am such a disorganized person as i throw my stuff everywhere and my room was never neat and so on because i know that my mother will keep shouting at me for awhile then she will organize everything
once she got up in the morning and she was very very tired that we had too take her to hospital then he found out that she was suffering from blood pressure so i felt that i made her devote her health and that i took her health for granted actually i used to think that it's okay to leave everything messy because she will come and tidy the mess
and i will pretend that i don't know but i realized that she was really tired and that we caused her problems
i felt that no i .. cannot continue this .. this way and that i should start to .. actually improve myself and .. actually i can even help her because now we are facing a problem that she is not feeling well so no i should help her and especially that i am her eldest daughter
yes, my father sure
i know that this answer is somehow biased and many people may say so  i really .. actually see him as a very smart and ambitious person
and .. and .. and he is a self-made man that built himself on his own .. and he is open-minded as he lived abroad for a long time and .. and i like his way of thinking and the way he .. he deals with people
and .. and actually even his mentality helps him think ninety percent right .. actually whenever he speaks about something, he has the evidence about it so it's already proved
and .. and he can foreshadow the events based on .. on his experience or something else that i don't know
and .. and he is a successful man in his work as he started his company from zero and now he is number one in his field and .. and his company is the best company to make the best turnover
he is a successful manager and engineer and .. and in addition to this he .. he was the champion of egypt in .. in and he was the egyptian national team coach of handball
he won the award of the best african player
and .. and they won the african championship and he received a sport medal and .. and he received a sport medal from .. from hosny mubarak
actually .. he speaks three more languages other than arabic
and that's it to me,  he is a great man
respected of course especially if this field is work or something like that
yes what i will benefit from somebody that likes me then .. actually maybe .. that for example we, as egyptians, have strong emotions somehow
but people abroad are very practical and they don't have the concept of intimacy at work as they evaluate people according to their performance at work
maybe for example because i talk with people, for example i interact with people in a good way or something so that they respect me in return
actually i like to be respected and to be respected is not because i dress well or because .. actually maybe for example because i talk to people, for example i interact with people in a good way or something so people respect me back
no no it's very easy that i can tell the story of my life to any passerby in the street actually
actually if i deal .. deal with somebody that i know that his background for example .. his educational background is different from my educational background yes definitely i .. only i want to change my way so as .. not to annoy him
actually of course for example i deal with .. with somebody actually .. actually from a lower social standard okay so i want to change y way in order not to .. to let him the difference
and no i have never .. actually .. actually .. definitely if somebody did something wrong to me okay, i can .. can respond according to what he did and i know that his way is like that that's why i am okay to deal with him in the same way
actually the usage of english is that i kept using the conjunctions and .. yes okay
actually it's .. actually it happens .. it actually like a project or something for example sometimes i am required to do something related to mechatronics for example someone is working in coding, someone is working in hardware and other one is working in electronics
so yes somehow i may not perform some tasks .. that i don't understand exactly so yes actually i will beat around the bush and .. and yes actually i will try to make the conversation longer until the one in front of me gets bored and actually .. i may reach his point .. for example i may reach the limit that he wants me to explain
no no absolutely actually sometimes i get up at night to check the .. the mobile actually i have .. the phobia of checking my mobile to make sure that nobody calls me then i will go back to sleep
it's not a good thing in general and it causes headache to me for example sometimes i don't do anything so i .. i forgot everything and i kept using it
and this is .. actually not good and sometimes it causes me headaches and sometimes i go and ask my mother to take my mobile and not to give it back to me, if somebody is trying to call me, i don't want to answer i had a headache, i don't want to answer
okay i will persuade you that .. it's better to continue your education abroad outside egypt
actually maybe for example there are some parents refused to let their children study abroad .. and so on actually they should persuade their parents that they didn't spend all these years learning and at the end they are asked to put a limit to their ambitions.
actually i .. i should .. try and each person has to have his own life experience
actually for example when someone you know like your cousin for example gives you a negative feedback about life abroad saying that people there are not good
no you should go and try this on your own to discover how life is not suitable for you
you'll go there according to your background and your specific expectations so you will feel that .. that .. that actually you reach your goal and .. and that if it really meets your expectations that you thought of before coming or not
so ..  actually you cannot remain in your place because .. your parents wanted you to be there
after that .. you'll discover that time flies and you did what they want and not what you want and .. and at that time you'll feel that your life is boring and you would blame yourself for not doing so? at that time you will be old enough that you have no time to regret what you did
and your life will be based on routine and it will be constant and you kept thinking that you should have done something and you didn't and this won't change anything
i was born in cairo and when i was in the .. primary stage, i went to .. to a private school and we used to learn arabic and english
i couldn't .. couldn't afford to continue learning at a private school so i went to public schools in the preparatory and secondary stages
but definitely i studied everything in arabic in the preparatory and secondary stages
basically i joined computer science and my .. my major is all about information systems that we use to .. to analyze data, the retrieval and the storage and so on
and why did i choose computer science?
basically because i liked using computers since i was young
but at home they told me that i have two choices either i can be a computer scientist for example or to teach because i used to love teaching when i was young so i had to go for any of these choices
my bachelor project was like a mobile application that i created to simulate the behavior of the google pay and .. and apple that is i pay as well
we wanted to create a universal application where you insert all your cards whether they are debit card, credit card or affiliation card that has to do with a specific organization or something and you used them instead of getting them out from your bag as you can just use them throughout the mobile
actually we wanted to have this idea as it's .. is already there but we wanted to collect everything and put it in one place only which is not apple, actually apple pay support some options and don't support the other no e wanted to support everything
okay my daily routine is not different from the traditional daily routine that anyone has
basically i get up and check my schedule at work then i get dressed and go to work
i don't get coffee like other people do and this is totally different from other people
that's it, and afterwards i check the tutorials that i should finish or the correction or meetings or things of the sort or if there's something to work on in research, an experiment or so and that's it
yes basically my favorite hobby is to discover new music because i really love songs, so i sit by myself and open anghami or something to listen to songs, if i like it, i get it, if not, i will check another one
i will tell you basically when i was young, i used to listen to arabic songs rather than english songs, when i grew up, i did the opposite as i listen to english songs rather than arabic songs
yes i have a lot of favorite songs
for example michael jackson is one of my favorite but he died, and now ariana grande is my favorite as well and that's it
any pop music singers but they should be good
yes it's been a long time since i last watched a movie
i will tell you  the last movie i watched at the cinema was the glass
that was the last movie i watched at the cinema basically
it was about the idea of somebody who predicts that some people have supernatural potentials such as those who read the minds and those who did something else and he gathered them in a storyline
and at the end he wanted them to take the same path and he wanted to put them in a team but he failed at the end
if the idea of experimental schools is still there that they are public schools but at the same time they teach english and arabic, but most of the subjects are in english, i would go for such schools
if this system is canceled, because i know that they are against it and they want to cancel it, in this case, i have to enroll them in private schools and the .. the main language there is english and then the other language is arabic
unfortunately, all the fields of science is taught in english, so if they don't know it, they won't be able to do research and won't be able to study, they can't produce anything
my dream job was teaching since i was young
i used to love to teach when i was young
i used to bring all my relatives and let them sit in front of me and i kept explaining some topics to them
if i weren't a teacher, basically i would .. would study space science
but i didn't find it in egypt, and when i found it, i found something called a meteorological organization and things like that
so they told me that i will do researches on the weather so i told them that this is not my ambition
i wanted to do more than this
so this is my dream job, it's somehow related to space science
but currently my dream job is to work in the software engineering that i should not only do the coding but i also collect the requirements and check the diagrams for example and to see the user stories and things like that
basically i didn't attend any internships but i would love to but i was not accepted in any place, i don't know why although they accepted applicants with lower gpas than mine
but the idea is that they don't target the gpa maybe they target another aspects
i don't know what it is honestly
okay, now after working, do you prefer working life or university life when you were a student and you have no responsibilities at that time but also you have to study and so on?
no definitely i would say university life because basically when i was at university there was a well structured program
for example, say i was required that i will study one, two, three, four, you will get the grade, then you will succeed and that's it
but now, i am doing the opposite, as i restructure the things then let people follow me and then succeed by the end
definitely doing something from scratch is more difficult than following a ready-made system.
okay can you tell us about the last place that you have visited in egypt and what place influence you the most?
basically i am not the person you mean because i don't like traveling and i hate to make a lot of movements
actually i am that kind of person who loves to settle in a place, i don't like to move a lot.
but basically it's been a very long time since i last traveled, it's been five years since i last traveled abroad.
i was in the states so .. so what? yes what i have seen there was different from what's here in egypt
but what influenced me there is the downtown there as it looked very nice, and there was .. was .. was something like an arena where they watch their matches of wwa that is wrestling and so on and i love this
so i hoped to attend such events
but i saw it from outside it was wow and the arena was huge
i will say basically actually, the question is actually  i will say, basically i have no problem with egypt as a country. my problem is with .. with the mentality as not all .. all people are the same or most of the people that live outside egypt, the problem is in their mentality
actually they misunderstand the people surround them
or that we have for example a high level of authority, so you should follow us and if they didn't do this, we will get into debates or things like that
actually if .. if we removed those bad people and replaced them with better people, i would be happy
i will tell you, basically yes and i am in a state of mind like that, for example, i stayed for two .. or three years at university and i search example and i .. i study for example and i give tutorials and that's it so this is the point and so what? what's next? would i continue this or not? for example i can go for a scholarship as dalia told me or not?
i am in a state of mind and something like that and i don't know where i am? or what am i going to do?
so actually i'm in a middle of a turning point
okay do you feel that this turning point is changing your personality? or your personality doesn't change but you change your way of thinking so what will you do now?
it changes my way of thinking of course but it won't change my personality, because this is not that turning point that will change my personality a lot no but it changes my state for example it can take me to a better or a worse place, it depends on my thought
okay, good when you were a student or a ta, do you prefer working in a team or .. or working individually to handle the project and everything on your own?
i will tell you, when i was a student, i used to work individually, and .. but i have trust issues
actually i don't trust anyone easily
for example, i know that his performance at work is not got or that he will cause problems, so i won't work with him
so most of the times yes i was making teams for the sake of making a team but at the end i was doing everything individually and we pass the evaluation because i explain to everyone what they should do
at university as a ta, if i work in the course individually, i definitely prefer working in the course individually because of the organization so .. so it will be only one, so as not to have any miscommunication or something
and if i will work with another ta, it depends on the trust, my level
so yes for example i worked with people that i trust them greatly and i worked with other people that caused problems
yes there is, but we said that we will not mention name so of course there's
no they are professors here at university
no, a lot of things. actually, there's a specific example as i like everything he does
no actually the presentation skills that he has
the way that he knows how to deliver the correct info to people
his way of thinking or his logical thinking? do i get it?
liked or respected? okay .. if people like, they will definitely respect you at some point .. some point
i prefer to be liked rather than respected because at the end, if you like me, you can respect me somehow
okay, do you feel that you are an easy person to talk with at the beginning? or they take time to break the ice?
on the contrary, i am the one who takes time to adapt with people, as anybody can adapt with me but i cannot adapt with anyone at once
okay do you find it difficult to deal with people from a different social level whether it's higher or lower? do you need to change your way of speaking, your attitude in general when you deal with social levels and so on?
i will tell what's supposed to happen
you're supposed to change your spee .. your speech based on which level you are talking with whether it's higher or lower than yours
but i don't know how to this
and that may cause some problems
so i like to avoid dealing with someone who is higher or lower than me
but if i had to do so, i will respect those who are lower, but sometimes this backfire me
sometimes he thinks that i underestimate him or something
on the contrary, when i call him sir or something, he considered that i am showing arrogance but i don't mean this at all
i will tell you, the best trait i have is that i like being helpful
actually i wish not to change this trait whatsoever actually
if he is a liar
i cannot deal with him at all
i have never done this actually, but as for the evaluation i like when i talk about something, i should understand what i am talking about
if i don't understand this .. i will tell you that i don't understand or i can ask about what you mean
honestly i was not saying nonsense, but i have never been in this situation
i have never .. i always like to be ready and efficient enough
i don't like to be a situation like that
if .. if you .. if you will remove the applications yes maybe, but if i .. i will use it to talk to people, maybe i need somebody for example, so actually no.
okay as for the last question, can you choose anything you want and persuade us of for example .. you can persuade us to complete master's, to travel abroad, or not to travel abroad, or anything .. anything that you are persuaded of to let us be persuaded
yes sure, first of all i was born in alexandria
i went to a national school until i became in .. in middle three, so i went to an ig or pre-ig, but after that i continued four years in an ig school
after finishing the ig, i used to focus mainly on fields like mathematics, physics or ict because at the that time i thought of joining computer science or anything related to it field
after finishing school, i went to cairo, joined the university of cairo and i did majoring in computer science as i wished to do this, but it was definitely computer engineering because there's not computer science in that university
and now i graduated and became an engineer, it's mentioned in my id that i am a free electrical engineer and i'm teaching as a teaching assistant hardware courses
it was mainly english and arabic, but there was french at the beginning
yes my bachelor was titled gamifying physiotherapy and android wearable game for adolescent patients, a very long title
basically it was about serious games with hci
there were kids, or in general there were kids having problems with their muscles, they can't move their hands or their wrest and so on, so we was trying to teach them their physiotherapy exercises in a fun and interactive way, gamified
there was a smart wearable that detects the movements of the child
and there's mainly a game that was mine, it was called music chasers and it's all about a song and song was being played as long as he made the once right movements, if he made a wrong movement, the song would be paused and he should continue doing the right movement so as not to stop the song
so mainly it's that he exercises or do his physiotherapy exercises
and instead of going to a certain institute to get treatment or something and even in the countryside where they don't have hospitals or take a long time to go to a hospital, so no using android device and smart wearables enables him to do exercises at home
so mainly this semester is because .. i have a lot of tasks in the first slot so i get up early
actually i get up at 7 am or 7:30 am
i already live near to university actually, in the same area, so i don't have to get up too early and actually i have my own car, so i have no problem
i get up, have breakfast, go to university and check if i have teaching, i have correction like midterms, finals or quizzes, i have content preparation for the coming weeks
after going home, i call my friends to hang out to watch the matches like champion league for example or we can play soccer and son then i sleep and that's it
mainly in the weekends, i like to meet my friends on friday in the morning until it's 4 o'clock for example
we usually have the tradition of playing soccer on saturday at night at one of the schools, in that area
so actually maybe because i don't have long weekend in this semester because i have teaching first on saturday, so i have to prepare the content on friday because i have teaching on wednesday fifth actually so my weekend in this semester is thursday and friday
actually i have a break on thursday and on friday i prepare, i have first teaching actually
somehow
i'm pretty sure it's english because i already hate the arabic literature
i don't remember exactly the last book but everything was almost academic, it's related to master's anyways
the last movie i watched at the cinema was captain marvel
i was very anticipating to see what's going to happen in avengers end game and the build up of avengers end game, so i went to watch it at the cinema
yes actually expectations versus reality, the movie wasn't that
but now actually he completed the missing part of the marvel cinematic universe
maybe because i was in the ig in an international, i definitely support the international education system
although the governments are making improvements
but also i believe that they are my children as they are supposed to receive the best education provided by international institutes and international curriculum
i will tell you, basically, the first thing for example how i became a ta?
i wanted to complete the master's and also at the same time i want to work in the industry
so actually my dream goal or my dream job is to travel abroad, and to go to one of the tag giants in usa
i used to travel there, and at the same time, i wanted to work in the research and development
the r and d the parts that develop and their things, they do research behind the applications and the software and the hardware and so on
but actually i'm dreaming of pursuing a master's in egypt and a phd abroad, i don't work in the academic field as in teaching would be my main focus or my main role, but to work in industry as research and development
as internships or as a student, i used to work in two companies in three months
i worked for a month in the first company and i worked for two months in the second company
both companies have nothing to do with development, they were just it, technical support or maintenance
it was a good experience as i didn't study this at university, but actually we have work and people are interested in this
after that, after i had finished the internships, i became a ta
actually people are surprised especially my friends as i didn't really like hardware courses and actually i'm not into hardware, yet the two courses that i teach are hardware courses because for me hardware is actually easy teaching-wise .. or i find it easy i mean
maybe it's not the best thing or the most enjoyable thing, but after i taught the hardware courses no i felt that they are good but i'm interested in them, although my master's are not hardware, and actually i will not ever focus on mastering or phd in hardware
because definitely it's full of a lot of technical details and i was not the cleverest one in physics and so on
but no actually i am glad and i have no problem
all my colleagues in the office and all the tas said that they wished to be students again studying and so on is better that working as tas
i am the only one who says no, working as tas is the best, it's not the best career as a ta but the best thing is that i don't study, i wouldn't have final exam and i should study for it, i don't have projects, no maybe it's .. a little bit flexible
but as for me i study a certain course to teach it, but no i see that working life is better than being a student
no i have never traveled abroad
inside egypt? a place that i like?
actually technically i am not .. not .. not into egypt that much, but at that time when i was living in alexandria, what i really liked was when i went to cairo and saw the egyptian museum and the pharaonic monuments and so on
to me alexandria as a coastal city, as we used to sit by the beach and even the north coast and so on, things like that, and even the monuments there were more into roman, like romanian and greek monuments
when i saw the origin of the pharaonic civilization such as the pyramids, the sphinx and so on, no actually i felt that egypt has a great heritage
it was somehow interesting
as i told in the beginning, my dream is to travel to europe or the us, i pursue my phd degree, and after that i will work there and settle in one of the tech giants, so definitely i'll accept it
mainly, when i participated in student activities at university especially my last two years
no my way of thinking started to change
the community was different as they started to shape actually the new friends that i made or the new friendship that i used to make that i started to .. to shape and it influenced me especially when i see my friends for example say what they want to do when they grow up
no i felt that i can change my vision of life
but no actually i was determined when i was at school to join computer science and i joined computer science
maybe in the last few years i dreamed to be a ta but not because ta is good, but because i want complete master's and i want to make phd and to continue this track
no i find what i wanted in my life so it's achieved. no i feel that actually that such ambitions that i have already wished are being achieved
it depends on the projects
actually for example the game for instance, i told my partner that i will do it all on my own
it was very interesting
it was yugi-oh and i used to love yugi from the childhood memories
i told him that i don't need his help and that i will work on the whole project on my own
thank god i got a plus at the end and we finalized everything
no it .. it was a good project honestly
so that was a type of project i like to work on individually
there are some other projects that we should divide the tasks as each one will be responsible for his tasks and so on because they are projects mega projects big projects
they require multiple people to work on
it's a difficult question honestly
basically when a person feels down, does he actually say it's okay i don't care about the grade whether it's five percent, ten percent, percent fifteen percent for project the project?
so actually it's okay what's important is what grade we will get
but no by the end actually  as motivation-wise, we kept working on the project for example before it we could go and watched a match for example, actually there motivational boosters to get us more motivated
we can have a break for some time without working on the project, we go to the cinema, actually
no i don't have for example .. i don't have a role model in all fields, i have only one
but no i have a role model in a specific field that i want to achieve a goal that he has already achieved
for example for example when it comes to technology, steve jobs is my role model for example
when it comes to soccer actually i prefer for example somebody like abu trika or mohamed salah as role models
but i don't have the specific role model in general
liked or respected?
i guess respected
why?
because actually if people respect you, eventually they .. will like you
but maybe at the beginning they fear so they respect you for example or maybe they are fear or something
but after that, once they get to know you better, especially that you treat him with respect and so on, so maybe eventually you may like each other or there might be likelihood or whatever
no it's okay i have no problem at all, actually i love to get to know people actually, i am very sociable in this part
no actually for example they can get to know me in a very short time actually
i don't .. don't take time to get to know people
social level as in what actually?
as an education-wise actually definitely for example in general if i speak with code-switching, i .. i .. i switch from arabic into english for example a lot of my speech, no for example i choose for example if i am in a taxi or any transportation, of course i won't speak with him in english in .. such context
so i had to speak using .. terminologies that he understands
i am dreamy and i like to imagine how my future will look like
if he doesn't respect other people or he keeps bullying them
and things like that
i have a deadline for example and i haven't even started yet
this .. this is mainly stress
but they aren't deadlines projects and so on, no they are deadlines in my life in general, for example for example such as submitting your military status documents, urgent things that are really important to your future and you can lose everything if you don't do it
maybe i became stressed over a presentation for example work or interview or work, and so on as my career, my life depends on passing this interview or this presentation, so no i am stressed
but if i am well-prepared, it's okay stress will go away
i kept asking you about the functions of the anode and cathode
it could be .. no i did do this in the bachelor presentation
the seminar no maybe even the seminar presentation also as its topics included terminologies that we didn't understand such terminologies
because in the seminar, he gave you papers to read and to present those papers
so you don't understand it, you just say as it is with its terminology and that's it actually
but no, but actually most probably no i didn't use sophisticated .. words before because i didn't understand
i never had something like that
no
because basically the mobile is now connected to everything either it has social network, your friends, chats, and so on
of course some people are trying to get away from the mobile and so on, but no i feel that my life is related to it as i should check for example my newsfeed, i check for example instagram, check twitter, check the news
even for example i want to call somebody for example even phone call it's necessarily to be texting
no the mobile should be essential for each individual in the world
you remind me of black mirror
so technically the episodes of black mirror tackle how can technology go wrong
so okay yes communication-wise the situation was much better before, people sit face to face and they communicate, now people can just send texts and even short messages
but eventually now you can talk to somebody in another country, somebody in another continent, it becomes much easier to talk with him instead of traveling, so this makes him closer
but definitely actually it's like a weapon with two edges, actually it could be bad, or it could be good, but i see that its advantages are more than its disadvantages
no it's .. it's difficult to persuade you to ..
should i persuade you to do something?
okay
definitely actually last year there were so many people asking us what's the importance of embedded systems course in our life?
and we as dmet especially met why do we study hardware in such level, and that we implement wiring parts?
and people already hate the wiring from project circuit two to project dsd
and why do we deal with hardware?
i like to tell you people that those who are in mechatronics wish to take this embedded course
that you take course that mechatronics department don't take
while mechatronics have to take a diploma to be able to pass the test
and you have like fifty, sixty, seventy percent of the content of the test, there's only one small part missing
so actually you could be hardware engineers and to make money and be rich
i was born in cairo
i lived here in egypt until i was in grade six i went to .. school
i went to a school in eltayran street
i live in nasr city, abbas elaakad
i were there until i was in grade six
after grade 6 i traveled to emirates
i used to stay in .. in el ain
i went to an american school
i graduated in two thousand and fifteen
then i joined this university engineering mechatronics
why did i choose mechatronics?
because i love working in the field of industry
and at the same time i hate theoretical materials
i always like practical work
and i will persuade you by the end
okay
but
as i told you i love practical work
at the beginning we used to study the materials of physics, math, and chemistry that we used to study in the general secondary
but they weren't the best for me
i didn't start to like the .. the major itself as mechatronics except in semester five maybe
because i started to find what i was studying in physics and math and i started to see it
i started to see it, i mean that i started to apply what i studied
my bachelor project mainly focused on the field that we didn't study at university especially it's optics
and the optics in the .. the coming, actually the sensors that we are using now are no longer the best
so my project is about the sensors that monitor cancer cells
i get up at 6 am
exactly an hour and i take the bus at 7 o'clock, the bus arrives university at eight to fifteen o'clock
the day starts from 8 o'clock until 6 o'clock by maximum
no, i don't like reading at all.
the movie life of pi
this movie is about an indian boy
this indian boy  he had a zoo in india, and decided to immigrate taking with him all the animals
he immigrated by the ship, that's it
and when they were on the ship, the ship sank
nothing remained on the ship except the boy pi and the tiger
he didn't discover that that the tiger is alive until he took a boat trying to survive then he found the tiger came from the ship
that's it, he was in water all that time, he was trying to survive, how to eat, how to drink, how he .., he sailed by boat until he reached the shore
that's it
there's no .. no specific singer that i love to listen to, on the contrary i listen to everything
i don't always care about the lyrics as much as i care about the rhythm and the music itself
before i start thinking of mechatronics, i hoped to join aeronautical engineering
but our problem is that aeronautical engineering is found in cairo university only
and this is very difficult to me
but the second option for me is mechatronics
so as for my dream job, i wanted to join mechatronics in the aeronautical engineering
okay well, can you tell us about the internships that you attended or the full-time or part-time jobs that you had when you were at university?
i have never had any jobs whether they are part-time or full-time
but i attended only one internship in summer in a car factory
that's it
it was for a month
we used to watch the assembly line of cars, the stages of collecting the automotive parts, the stages of painting
i don't like anything theoretical
i haven't started to enjoy the .. the major until i started working on the bachelor
and actually i learned topics hundred times more than what i learned in the seven semesters
i used to live in emirates so .. regardless of emirates, i have never been to anywhere else
sharm elsheikh
i liked the landscapes there, staying .. at the hotel without any responsibilities, without anything else, it's only relaxation
definitely for me, if i found that it won't make any difference and that it's like staying here, no definitely i will stay in my homeland
if this difference is significant, yes i have no problem to make this decision to live abroad
on the contrary, i will deal with a new culture, new people, a totally new different life, so i like this
at first as i told you, in the first semesters at university, it was totally theoretical for me, as we used to solve mathematics equations, i didn't want this
but at the same time there weren't anything else or the other major will not be related to this at first
so to me the best choice is to continue and wait
actually for me, i made a car accident, before this, i was very reckless, but after that, i started to .. to take everything into account before doing it, and that's it
the .. the group work has its advantage and the single work has another advantage
in the group work, you collect ideas from many people. so as a result the probability to get the best result is big
but when i work alone, i will be secured about the .. the quality that is a result of my work
the implementation of the idea itself differs
like we can summarize this in the idiom that says, too .. too many cooks spoil the broth
my father
to me he has a very big responsibility
i didn't find this in any other father, anyways
but to me he is the perfect model actually i do like him
i don't mean that i do the same as he did, no the way he deals with people, his attitude, his mentality
i like to imitate him
being liked is that i change myself to be .. be liked, and the same happens with the other person
i will keep changing because i won't be liked by everyone at once
in order to be liked by someone .. i will change for this reason, then i will change for the sake of the other person
but to be respected, i .. i will be the only one, that's it
so whoever likes me .. should like me as i am, and this is .. is respect and he will deal with me based on this respect, i won't need to change myself for him
i hate to deal with that kind of person who thinks that he is the smartest man in the world
there's not a smartest one in the world
on the contrary i will to deal with the one who accept the other, it could be a good idea but at the same time, it could be bad
personally, i can find both good and bad ideas
but i hate the one who thinks that he's the smartest person in the world, because he is very arrogant, in a higher level he started saying wrong ideas just because he believes that he is the best
reckless
i was always reckless in the decisions i made, and sometimes in my reactions
but now i am trying to stop being reckless, and to stop my spontaneous reactions
i kept thinking before doing anything or taking any action towards anything
naturally i have a different taste
and mostly moody
and i don't .. don't give the chance to anyone who deals with me because i know that he won't like this
unless i stayed with him for a period of time, we are trying to discover one another
we understood each other we are on the same track we started .. started to get to know him more and i started to deal with him more, and as a result he can get closer to me actually, that's it
no not at all, on the contrary the community that surrounds me, i feel that we are all the same level
i have to problem to deal with them
this has to do with university
outside university, of course you interact with other people
i can deal with workers, engineers, doctors, the way i deal with each person differs. so i should .. see who i deal with, and i start to deal with him in the same way
if i study and memorize, memorize memorize for the exam okay what should i do after the exam? nothing
when i finish the exam and realize that i forgot something, like when i wanted to remember something that i have studied in the previous semester, i couldn't remember it at some time, so i started to feel that i'm stressed
so what it is
where i can find the information, or the part .. part that i know, where i can found it
okay later on, who will tell me this or will teach us this
okay .. actually did it happen before when you were in an evaluation at university or any other situation when you were asked a topic that you didn't understand, so you had to speak in english or mention very difficult expressions in order to .. skip the meeting and that's all, and the one in front of you says that you really understand, so the situation would pass
no, on the contrary i am very cautious in such situations even .. even if i am vague in my speech, that the one in front of me can understand clearly what i say because if he doesn't understand, i will make it more clear for him; otherwise it will be misunderstood
okay if it's wrong, what will happen next?
no i hate being in such level, i prefer being clear and honest in everything
or i i want to reach a certain point, i reach this point and keep repeating it until it becomes clear
can we live without a mobile and why?
i like isolation, so maybe, actually i can live without a mobile for a certain period of time
but when i reach at some point that i want to call somebody, i want to express something, so no i will need it
anything i want
pause
you'll see how this will take us, let's go
i can persuade you that mechatronics are more important than met
because in met, they code
or according to what i understand they code that's it
as for mechatronics, we code, connect electricity, connect mechanisms
so if we said that .. that met can the same tasks of mechatronics, no. but mechatronics can do the tasks of met
so as a result mechatronics is more important
okay, okay, what you have said is relatively right but .. i won't say that mechatronics is not important, mechatronics are very important, because they have their work but at some point when you code, you'll reach a point where you cannot continue
as for mechatronics, it doesn't need the complexity of coding that they use at work or in computer science or met in general
as for mechatronics, the .. the part of code is what they use, it's the mostly used part, he know it very well
i don't need more
on the contrary, besides he knows electricity, knows mechanics
as for met, he can sit in front of a robot, and just write the code
okay how this code reacts, how it works
okay why it didn't work?
how electricity is connected to it, and so on, he cannot do this
exactly, sure
but this doesn't mean that this is more important than the other
okay should i tell you my age?
no it's not necessary
i went to  national français school then i joined an international  university
i joined mass communication
that's why when i graduated from university i came back here again
now i am working at another university which is international as well but it has nothing to do with my university as they have radio tv  department and this department has a channel where i am working at . i am working as a presenter and i am here with you
okay, i .. was at mass communication, of course i was at the department of radio and television .
i like so much something called mic, that's why i am very happy that you are talking with me  .
. my graduation project was about the effect of pictures in people's life.
we have met many different people, one is old aged, other is younger and other in the mid age, so, to take the experience we have done many interviews and we took many photos and we started to do something like an intro in the beginning, talking about the impact of each photo on the people's life.
we took photos for those persons who are graduated.
for those who are playing a game, we think how to make the photo can leave an important memory on people's life.
that was my graduation project.
i was hoping and it was my dream job to be a presenter, until i got the chance and the opportunity to work at the channel in the university .. the one which i am working there till now  .
okay in the weekdays, i wake up in the morning, taking my breakfast and then, go to the work. after work, i go to the gym and then see if i have something important to do or not, if not, then, i go outside to spend a time with my friends.
that is happening in the weekdays.
in the weekend, i must have a vacation and travel anywhere even if it is for two days only. in winter, i don't travel anywhere, it is only gym or go out with my friends.
i like swimming and dancing very much, i like riding horses as well, but, actually it is very rare to practice riding it a lot.
yes, but i don't read a lot.
look, the last book
no, not the last book, but, we can say that the book which really touched me was a very different book, it is not related to increasing knowledge or information, it is a book called "hebta", i think you will find many people know it, i felt it is a book talking about real life.
it is not the best book, but, it touched me personally. i am not going to tell you a quote from this book, but, i will tell you my favorite quote which i usually follow through all my life, it said " believe you can and you're half way there".
the story of the last movie i watched.
it was at the cinema, it was an arabic film actually, not english, it is called "men's secret club"
, tell you? the story.
okay, in general, it was talking that people were different there. my friends told me to go and watch it, because they told me the boys are very very bad, and look what they are doing. look, finally the goal of this movie that boys are having their own world.
my personal opinion is how a girl can deal with boys without losing herself, and let the boy thinks by another way, and at the same time girls must think and put plans  .
very much, i like listening to songs very much.
no, i like anything, arabic and english, and any type of song, there isn't a certain type of songs.
i listen to sad songs, but, i don't like to hear this type of songs a lot as it can depress me, do you understand?  .
during the time of university, i was at something called .. do you want me to say its name? okay, there was something related to the stock exchange, but, i was responsible for the media department there.
there was another thing, yes, it was a charity, i was the one responsible for the charity there.
we were helping people from .. from inside the university, the university became to have a role.
there was another thing, it was entertainment, those 3 things together, those were things i liked mostly. when, i was at school, there wasn't anything from these.
look, i am here at the .. at the channel of this university, i am the presenter.
look, since i was a child, my dream job was to be a presenter, so, if i didn't take the chance to work there, i would .. actually i was asking anyone about a job, i.e. to have a job.
that was really.
so, till i came here, yes, i am working with the university, but, in another online channel not related to the university, so, still more than 1 person tell me that it is very difficult and it is better to leave this job, but, it is difficult to find another, then, i insist on the .. that's why here or there it will be my dream job.
i have taken my internship in berlin from a very short time.
it was something related to the social media, but mostly fashion, they said as i am the presenter so, of course i will have a background about fashion and style, so, i can help.
it was for two to three weeks only and returned back.
look, every stage has its own positive points, i miss those days. when i was a student i was enjoying my life, i was sleeping or going outside at any time, but, now i feel with more stress.
at the time when i was a student, i was feeling with stress, but, now i know that stress is much more.
you think you want to get old, want to be better, think what the next step is.
this is good and that's good, but, of course what i am in is good as well.
yes, i traveled to paris before, but, it was a from a very long time.
i traveled to berlin as well, more than 1 time.
i traveled to italy.
mostly were outings.
i traveled to malaysia because one of my relatives is from malaysia, that's why i went there.
i traveled to thailand.
every place has its own culture, so, it is something good to know different and new things.
look, thailand is the most different culture from us and from any other culture, because in thailand, the religion is buddhism., it is a very different religion.
the ..  the food was awful  .
actually, i didn't find anything i can eat there.
they are eating insects and uncooked food.
in malaysia, it was a little bit asian, yes, it was similar to it, but in malaysia is a country which has foreigners and it has everything you need. so, everything has .. has the .. things known by its country, every country has its own culture.
of course europe is something completely different.
we are talking on something completely different.
maybe what makes asia different, that it has many activities like swimming with an elephant, or anything related to fun.
but, europe known by its high urbanization.
venice and milano, why? because.
why? because,  venice it is an extremely good country, the idea that the way of your transportation is by using something like a small boat, makes you feel that everything is going with ease and lightness. actually you can feel with a great elegance.
and milano, because it is known by fashion, and i adore something called fashion, there is an elegance in the .. in the .. in the .. way of walking, not the way to wear the clothes, but, in the way of walking itself.
that is me, this is as my personality.
no. at first, i will think, because it will depend on the job, what it will be this bob, if it is something i like or not? what is he language used?
so, if it is paris, i will tell you okay, because i was learning french at the school time.
but, still, what will be the job?
am i going to like this job or not?
is is it good or not?
is it .. is it going to suit me or am i going to switch and change the career?
all of these are going to make a difference with me, if i am going to agree or not.
traveled  .
not too much as well.
there are many things i don't know.
i went before to luxor and aswan.
i want to go to dahab, i never went there.
i went before to alexandria, and all these .. known places.
but, it was too many here in egypt.  .
and of course i went to fayoum before.
but, i didn't go to many places here in cairo.
from 2 years ago, i had a big accident.
i lost memory for we can say two or three days.
days i don't remember at all.
and the accident was not here in cairo, it happened in another governorate.
, i can't remember, there are many details as well i can't remember, but, i heard and i knew that i was almost near to lose my life in a second.
i was receiving a treatment for 4 months, i was having many injuries in my body result from this accident.
in every place in my body.
without telling you details.
but, after i knew that i lost memory and i knew that it was for two three days it is a short time, so, i found that i am still able to remember any old memories except the details of the accident, that's why i asked myself why am i feeling upset? there is nothing to make me feel upset.
from that time of the accident, my way of thinking changed. for example: if there is something happened that might annoy me, so, i will take the decision to think if it is something deserves to get upset on it or not. the same, if lost a job or i argued with someone, because there are other important things to thin about.
look, both are good, but, sometimes i think if i am going to work with a team so, i will depend on them, and i may not work, but, if i am going to work by myself, then, i will work more and faster.  .
i usually encourage and motivate.
i am from the persons who usually gives motivation to people.
i have to encourage and give motivation and start by saying that if we are not going to do x, then, what can we do, trying to save what is remained  .
of course my manager, and if we are talking about someone outside the university, then, it will be of course my father and my mother.
of course because they are the ones who are usually motivate and encourage me on everything in my life whether a job, relation or anything in my life.
they are the most persons who can support me, even in the worst situations.  .
respected, because if people .. if they respect you, they will be already .. already liked from .. from all the people, but, if you are liked, then, it is not a condition to be respected.
you can be liked because of .. your look, something good you did, but, not for your personality.
no, it is a little bit easy, because i always like to spend time at home, actually i am not very sociable with people.
if it is less, no.
if it is too much, so, i .. i find myself can't deal very much.
i feel they are different.
i feel they are in attitude where i can't be fake because there is too much fakeness.
look, it is something i like and don't like at the same time in my personality, that i am very kind with the people, and that is something .. good and bad at the same time.
why is it good?
why is it good? because i can't leave a person who needs a help from me without supporting him/her.
i, it is must be me .. it is not .. it is not something mandatory, but, i like to help, i like to work, i like to talk, i like to stand, i like like like, but, at the same time, there is a point i reach where i feel that i stressed on myself.
you are kind, so, there is no problem if we stressed on her.
lying.
sometimes i feel i am cool.  .
something weird?
look, there is something i usually do, but it is slightly weird, for example: if i bought any earring, whatever it is, there is right side and left side, so, i have to wear the right piece in the right side, and the left piece on the right side, and it must be returned, and if this not happened, then, it will be one of the big problems.
if i knew that the person who is talking in front of me is lying, so, this .. this stressed me and i feel that i can't prove the oppposite.
acting  .
yes , i usually do this.
i usually interfere different topics together to show my qualifications, that i have x, y, z  .
look, if i am talking with a close person, then, she will know that i am telling her fake things, but, if i talked with someone not close to me, she would get impressed with my way in thinking, and that is not real.  .
no, impossible.
all my life depends on it.
i have whatsapp and instagram, actually all my work is on it
i use instagram and social media in general for my work, so, mobile phone is all my life.
okay. i can convince you to do career shift and become presenters.
why to be presenters? because now you if i am going to do an interview you didn't think for example  i while doing this interview with her, is she a presenter or not, and then what?
no.
so, i see that while doing an interview with me, you put a great confidence in yourself.
arranged your questions.
you did a script or both of you did a very good script.
you talked with a very organized way to prove yourselves as presenters.
therefore, this makes me see that the question was arranged, everything was going organized, and the script itself was prepared, actually all the ideas are ready.
so, this makes me feel convinced that you can be presenters.
so, this can make you ask yourselves, why am i not be a presenter?
i succeeded in .. in the .. in the thing i am doing, and in asking her the questions and she answered all the questions, and we didn't feel that she lost, but on the other hand i found that everything was going smoothly and arranged, and that of course will let you feel self confidence to become presenters.
it is not related to the certificate at all.
yes, i am a masscom graduate, but all .. half the number of the people .. half the number of people who work in this field
the talent and self confidence.
if you felt with a high self confidence, then, this will help to let you become a presenter.  .
i am from alexandria.
my background is i was at national school, english only.
i went to the university .. faculty of engineering, i already took the decision to go to the faculty of engineering.
in the beginning, i took the decision to go to mechatronics and then i took the decision to switch to another department.
by studying, i liked computer engineering in general, computer science as programming in specific.
so, i shifted .. i shifted the major, and i decided to study computer science. later on, i decided to shift the major once again, i decided to change and study another subjects in computer science, because i liked to study these subjects.
that's it .. that happened at the 2nd year .. the decision .. i took the decision from the 2nd year at university, but actually after the first term i felt i need to change and shift to another section.
what are we studying in computer science?
okay. it is mainly programming and then we have studied theoretical subjects related to computer and computer programming. and then, we studied things related to signals audio video processing and image processing.
and mainly this is what we have taken and studied or we can say this is what at least i enjoyed or cared to study.
moreover, there were courses about course hardware, but, i didn't enjoy or care studying it.
my bachelor project was talking about hci and machine learning and image processing all together. it was a facial emotion recognition, and it wasn't here in egypt, it was at a university in germany in stuttgart.
i have worked on this project, doing research for 3 months and implementation for another 3 months and that's it.
that .. that's what i remember about my project.
and by the end of this project, we got output only.
oh  later on, i decided to continue my study and do masters as long as i liked the academic field because i liked doing research and reading papers. in general, research is even more important than the idea of teaching itself.
i liked the academic field very much because i felt with the creativity, and everyday i read and learn new things and i can shift the field easily, without doing any modularity things.
my daily routine, when i wake up in the morning, i take a shower and go to the work, except at the weekends, so, i .. go to my work.
if i had time, i would drink coffee, and then start my work, if not, then, i start my work and during a free time i bring a coffee.
but, it is a must to have a coffee in the first 2 hours of my life and then continue my work, and later on after 4 or 5 hours i have coffee as well.
so, we can say that coffee is from the main things at my work, because it helps me to continue working.
but, sometimes i don't take my breakfast. breakfast is not a part from my daily routine. from my routine, once i woke up, it is a must to listen to songs, and these songs affect me positively while working or not.
i always listen to songs,  .. songs help me to concentrate. listening to songs help me to concentrate faster and help me to feel relax.
that's my daily routine .. my routine depends mainly on coffee and music.
i listen more to arabic songs because i like old arabic songs .. i listen to any singer, so, i can't tell you a specific one whom i listen to.
i can tell you a name, but, we can't say that this is the only singer whom i listen to his songs only and all the time, i like to hear many singers .. but mostly, i listen to arabic songs and oriental music. if i got a chance to attend an oriental musical concert, i wouldn't miss this chance and go immediately.
in the weekends, i return back to my family in alexandria, as i am .. i am not from cairo.
a whole day i spend with my friends, at one of our friend's home.
i spend all the day and return back home late at night.
i spend all the saturday with my family and mainly on every saturday there are football games, so on saturday i watch football games and spend the day with my family.
yes, it is included in my day, but, it is not everyday, at least i read a book in a month, and most of the books i read are novels whether arabic or english, there is nothing specific. also, as i like writing, so, reading is very important for me.
no, i don't read books to .. i mean, for me books help me to increase experiences more than taking a specific quote. what attracts me is the story itself, not a certain quote, actually i don't concentrate on quotes while reading a book.
we can say that writing may help me to improve my way in writing, but, this doesn't mean borrow (quotation) any specific part from a book i read before.
okay. there is a book i have read from few months ago, it is not the last book i read, but it is .. it is from the books that influenced me, it is a book for tawfik el hakem called "people of the cave".
it is talking about the story of the "people of the cave" which is almost mentioned in all religions, but, the idea that he wrote it by a different way.
he imagined the characters of the story as if they are real persons we know or they are existing in this era. he started to imagine if those persons woke up and started to see things related to the real world they were already exist in from hundreds or thousands years ago .. i can't remember the number of years .. but the idea is how those persons are going to interact in the 2 eras.
because those persons are going to interact and according to the values they knew, they found everything changed and the society itself changed .. although this new society is the one they hoped to live in, but they found themselves can't adapt and there is a struggle inside them between this is the society they wished to live in before and their disability to adapt this new situation, although they woke up young aged .. without any change.
there is a movie called the perks of being a wallflower.
the movie is good, because it is talking about unsocial (introvert) person who is suffering from some psychological problems.
but, the main idea, i don't care to watch movies talking about unsocial persons.
mostly because .. they mainly focus on stories talking about social problems more than stories talking about introvert (unsocial) persons.
the character in the movie was suffering from a big problem during his high school, and the film showed us how this person started to deal with the situation .. the story itself contains many details.
but, it was a good movie, and its story is written in a book, and i read this book after watched the movie.
musician.
i like music.
i play music a little, but the idea is i like composing and .. and singing as well, but i am not sure if singing likes me as well or not, but at least .. the other things, yes.
so, .. yes, but the problem is, this needs effort and a very long time, and unfortunately we can't take all the things together.
okay. once before i did internship at .. at petroleum company  in a desert in hurghada at the mountains and it was something a little bit weird because it was something like a camp.
people there live like that, they live for 2 to 3 weeks and then, 2 to 3 weeks at their place as a vacation.
it was an experience, it was .. i was living alone by myself, and actually that doesn't matter with me, to accept the idea that i am living alone in a place away from any other people. you are living in a very little place, and that's .. that's all you know about the place you are working in, and it was a little bit weird.
it is not a must to learn something new, i might learn skills like technical work, i don't know how to rate my experience, but all i am sure about is i am not going to live this life, so, i took the decision to not work by this .. by this way or routine, i.e. a place of work and at the same time the place to take a vacation.
maybe it is my life when i was a student, because i didn't feel with the pressure of studying and projects.
pressure is not affecting me a lot.
so .. before, i didn't have responsibilities verses nowadays, i am responsible on myself, although i am living alone by myself, but, before, the responsibilities were not too much like today.
before, i was having the idea that for example: i am not able to do x now, i can do it later, but, now the situation is different, i can't do this and delay doing something, because actually i have many things must be done.
i mean i have to prepare the tutorial .. before, if i didn't study, then, it would affect me by not getting high grades, but nowadays, i have to prepare it because my conscience will not allow me to teach a tutorial without being well prepared, or  to wake up or whatever .
so, anyway, there is a pressure on me regarding things i have to do and rules i have to satisfy, although while i was a student, there were rules, but, it was not a must.
so, i think the .. the student life was less pressure although i can't say that i am feeling upset now.
i am not feeling upset, and at the same time the point of having pressure doesn't make a difference with me .. but i think it was more comfortable for me.
yes, i traveled for 6 months to do my master project.
no, tell me the next question.
okay. the point is in the experience of traveling, the point that i am living alone by myself doesn't matter for me, but at least i learned how to cook by myself.
i wasn't cooking here.
although i am living alone by myself, but, i .. making order for any food.
there, i learned how to cook just because there was a little free time than here.
so, .. this was one of the experiences.
there is something else, but it is something personal, the point is how to adapt myself alone in a place without knowing many people.
how, for example .. the point you know people who are close to you plus while traveling the situation differs, people differ when they traveled and go anywhere else.
and this experience is not only in masters, but also in bachelor and the master.
i think it is the same idea, we are not very far.
the people are very different, i mean you may find someone does something different than what he is doing here, and the oppposite, so, i have seen all the types of people.
so .. that was my personal experience, i learned many things in my life, for example not to expect a lot of expectation, because i found people may change after being far away and traveled. i understood that .. whatever happens is according to the circumstances.
actually there are many places i liked there. there is a place in switzerland called rhine falls, it is a water falls of a river called rhine, and for me it is a very good place.
i was going .. i was going there a lot.
it is not very near to me, but .. in many times i decided to take a day off just only to go there and enjoy the natural views there, to get relaxed.
yes, if i got the chance.
i already have offers.
i think, i will travel just i .. am convinced with the experience found there, it is good.
it is not the idea of just traveling, but it is the point that anything i need is better there.
so, it will be faster, the idea is .. not easier but faster and more efficient.
the biggest turning point in my life is when i took the decision to leave my family in alexandria, and came here to cairo and live by myself to study in the university, so, i think this is a big decision i took, and all my life changed after this decision and even all my relations with all my friends changed, i.e. all my life changed.
it made me independent person, until i reached a point where i can't be dependent anymore.
and i can't live with people, i get used to live alone by myself, so, it is not the easiest thing for me.
i think there are other things i liked as well, and i didn't know before that i like it i had free time so, i decided to try these new things and finally i discovered that i liked them.
all my life time was with my family, so, the point to try something new was difficult to be done, but, now i am feeling free, i can go anywhere and return at anytime, and i don't have to do something on certain time.
i liked to work in teams, even if the teams are not going to work or do anything. for me it is important to work in group because get bored if i worked alone.
but, i'm usually keen to know everything, and the role of everyone .. because of the details .. because the point is, as we are working in a group, so we have to collect all the work together, so, everyone must be updated .. updated to be able to complete the work and merge all things together with each other.
so, i like to work in teams however .. however i don't get upset if i am going to work alone, but i prefer to work in teams.
unfortunately, no.
i feel that everyone of us has good things and bad things, so, if i found someone does something good, so, i would try to do like this person, and if he did something wrong, so, i will not neglect it and not follow him doing this.
but .. but  overall i can't choose someone to be my role model, because of course this person is not an angel and not doing any mistakes or wrong things, we are humans by the end.
i will answer i'd rather be respected from all people, because i feel convinced by this.
liked, i prefer to be liked by the people around me  because in general, i try to let people respect me, i don't make a fool of myself, i always try to keep my dignity.
but, for the people who are close to me, i don't want them to feel with my dignity or whatever, they are dealing with me already on a personal level.
we are dealing like anyone, like .. with my family.
with my family, i don't care with the point of dealing with me in respect, but, the most important is love, i don't mean liking, but, the point of love itself.
no, i will need time, because i am not a sociable person with the persons whom i don't know before.
so, i .. i am the type of persons who sit at a corner by myself without talking with persons i met for the 1st time, although if there are many people, then i can start to talk and share with them.
but, it is not easy for me to start talking.
the start is usually hard for me.
i don't like to talk or share with anyone i don't know.
as i dealt with many different people because of the experiences i have.
i live alone by myself and i met many people so, .. i have seen many people from different social levels and from different cultures, so, it is not social level only.
it is not social level related to economic state, but i mean different social levels and different religions.
also, when i traveled, i met people there who are not of high standard level at all, and even that there was a respect in the way of dealing and that is something good, and i already have friends from there.
if this person is a close one, on a personal level, so, i don't like to be selfish person, if he is a person not close to me, then, i don't like to be stupid.
i can't tolerate stupidity, if it is from a person who is not close to me, and i don't like selfishness from the close persons, because at a point, this will affect me.
we can say emotional problems whether with my family, god or with my friends, other than that i don't feel with stress, neither work nor study can let m feel with stress.
maybe.
as it is emotional, so, we can say it is loneliness as well.
so, it is this or that.
so, it could be the point of loneliness or if i have emotional problem with .. with the persons who are close to me.
, definitely, i am not saying any non understandable things.
i say words to the point, but it is not a must that these are the words the want to hear.
but, yes, i may do this.
or did that.
but, not to say non understandable words.
because i am sure that this person sits in front me, has a great experience and he is able to evaluate me, so, for sure he will understand anything i am going to say, and will catch me if i am saying any meaningless words.
and as i mentioned before that it is important for me to find people respect me, so, i am not going to lose my dignity.
and at this point, i will say this evaluation is not important for me to be done.
i don't know.
i .. i didn't use social .. social networks for a very long time before, so, it's no problem, that was for months.
no, i didn't get upset.
but, i think without using mobile, there must be a different life to live.
by this way, i will not be able to work as ta and the mobile phone is not going to be a part of my life, and will not be a way helps to communicate with others.
but .. is the telephone will be available?
i mean, i can contact other people easily, right?
so, yes, there is no problem as long as there is another way of communication that can help me to contact with others.
it is not a must to have a mobile phone.
so, the most important for me, that there is a way i can reach them.
okay. so, i will try to convince you to continue you career as an academic field, and not continue in this regular type of work.
why? because we are living in egypt, and as we're both working in the same field, the .. the available opportunities are  in jobs that are repetitive .
so, in academic field, we don't have opportunities in the field of industry and it is something routine, it is not repeated and there is a creativity.
the only thing that is characterized by creativity without boring is the research in general and the academic life.
because in the academic life, you are dealing with students and doctors every day.
and when attending conferences, you should ideally attend many conferences so you get to know people from different universities, different networks, different social levels with different cultures.
so, this is a good and comfortable.
plus there isn't the concept of deadlines, where you're supposed to have a certain task that should be done by a certain time because the
no, in the academic life, you are feeling free.
that is if you want to .. want to .. you're the doctor, so you're in control of the course, if you want to modify it, you want to be more creative, you want to do some research, and if you get tired of research, then you can take some time off research and continue teaching and that's it.
you are the one who can control and mange the time, and after you finished teaching, then, you can go without any control.
but, here in egypt, at least if you are having a task, then, you have to do all your best until completing it.
you may need to stay at night working, you are going to live or die, but, the most important is to finish your task.
plus, you are going to have this type of clients who are going to ask you to change the things they need and you are going to start to repeat the work you did again, and this is not found here with us.
you .. you are the one who did your own research.
you .. you are the one who thought in the idea and took the decision.
so, you are the one who implement your own idea.
you are the one who know how to do it.
you go and present your own idea.
you are the one who have a control on himself.
and i think, the point of academic has no boss.
there is a boss, who is for sure higher than you in the position, but the way of dealing is not .. is not related by .. you are doctor like him, you have publications and he has publications as well, so, bot of you are talking on academic level, it is not like an order and you have to do.
this is not available in the academic life at all.
so, i would recommend you to start doing masters, and you are not going to lose anything, at least you are going to try new fields and this will help you to know what you like most, because i don’t think the bachelor studies are enough to help you what you need to do at least at the place we are in.
and maybe .. at that time decide.
or most of the people who do masters and research like the .. the .. like more the academic career.
and if you didn't like, you are not going to lose anything, you have a degree, and with this degree you will be able to use it at any other place, plus you are better than other people, because you have a degree which is something not the certificate itself, but, you learned as well and you are developed at this period of time.
i am from nasr city .. cairo, nasr city.
i was going to national school, and i was studying english and french.
since i was at secondary stage, i .. i went to the faculty of commerce, english section .. when, i was at the secondary stage, i was studying biology, but, i liked to go faculty of commerce english section, and at the same time i want to study biology, but, i don't want to go to the faculty of pharmacy.
so, since i was at the secondary stage i took my decision to go to the faculty of commerce english section, even, if i got high grade, and this is what i done, thanks god.
i have a baby and he is the one who wakes me up very very early.
we wake up preparing the breakfast, then, we wear our clothes and go outside to arrive my baby to the nursery and then arrive to work.
yes, for sure there must be a day specific for my son, to go outside together, something suitable for his age, and another day for an outing with our friends.
no.
no skip i remember nothing.
yes, i like listening to music.
i like listening to arabic sings to amr diab.
i will enroll him god's willing in french international.
why? because my husband was french and i can see that it was very beneficial at work, so to be second .. language first and english to be second he would still be good at both that's why i will enroll him in french.
well, i have always wanted to be an accountant in a company.
my father wanted me to work at banks but i didn't want banks system so i was determined to work at a company.
yes, for sure i did internships when i was at college and it was in banks after finishing college i worked at a company it was my first job and then i worked here.
no i prefer my life when i was a student honestly, because the responsibility was less, at work definitely the responsibility is much more and then i got married and have a baby so no frankly before life was much better .
yes, i have traveled before.
i traveled to thailand .. traveled to thailand.
and definitely i don't want to go there once more it's once and that's it  it was very beautiful and i would like to see another country god's willing actually spain would be the next step.
definitely i will do this because i need a better future for my son.
and he will affect my decision whether the country is suitable to live in it with my husband, and my son or not.
the country is okay, there is no problem and there would be better future for my son.
definitely, i will go of course god's willing.
look there is more than one place, in spain, and in france, and in italy a new country actually.
why? to see new things. monuments there, outings there, different life, it's different than egypt actually.
yes.
well, it's the favorite place for me for me i have to travel to el gouna once per year i mean for 4 years we have to travel to el gouna every year.
this is the place we enjoy visiting the most in egypt.
when i gave birth  when i gave birth, it was a turning point in my life actually.
what changed in my character?
i felt that i'm the life for someone else, i mean he depends on me in everything i have no idea .. i mean i can't do anything without him for example so it was the turning point in my life for example.
no at college i liked working in teams because we come up with new ideas with each other, help each other, we think in different directions which makes us see different things that i didn't see alone. so, working in teams is of course much better.
my father, my father is my role model.
he is the best person i have ever seen in you life.
there is someone at work also reminds me of my father, as well i haven't seen anybody like him.
he is a respected person, that help people, who make no harm to anybody, he is a person who do good for others, so actually both of them are the best people i have ever seen in life.
respected.
respected is .. forced to like me i mean forced %h .. he will look good to me but like this is not anybody,, i mean i can't like you, but respect if you are fine that's it i will respect .
well i took time slightly till understanding the other person but it's fine %h .. %h i mean i will go on with him, if i don't feet at ease there would be boundaries so i take time and people get to know me say that we thought that we were totally different it's only to know if the other person is good or not.
it can be if i felt that he is a person who doesn't want good for others or who is gossiping about people, if i shared something with him and i knew that he shared it with others which actually happened before and is currently actually happening with someone, that's it will be closed his file that's it i don't want to know him again.
me for example like to keep actually .. i mean keep secrets and like good for others these are the two things that i like to find in others and like good for others thank god really.
no no i have no problem in this issue, i can adapt with others, i mean it's normal .
work and the .. home responsibility, the baby i mean not responsibility .. the baby these are the most things .. both together sometime i need to slightly take a break, so the issue is very hard actually.
well, it's of course  i mean try actually because my son doesn't spend much time with me so i try after returning back %b .. spend all time with him as i mentioned that on weekend and we go out with him to compensate him that we don't spend much time with him during the week.
the work you are at work so there is no problem but it's %k .. stress no more.
no, i have just been in this problem recently and i said i have no idea that's it actually i mean it's not .. not i will not be able to talk and it seems that i don't know so that's it i will not embarrass myself and i don't know there is no problem actually  .
no, no he accepted that there is no problem, he asked me another question.
no, i can't live without a mobile.
why because i will feel that it's safe for people who will be far away from me, i mean my son, husband and parents.
i can go to my parents but sometimes for example when i'm tired it's much easier to call him so the mobile is something crucial now. no no  .
you have to travel abroad
you have to travel abroad i mean we are older than you and we are trying to take this step actually.
and the education is much better
and what i'm paying as well may be is not equivalent of what i'm getting.
so, currently i focus on my son this is the step in which i'm in right now i want him to live a life hundred times better than me.
for better future god's willing
